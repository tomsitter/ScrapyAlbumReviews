2022-03-29,Max Heilman,8,"SPRING 2022 ISSUE,FROM THE MAGAZINE,METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Meshuggah Marinate in Their 'Immutable' Sound,,"Meshuggah  offer more than consistency, having unveiled new facets of their polyrhythmic avant-metal throughout their career. Whether it was  Nothing  introducing eight-string guitars in 2002, or  obZen 's standard-setting technicality in 2008, the Swedish titans have tirelessly carved out their niche in heavy music. In this unique situation, Meshuggah's eighth album Immutable doesn't have to reinvent the wheel… Meshuggah  are  the wheel.    Nearly six years after  The Violent Sleep of Reason , opener ""Broken Cog"" effectively reintroduces Meshuggah's unmistakable tenets, gradually forming a solid backbeat and ominous leads around staccato tom-toms and cavernous chugs. It's a slow-burning start, but the mesmerising punishment remains intact once Jens Kidman's moody mutterings turn to his throaty scream amid the violent tremolo guitars and double kick drums of ""The Abysmal Eye."" Both tracks spotlight drummer Tomas Haake as the ultimate groove master, meticulously guiding the mad-scientist fretwork of guitarists Mårten Hagström and Fredrik Thordendal.    Meshuggah riffs are almost magical in their catchiness and complexity. Cuts like ""Ligature Marks"" conceal a rhythmic labyrinth under an infectious structure, with each twist deepening an immersive wall of sound. ""The Faultless"" achieves a similar effect, subverting the four-on-the-floor intro without overturning the subtone pulse. Speaking of subtone, these two songs highlight  Immutable 's greatest flex: Dick Lövgren's bass tone. His performances miraculously make the grimy nine-string guitar tone even grimier, clearly distinguishing 'heavy' from 'Meshuggah heavy.'    Any guitarist can tune low and spam their bottom string, but it's quite another matter to spend ""Black Cathedral"" sinking into a hellscape of filth-encrusted guitar strains. Even without drums, the crushing dissonance rivals extreme experimenters like Portal. Meshuggah's ambient side reappears at various junctures, notably on ""They Move Below."" The song's first two-and-a-half minutes comprise some of Meshuggah's most euphoric textures, making the main riff that much more devastating when it drops. Instrumental cuts like these clearly manifest Meshuggah's disregard for orthodoxy in favour of contorted protractions of blunt force trauma.    Thrashy tracks like ""Light the Shortening Fuse"" also have an inexplicably transcendental aura. Meshuggah's ideas progress fluidly, untethered by verses or choruses. To that effect, ""Phantoms"" subverts the generic prog-core breakdown with an amorphous tapestry of string bends and tom-toms. It's not about mosh parts, but ravishing vibes. Zoning out to the atonal guitar solos and chaotic rhythms of ""God He Sees in Mirrors"" feels like getting sucked into a wormhole of ferocious stupor.    Though ""Kaleidoscope"" won't surprise anyone with the sum of its parts, Meshuggah's chemistry makes the familiar fascinating. Kidman knows exactly where to place each syllable of his lyrics within destructive yet meticulous arrangements. Eerie motifs gliding over the chopped-up rampage of ""I Am That Thirst"" isn't groundbreaking for Meshuggah, but no one else has yet to achieve such a vital ebb and flow of barbaric melee. In this way, a cut like ""Armies of the Preposterous"" can live up to its name in baffling aggression without trying too hard.    For all its frenetic bombshells,  Immutable 's success ultimately lies in its attention to detail. Closing track ""Past Tense"" feels no less thought-out than its counterparts in delicate soundscapes and harmonic interplay. Meshuggah haven't returned to impress anyone but themselves. This is the music they like playing. It just happens to sound unlike anything else in metal. After 30-plus years in the game, Meshuggah have neither quelled their thirst for tectonic frenzy nor dried their well of dexterous musicality.

2022-03-29,Adam Feibel,7,"FROM THE MAGAZINE,SPRING 2022 ISSUE,PUNK,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",PUP's Company Loves Misery on 'THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND',,"PUP  have always known that misery loves company. While their music exists in the same space as the type of posi-punk that promises any loser or screwup can find salvation in beer-soaked power chords, they've taken on a different philosophy. For PUP, it's not really about feeling better — it's about crawling through the miles of mud and shit together.    The Toronto foursome basically perfected that idea of triumphant commiseration on their third album, 2019's  Morbid Stuff , which earned them critical acclaim, their late-night debut and a Juno Award. You might think that getting up on a stage and airing their grievances to swaths of sweaty, adoring fans night after night could help them come to better terms with the various anxieties, neuroses and self-destructive proclivities they sing at the top of their lungs, but that wouldn't really be PUP. Instead,  THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND , the group's fourth album, continues their arc with an even sharper nosedive into existential dread, hopelessness and total calamity.    When singer Stefan Babcock accidentally-on-purpose plays a sour note during ""Four Chords"" and then mutters a contemptful ""fuck,"" it's a moment that sums up the PUP mindset just about as well as any lyric could. Screw up, curse yourself, and move on. Later, play the tape back for further analysis. Repeat as necessary. ""It's honestly starting to seem like an art / How we keep tearing ourselves apart,"" Babcock sings in ""Grim Reaping,"" picking apart these acts of self-judgment and internal doomsaying amid a clash of guitars that sort of brings At the Drive-In to mind. ""I've got a bit of a complex / In case that wasn't clear from the last three sessions,"" he snarls in the thrash-metally ""Waiting,"" a wink to those who have sung along with their shared gripes and groans over the course of the band's previous three records. ""Lately I've started to feel like I'm slowly dying / And if I'm being real, I don't even mind,"" he ruminates in the choppy and poppy ""Totally Fine,"" reluctantly accepting whatever comes his way.     Fittingly, PUP's approach to their craft as musicians has gotten more streamlined while simultaneously becoming even more unpredictable. You've got all the catchy, fast-paced melodies, big singalongs, and  ooh-ooh s and  whoa-oa s that you could want in a PUP record, along with even more of the kind of outrageous metal riffing you'd hear spilling out of the garage of the smelliest kids at your high school. Meanwhile, they sneak in Latin rhythms, a blues-rock solo, church-like harmonies, and lyrics written from the POV of a heartbroken robot and an old, neglected guitar. They've added piano, synths, horns and more, which are not just a more diverse array of musical instruments but also an expanded arsenal of agents of chaos. And you'll hear vocal features by Sarah Tudzin of Illuminati Hotties, Kathryn McCauhey of NOBRO, Melanie St-Pierre of Casper Skulls and Erik Paulson of Remo Drive, lending several more voices to back up Babcock's patented nasally shout. It's all held together by the studio work of Peter Katis, who's applied a thick coating of dirt and grit that covers even their sweetest melodies.    The mess and chaos is clearly intentional. If PUP are going to write music that's beautiful, they have to do their best to also make it ugly. And while it's not a word you might normally think to use to describe PUP's music, there is quite a bit of beauty here. ""Robot Writes a Love Song"" has one of the best choruses they've ever written (it's that first one, if you're wondering), even if its central analogy doesn't hold up quite as well as  ""Matilda""  (which has its own pretty chorus!). ""Habits"" has a swinging rhythm, strong dynamics and crafty instrumentation, along with one of Babcock's truest lyrics: ""I've gotta change these habits."" The band play more quietly and ruminatively than ever on the slow-burning ""Cutting Off the Corners""; it's far from their best song, but it's a great way of showing that they've got another gear in them. They show similar restraint in ""Relentless,"" where they pull back for the choruses instead of going for another all-out anthem as Babcock delivers another signature line: ""Fuck all the dread / It's endless.""     All the while, PUP sound like they're on the verge of a total implosion (or a full-blown meltdown, if you will). They're not alone: There's plenty of commiseration going around in today's punk-rock scene. A band like Drug Church will attack their problems with bludgeoning force, while someone like Jeff Rosenstock will vent his anger with gleeful abandon. Rather than direct their rage in outward directions, PUP prefer to burn an effigy of themselves. It's punk rock for people who are prone to self-criticism, self-sabotage and self-loathing, and who can sing along with others who are guilty of the same frustrations and self-destructive behaviours with the knowledge that it's not just them. Even with their dour outlooks, they can rely on the rousing chants of big, fun pop-punk choruses to turn it into a good time.     Yet for all of its big, fun pop-punk choruses,  THE UNRAVELING  doesn't always feel like a rallying cry. The record's recurring theme is the band cosplaying as a corporate entity (giving the adage of ""misery loves company"" a double meaning, in this case), and with it comes a bit of unfocused satire that directs its criticism not as much toward the system of capitalism and consumerism and more so toward random passersby. By the time they close things out with the supremely noisy closing act ""PUPTHEBAND Inc. is Filing for Bankruptcy,"" you're more likely to be left not with a feeling of fun-filled camaraderie but with an alienating sense of bitterness. For all of their negativity, the best PUP songs remind fans that they're not the only ones going through this. Here, it feels at times like they're marooning themselves on a desert island and their only goal is survival. You want to root for these guys, so their commitment to self-sabotage can be hard to stomach. If  Morbid Stuff  taught us that anger can be liberating, this record teaches us that anger can also be limiting.     What it shows, though, is that PUP are, of course, not infallible. In fact, their whole career is based on the notion that they are extremely fallible. They're just as susceptible to being subsumed by cynicism as anyone else — and given their well-documented political awareness, social conscience and, well, mental not-so-greatness, they're probably more susceptible than the average person. And let's face it, the years since  Morbid Stuff  have not been especially kind. The band looked at a time when war, division and greed are in a bull market while hope, kindness and positivity are in the toilet, and they wrote a record that reflects that reality with all the nastiness they figure it deserves. If there's anything to be said about  THE UNRAVELING , it's that PUP have remained true to themselves.

2022-03-30,Bruno Coulombe,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",P'tit Belliveau Proves His Musical Fusion Is No Fluke on 'Un homme et son piano',,"Acadian artist  P'tit Belliveau  caught the Canadian music scene completely off guard with 2020 debut album  Greatest Hits Vol. 1 , a surrealist collection of humorous songs wrapped in a strange country-electro hybrid. Pushing his candour one step further, follow-up  Un homme et son piano  showcases a wider range of influences, while confirming that that first record wasn't a fluke.      The task at hand was significant for Jonah Richard Guimond, a former construction worker-turned-quirky music star.  Greatest Hits Vol. 1  was so unconventional in its approach to songwriting — both cheesy and sensitive, and marked by an irresistible exuberance — that it could easily have been perceived as an oddity from a self-taught musician just fooling around. In a sense, Guimond had to prove that that success was legitimate and that there was more to it than funny lines about blowing your income tax return at Taco Bell.      Of course, P'tit Belliveau could have stuck with the same recipe and released a  Greatest Hits Vol. 2 . Instead, he takes the best elements of his debut — the naiveté, his knack for crafting instantly memorable melodies, the richness of production — and pushes into a more expansive musical universe, one that draws on 1980s power ballads, hip-hop, country, funk, traditional folk, video game music, and more.      These various influences cohabit with each other in something of an organized chaos, often within the same song. The eclectic ""Demain"" is a great example: starting off with a syncopated beat paired with hip-hop flow, the song transitions into a pastoral bridge that echoes the progressive folk textures of 1970s acts like Harmonium.    It would be a bit of an overstatement to say that P'tit Belliveau explores different musical territory on this new album. However, what has changed since  Greatest Hits Vol. 1  is the confidence shown in pairing his surreal humour with more ""serious"" music. Instrumental ""Lupines"" is a heartfelt homage to traditional Acadian folk, while the conclusion of ""RRSP/Grosse pièce"" is brilliantly orchestrated.      The biggest achievement of  Un homme et son piano  is the seamless blend between live instrument sonorities and the digital world of the keyboard. Tracks like ""Des affaires vont jamais changer"" and ""Meteghan River"" bring to mind an old Casio piano with their mechanical drum beats and cheesy synth sounds. Still, both are filled with instrumental details that reveal a complex approach to production, whether it's a fuzzy electric guitar or a surprise fiddle fill.      Elsewhere, the Nova Scotian showcases his ability to transform the most down-to-earth topics into hymns. Opener ""J'aimerais d'avoir un John Deere"" is a jubilant power ballad that channels the arena rock of Foreigner, but with lyrics about owning a tractor and using it to plant seeds and feed everyone. Built on a powerful crescendo, the song features an airy choir in the chorus, an unexpected twist that gives it a ""We Are the World"" feel, but with rural poetry.      Compared to P'tit Belliveau's past work, there's a little less room on  Un homme et son piano  for the kind of nonchalance that prompted comparisons to Mac DeMarco. But there's still plenty of infectious hooks, as evidenced by the playful ""Retourner chu nous"" with silly keyboards that serve as a reminder of how Guimond is incapable of taking himself too seriously.      Just like his hybrid French and English lyrics,  P'tit Belliveau's  music exists in the margins of two worlds: not totally absurd, but never really serious either, and this is what makes it so refreshing.

2022-03-30,Wesley McLean,7,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Phife Dawg's 'Forever' Captures the Late Artist's Warm, Wise Spirit",,"​In November 2015,  a Tribe Called Quest  celebrated the 25th anniversary of their debut album  People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm  with a performance of ""Can I Kick It?"" on  The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon , backed by the Roots. The first television performance in over 15 years from the reunited  Phife Dawg , Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White marked a turning point in the group's history; not only was it the night they set their differences aside to begin recording again, but also their last live performance together.    ​Phife Dawg, born Malik Taylor, tragically  passed away  in March 2016 due to complications stemming from his battle with diabetes, a disease he'd been fighting for over 25 years. Shortly after his passing, the surviving members of Tribe announced they had been working on new music with Phife in the time since their  Tonight Show  performance, and that they would be finishing and releasing it in his honour. ​ We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service  — the group's first project since 1998's  The Love Movement  — was released in late 2016, defying all odds by living up to almost two decades-worth of hype.    It was a phenomenal offering that comfortably bookended what is arguably the most consistent and complete discography in hip-hop history. It was clear that despite the turmoil and resulting hiatus, the group's chemistry hadn't faltered, and Phife specifically showcased that he was as charismatic and vocally versatile as ever. With  Forever , it becomes clear that this time apart was pivotal in Phife's journey to reach that reunion.    ​ Forever 's 13 tracks tell an insightful and personal oral history of Tribe's hiatus from Phife's perspective. It's an album that helps fill in the blanks — not through a detailed breakdown of the 20-year hiatus, but through Phife sharing his experiences, and showcasing the growth and maturation that came with them. The album tells Phife's story as a family man, navigating his battle with diabetes and coping with the bitterness and disappointment that he felt in the wake of the dissolution of a Tribe Called Quest, among other things.    ​Phife's demeanour on the mic has always been characterized by the lovable warmth that he possesses. Whether it be his lighthearted bars on tracks like ""Buggin' Out,"" or in more solemn moments like his heartfelt verse on ""Stressed Out,"" he has always been incredibly personable in his lyrics and delivery, his verses feeling akin to a close friend cracking jokes and telling stories. On  Forever , Phife is dealing with illness, a disdain for the Tribe situation and his relationship with mortality, yet he still maintains that warmth and positivity. Despite how tumultuous things seem, he's only come out wiser and grateful for everything that he does have.    ​Throughout the album, Phife raps about taking care of his family, his love for his wife, lamenting the loss of friend and collaborator J. Dilla and, most affectingly, sharing his hope for the future. It's incredibly touching to hear that he was so optimistic about what was to come, whether the prospect of finally getting to live life without dialysis, or celebrating the new lease on life he felt when receiving his kidney replacement. This is a very mature album that does away with genre tropes and opts for authenticity and emotion.    ​It's rare for a posthumous release to not only live up up to the artist's previous work, but properly capture their aura and spirit in the way that  Forever  manages to. Despite being mainly comprised of demos and unfinished tracks,  Forever  serves as a perfect memorial for Phife. It encapsulates exactly who he was, highlights what fans have always loved about him and gives them new insight into the man that he'd grown to be. Not only is it a beautiful tribute to Phife, but it serves as a loving reminder that his music, his spirit and his impact will truly last forever.

2022-03-31,Luke Pearson,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Kellarissa Crafts Stirring Electric Hymnals on 'Voice Leading',,"The English translation of Vancouverite Larissa Loyva's solo moniker  Kellarissa  — Finnish for ""in the basement"" — has proven a fitting one. While less obvious and front-facing than a foyer full of household names, the basement is necessary, foundational, and may extend further than you know. If there's a party, it's where the cool people hang out, the regulars who know what's up.    You know Loyva would be there, having recently played in How to Dress Well and Destroyer's touring bands, as well as hip projects of scenes past like Piano, Fake Tears, and the Choir Practice. Interestingly, it's this choral background that may be the key to  Voice Leading,  her churchy, retro-futuristic fourth album of self-described femme psyche electronica. More experimental than previous efforts, it's still full of painstaking harmonies and sonorous tones made to reverberate in vaulted ceilings. It's easily her most interesting and accomplished work, a synthwave-adjacent collection of balladry and strange incantation that builds on all her previous releases.    As the title suggests, Loyva's vocals are front and centre here. Resonant, controlled, and clear as '80s stemware, they're often harmonically stacked too, upping the focus even more. It can make things feel a bit cold and impersonal at times, but once you find your way in, a refreshingly artist-first album emerges. Opening with a diaristic, almost confessional spoken word intro on ""Exposition,"" we quickly move on to a section of ghostly, chanted harmonies — all before the first bass stab arrives. It's an intriguing start that sets the tone for the unexpected things to come.    The vocals are really only half of what's going on here. Like its cover eagerly communicates,  Voice Leading  is drenched in lush, '80s-style synth work. Pads, stabs, crystalline arpeggios — it's all here, and, along with the choral, often chant-like stylings of Loyva's vocals, the album often conjures up some kind of neon electro church, with John Carpenter on ministerial duties and Vangelis as patron saint. It's definitely a cinematic listen, with a distinct lack of emphasis on beats, so don't expect to dance  too  much. Although previously-released single ""Bad Influence"" is a standout exception, a storming electro banger full of synth leads and buzzing vocoders that's over too soon.    Generally,  Voice Leading  strikes a good balance between its artier and more overt pop leanings. ""Sphinx,"" perhaps the most straightforwardly tuneful song here, features a chorus that wouldn't be out of place in any sophisticated synthpop of today. It's followed quickly by ""To the Wind At Morn,"" a beatless vocal track that takes place over a single held synth note, a low-frequency anchor for Loyva's pitch-perfect harmonies. It's beautiful and interesting — like an Irish ballad by way of  Blade Runner  — but those with a more casual relationship with Kellarissa might come up confused.    This will easily resolve for the willing and patient however;  Voice Leading  is challenging and mature, trading in some of the immediacy of Loyva's earlier work for a scope and ambition that pays off nicely.

2022-03-31,Myles Tiessen,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Jamboree Push at Conscious and Conceptual Barriers on 'Life in the Dome',,"To decrypt  Jamboree 's  Life in the Dome  is to discover a melancholic tale of desolation. The sophomore release from the Winnipeg alt-rockers sees their misanthropic tendencies tumultuously wrestle with their desire for human connection.    A partial concept record,  Life in the Dome  revolves around the fictional story of a newly-elected mayor who builds a glass dome over the city, protecting and trapping the residents inside. A concept like this feels reminiscent of other records of alienation, like  The Wall , or hell, even that  Simpsons  movie. But here, Jamboree are delicate and less conspicuous than the more well-known works.  Life in the Dome  is less about the political motivations of the dome, or a commentary on xenophobia, but rather how living in isolated segregation affects the mental wellbeing of the city's inhabitants.    The equally dominant soundscape matches the heady concepts. Songs like ""The Dome"" and ""The Birds Are Chirping"" feature distorted, washed-out guitars that envelop the listener with euphoric power, while other tracks remain intimate and muted. Through mumbling vocals, buried in a swell of depressive jangle,  Life in the Dome  is a catchy and melodic expression of doom. A clear and ever-present '90s aesthetic prevails through the album's entirety, and blending with midwest emo motifs means Jamboree settle nicely into nostalgic, sad boy college rock.    Jamboree's intentions are expressed clearly on album opener ""The Snow,"" which captures the feelings of claustrophobia and detachment felt during unrelenting winter months. Mournful vocals emerge through a cacophony of swirling guitars, lamenting, ""I heard life is cyclical, but maybe it's a straight line."" Jamboree spend the entirety of ""The Snow"" playing with similarly straightforward lyrics that manage to capture universal feelings of alienation and anxiety. ""I know that you'll sit and watch me as I fucking drown, you clown"" is also just a great way to express dissatisfaction with someone.    The towering sonic volume in which Jamboree dabbles on ""The Snow"" is simultaneously intimate and dissociative. The meditative spoken-word tranquility carries the same emotive charge as the chaotic highs of squealing guitars and bombastic drums.     Life in the Dome  is filled with moments of quiet reflection and introspective melodies. ""Another Day"" plays with the downtrodden malaise of slowcore, and features an alluring slide guitar. At the same time, ""Quebec"" reflects on the high cost of university textbooks, trouble making rent and other financial stresses. However great and honest these moments are, Jamboree show their elite nature when exploring the raucous side of experimentation.    ""The Trees"" builds into a brilliant full-frontal assault of intertwining melodies and distorted guitar solos, and while ""Be True"" starts as a ""Say It Ain't So"" clone, it soon transforms into its own singular, hard-rocking hysteria. The nucleus of ""Walk"" is a complete breakdown of any reasonable melody, and Jamboree's inclination to follow their curiosity helps make  Life in the Dome  sound uniquely itself.    Jamboree are honest in both their lyrics and instrumentation. While the record may be about the life of people trapped inside a city,  Life in the Dome  feels more like a band trapped inside their own minds, fiercely creating art for sanity's sake.

2022-03-31,Alex Hudson,7,"MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Red Hot Chili Peppers Rekindle Their Fire on 'Unlimited Love' ,,"Red Hot Chili Peppers  have had many different lineups over the years, but they only really sound like themselves when on-again-off-again guitarist  John Frusciante  is in the fold. That impression is reinforced by  Unlimited Love  — a sprawling, exciting album full of playful chemistry between four musicians who, yet again, bring out the best in one another.    The album has all the usual hallmarks of the Chili Peppers: goofy funk-rap gibberish ( ""Poster Child"" ), sunburnt grunge ballads ( ""Black Summer"" ), harmony-drenched name-dropping of California (""White Braids & Pillow Chair""), and cloud-scraping fretboard heroics on guitar (""The Great Apes"") and bass (""One Way Traffic""). Longtime super-producer  Rick Rubin  is back behind the boards after sitting an album out, and he helps the group lean into their classic, summery sound.    As nice as it is to hear RHCP back in their wheelhouse, they sound best when they pick up the energy and cut loose a little. ""Here Ever After"" is propelled by Chad Smith's pounding toms,  Flea 's dirty bass thrumming and Frusciante's ominous tones. The song has a gleefully silly pseudo-rap delivery that only  Anthony Kiedis  could pull off; same goes for the ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" flow of ""One Way Traffic."" Instant standout ""Aquatic Mouth Dance"" sounds like a fairly typical Chili Peppers funk jam (think ""Charlie"") until it spins off into an approximation of caterwauling New Orleans jazz in the giddy final passage. The climactic ""These Are the Ways"" begins slow but veers into bluesy hard rock; that explosive distortion returns on ""The Heavy Wing"" in a towering chorus sung entirely by Frusciante. The rave tones of ""Bastards of Light"" draw on the  solo electronic music Frusciante has been making in recent years , surpassing 2016's Danger Mouse-produced  The Getaway  as RHCP's most adventurous dalliance with synths.    Frusciante will likely get much of the credit for the band's reinvigorated sound. He's the thinking person's Chili Pepper, the one apologists will point to as the spiritual, sensitive soul to balance out the rest of band's horned-up goofiness. While there's no question that his sense of pop songcraft is perhaps the band's greatest strength, his bandmates turn in similarly strong performances here: see the way Flea walks his way through playful riffs on ""Watchu Thinkin'"" or how Smith propels the sighing ""White Braids & Pillow Chair"" to an unexpected country finale with his chug-a-lug beat. Frusciante has spoken about  approaching  Unlimited Love  without a sense of ego , and he often takes a backseat to let his bandmates rise to the occasion; he's more restrained with his vocal harmonies than he has been on his last couple albums with the band.    The veteran Red Hots are showing some signs of decline — specifically the 59-year-old Kiedis, who has always had more charisma than technical singing ability, and here relies so heavily on pitch correction that it drains some of the personality from his voice. Stripped-down moments, like the dreary momentum-killer  ""Not the One""  or the pop-funk comedown ""It's Only Natural,"" plainly expose the warbling, robotic processing on Kiedis's vocal tracks.    But largely, the most surprising thing is how quickly the Chili Peppers have fallen back into lockstep. The band's albums with outgoing guitarist  Josh Klinghoffer  weren't bad, exactly —  The Getaway  in particular holds up quite nicely — but, when listening to  Unlimited Love , there's a strong sense of everything falling into place and order being restored.

2022-04-04,Alex Hudson,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Jack White Turns Everything Up to 11 on 'Fear of the Dawn',,"""The easy way out would be to cater to the person who just wants me to record 'Fell in Love With a Girl' or 'Lazaretto' over and over again, and then keep writing 55 songs with heavy riffs in them. That's just boring to me. I just don't have the patience to numb my brain that much.""     Jack White  said that in a  2018 interview with Exclaim!  about his experimental third solo album,  Boarding House Reach . But White has clearly rediscovered his love for heavy riffs, since fourth solo outing  Fear of the Dawn  just might be the most consistently heavy record in his entire career.    White's energy is at a fever pitch for nearly all of  Fear of the Dawn , with lead single  ""Taking Me Back""  setting the tone for this frenzied album. It's not a red herring: title track ""Fear of the Dawn"" soaks its swing time groove in low-end fuzz and sci-fi synth screeches, while the caveman blues licks of ""What's the Trick?"" trace a line all the way back to the White Stripes' pre-fame albums.    This isn't to say that White is repeating himself.  ""Hi-De-Ho""  is a particularly freaky offering, beginning with a dramatic overture of swing legend Cab Calloway's singing before doing a complete 180 with a rap verse from  Q-Tip . It's a bit of a mess, but it's entertaining to hear White take such a big swing. ""Into the Twilight"" blends its guitar crunch with a prominent vocal sample, while the computerized guitars of ""The White Raven"" and ""That Was Then (This Is Now)"" are so effected that it's difficult to tell what's a six-string and what's a synth. The short instrumental ""Dusk"" reemerges in the extended outro of ""Morning, Noon and Night,"" a compelling collision of jammed-out rambunctiousness and studio trickery.    Ironically, it's the quietest song here — the bluesy, slow-burning closer ""Shedding My Velvet"" — that possibly leaves the biggest impression, opting for sexy swagger over brash stomp. This bodes well for White's next album,  Entering Heaven Alive , which follows this summer and is said to be a much mellower listen.    White has explored many of the ideas heard on  Fear of the Dawn  before: the robo riffs of ""Blue Orchid,"" the atmospheric hip-hop rhythms of ""Freedom at 21"" and the bloopy synth squiggles of  Boarding House Reach  are all touchpoints here. But  Fear of the Dawn  pushes these ideas so far that it still feels like a bold step forward.    By splitting his 2022 albums into two distinct projects and saving his quieter material for  Entering Heaven Alive , White has delivered his best release since 2012's  Blunderbuss , and one of the most consistently exciting albums in his 25-year-career.

2022-04-06,Cole Brocksom,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Deanna Petcoff Puts Honesty at the Heart of 'To Hell with You, I Love You'",,"Deanna Petcoff  has gathered a following in Toronto's music scene with a lovestruck, forlorn brand of indie rock. Her first full-length LP,  To Hell with You, I Love You , is an album for hopeless romantics. Each song alone holds its own nuanced emotionality. From self-deprecation stomper ""Trash Bag,"" to the heart-wrenching piano ballad ""Sing with Me,"" Petcoff's lyrics show there's more beneath the surface than what's at first glance. When taken all together,  To Hell with You, I Love You  paints a picture of love, loss, and longing.    On opener ""Failing Upwards,"" the first taste of Petcoff's songwriting arrives with a dreamy shuffle and a hook begging to be sung along with. The refrain, ""I know you're not trying to break my heart, but you're doing a bang-up job / And I told you I'm not trying to lose your trust, but at least I'm failing upwards"" fills a soaring melody, placing the most important and relatable lyrics alongside the catchiest part of the song.    It's a technique Petcoff uses to great effect on tracks like ""Devastatingly Mediocre"" where she asks herself, ""Why do I search all night for a chance to say your name?"" or ""That's What I Get"" with the lament, ""That's what we get for always playing pretend, that's what we get for always saying it's fine / it hurts to know that we can't even be friends, that's what we get."" These hooks convey complex emotional ideas — like wondering why you let yourself fall for someone who doesn't meet your standards, or knowing you need to move on from a relationship even if you don't want to — in short, memorable fashion. Petcoff expands from there in the verses with clean, beachy guitars and windswept atmospheres.    These aesthetics aren't groundbreaking, but Petcoff still finds room to explore in the styles that she's curated on this project. More upbeat tunes like ""I Don't Wanna Get Over You"" and ""Failing Upwards"" have an ethereal, yet driving feel, tiptoeing just outside of garage rock with riffs that harken back to the late-2000s/early-2010s indie rock heyday.    Meanwhile, the slow-burning deep cuts offer some variety. ""As Much As I Can"" features plucked acoustic rhythm guitar and echoey rimshots that give the tune a bossa nova feel. ""I Didn't Lie"" starts small with some very bedroom pop digital percussion, but quickly builds to a grandiose swell of strings and voices. Album closer ""Sing with Me"" is only piano and Petcoff's whisper-quiet vocals, exactly all it needs to let the impact of her songwriting show.    There's an honesty to the music of  To Hell with You, I Love You . Though some tracks are more memorable than others, they all serve to put Petcoff's voice and words in the spotlight where they belong. Her songs are confessional and intimate, every word and note carrying emotion; she can make you want to bawl your eyes out in one breath, and then dance the tears away in the next.  To Hell with You, I Love You  shares a piece of Petcoff's heart that's asking you to sing along.

2022-04-06,Alan Ranta,8,"PUNK,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The Linda Lindas Tap Into Youthful Punk Potential on 'Growing Up',,"The Linda Lindas  make no attempt to hide their youth. They named their debut album  Growing Up , and its title track is a spirited pop-punk anthem celebrating the vigour and camaraderie of children who happen to grow up together, making mistakes and building character. If that song was the only thing to go by, one might think the Linda Lindas are some kind of  Hannah Montana  reboot, but they did not make a Disney album. The Linda Lindas are mad as hell, and they'll tell you why in no uncertain terms.    The precocious Los Angeles-based punk band is comprised of sisters Mila and Lucia de la Garza, an 11-year-old drummer and 14-year-old guitarist, along with their 13-year-old cousin/bassist Eloise Wong and 17-year-old friend/guitarist Bela Salazar. They all sing and switch around instruments too. Don't judge this book by its cover. The Linda Lindas may not actually have anyone named Linda, but this band is not messing around. Underestimate them at your own peril.    Long before  Growing Up , the Linda Lindas had been paying their dues. After forming for a one-off set at the L.A.-area Girlschool music festival in 2018, they continued on as a band to open for the likes of Phranc, the Dils and Alley Cats, and eventually performed with Best Coast, Alice Bag and Bleached. An opportunity to write a song for Netflix documentary  The Claudia Kishi Club  inspired them to start writing their own original music, and soon after, they appeared in and recorded songs for the soundtrack of Amy Poehler's coming-of-age feminist film  Moxie .    Sadly, there is no age restriction for experiencing racism and sexism, and being half-Asian and half-Latinx, these young women have lived with that ugly reality all of their lives. Before the pandemic, a schoolmate of Mila's made a comment amplifying something racist his father had told him. Exacting Tito Puente's revenge, the band wrote a song about it called  ""Racist, Sexist Boy.""     Their timing was perfect. The Linda Lindas went viral in May 2021 with a video rendition of ""Racist, Sexist Boy"" recorded live at the Los Angeles Public Library. As the video spread, prominent rockers such as Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine), Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) sang its praises, while legendary punk label Epitaph  immediately signed the band .    One must be wary of packaged rebellion, of course. Avril Lavigne was initially marketed as ""the anti-Britney"" based on appearance, but if you compare their music, there isn't much difference beyond genre — an unsurprising observation considering they both employed the same songwriting teams, like the Matrix. With that in mind, there are elements of  Growing Up  that sound a little too good to be true. This album was definitely not recorded at the library. There are moments polished to an unreal shine, but it makes sense when you look at the credits.      Growing Up  was produced, mixed and engineered primarily by Carlos de la Garza at his own Music Friends studio in Los Angeles. In addition to drumming in bands like F.Y.P. and Reel Big Fish, Carlos mixed Ziggy Marley's Grammy-winning self-titled album and engineered Tegan and Sara's multiple-Juno-winning 2013 effort  Hearthrob , as well as Wolf Alice's Mercury Prize-winning 2018 album  Visions of a Life . He has produced everyone from Paramore, Cherry Glazerr, Best Coast and Bleached, to Epitaph bands such as Bad Religion, HUNNY and Teenage Wrist. He is kind of a big deal. He is also the father of Mila and Lucia, and produced the Linda Lindas' eponymous debut EP from 2020, so they had an easier path to get where they are than someone randomly mailing demos to Epitaph.     That said, spend time with the Linda Lindas, and it's obvious they weren't simply handed everything. They seized their opportunities. All one has to do is watch them absolutely crush it on  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  to see what is coming. They have the swagger and style, and they don't care if anyone doesn't like it.      The opening track on  Growing Up ,  ""Oh!""  hits the ground running with its throwback punk chant and enthusiastically minimal melodies, sounding like Joan Jett covering the Ramones. Its lyrics exude the sense of frustration and futility, speaking out against societal wrongs that we feel powerless to change, as well as the guilt if we say nothing. This sentiment is more broadly reflected in ""Talking to Myself,"" which beckons commiseration in talking about things that we can't help, and in ""Growing Up,"" where the kids talk about things that aren't fair. Talking about things can be therapeutic, as is listening to this album.     Other moments are a little breezier. The surfy harmonizing power-pop pluck of  ""Nino""  lands somewhere between La Luz and Blondie, while lyrically paying tribute to a fantastic feline reminiscent of the cat jam ""Monica"" from their self-titled EP. They even throw in a little bossa nova flavour on ""Cuantas Veces"" (""How Often"" in Spanish), further demonstrating the influences and experience beyond their years.    A studio recording of ""Racist, Sexist Boy"" closes  Growing Up . It is as fierce an example of political hardcore as you'll find this side of Bikini Kill, whom they supported at one of their first-ever gigs at the Hollywood Palladium in 2019. It heralds the second coming of riot grrl with a side of kawaii cuddle-core, channeling the fiery rock power of the Runaways, the new wave gloss of the Go-Go's, and the pop-punk exuberance of Blink-182.    With every moment of unflinching social commentary, the Linda Lindas let listeners in to the smouldering embers of youthful promise we all have before the weight of the world eventually crushes our spirit. For as wide as their appeal could be, their eyes are open wider. The Linda Lindas do not pull any punches. Judge this book by its cover, and it will judge you right back. The library is open.

2022-04-07,Alan Ranta,8,"SOUL & FUNK,R&B,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Tanika Charles's Voice Is the Leading Light of 'Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly',,"Tanika Charles  was in the process of taking her career to the next level when the pandemic cancelled everything. She tasted success with her 2016 debut  Soul Run  and 2019 follow-up  The Gumption ; both were nominated for Juno awards and long-listed by the Polaris Music Prize. Charles had planned a significant tour to give  The Gumption  a well-deserved victory lap and solidify her status as one of Canada's all-time greatest soul divas when suddenly there was nothing.     Charles has now emerged with her third studio album,  Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly . Crafting songs with regular collaborators like Robert Bolton, who helped write her first two albums, she forged new connections amidst the otherwise isolating lockdowns, exploring new contexts for her powerful yet elegant voice.    The album's theme is expressed in the poetry of its rather Canadian bilingual title. A butterfly of the night, particularly when articulated in the silkiness of its original French, is a beautiful way of referring to a moth. Generally overlooked insects, moths tend to unassumingly blend into the background until they bump into your porch light. Yet, if people knew them as night butterflies instead, perhaps they'd get a smidge more shine.     To be clear,  Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly  is not a concept album about moths. Most of its lyrics speak to the blossoming, failing and endurance of love. The concept of not taking things (or people) for granted is clearly expressed in the dreamy slow jam ""Don't Be So Entitled."" Charles warns, ""you don't own what you can't see"" in one of those perfectly composed can't-believe-it's-not Motown moments, with backing singers echoing the falling melody of her plaintive vocals. If the right person hears this song at the right time, it could save relationships.      Although the lyrics of ""Hold Me (Like a Grudge)"" speak of being confined in a relationship, Charles sounds freer in the rawer setting. Her commanding voice punches through the funky instrumental, a gently simmering boom-bap beat accented by jazzy guitar and comforting cooing. ""Million Ways"" is so clean that it ends up sliding by fairly easily, yet it feels like the whole world stops when Charles demands ""hold on"" in the gripping hook of ""Hold Me (Like a Grudge).""     A few tracks on  Papillon de Nuit  hit that blessed throwback note. ""Rent Free"" could easily be a Daptone Records single, with Charles sounding as epic as Sharon Jones as she sings of a bad ex-partner who still lives rent-free in her memories. Closing the album on a nearly opposite note, ""Honey Baby"" is an old school duet with Khari McClelland lifted up by jaunty, off-key piano, crisp drums and psychedelic soul guitar, culminating with a string of delightful food innuendo pillow talk.     Charles has found new strength in her perceptive ability to find the right settings for her voice, and that hits home on the title track. On ""Papillon de Nuit,"" she sings that she isn't lost, she's breaking ground, and that sure is what it looks like from over here. There's no denying her metamorphosis into something greater on ""Different Morning."" Her dreamy vocals and the life-affirming verse from  DijahSB  perfectly meld with the addictive afterparty essence of the instrumental. They rock a grooving beat with funky bass guitar, dreamy horns and woozy electric piano, with a touch of organic percussion brilliantly balancing the 808 plinks.    Regardless of how many nominations it receives or how the industry votes,  Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly  is already a winner.

2022-03-11,Manus Hopkins,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Ghost Give Up Satan for Arena-Sized Ambition on 'Impera',,"As  Ghost 's popularity rose over the past decade, it was obvious there would come a day when the Swedish occult-metal outfit would move away from their over-the-top Satanic themes into more accessible, chart-friendly territory. 2018's  Prequelle  saw the band, led by mastermind Tobias Forge, play it safer than ever. While Ghost showed that they were able to produce songs that could comfortably be played in arena settings, they also lost some of their bite in doing so. The good news for longtime Ghost fans is that with  Impera , Forge has created a more thematically interesting and more musically complex album than its predecessor. The bad news is that  Impera  is still more of a continuation of the trajectory the band has been on its past few years than a return to their devil-worshiping earlier days.     Let's start with the good things. ""Call Me Little Sunshine"" and ""Twenties"" are some of the strongest songs in Ghost's catalog thus far, the former featuring one of the catchiest riffs in the band's career, and the latter making incredible use of unorthodox rhythmic work — something we actually hear quite a bit throughout  Impera . Closer ""Respite on the Spitalfields"" is a near-perfect song, taking Ghost's signature sound and ramping up the '70s and '80s elements to create an epic, heroic culmination, stopping just short of ending up in self-indulgent prog rock territory.    The album's theme, centring on the fall of empire, serves the music well, playing into a grandiosity and epic feel for which Ghost's old sinister sound has now been completely swapped out, for better or worse. Ghost have always made catchy songs with pop elements, and most of  Impera 's tracks are no exception, but holding the album up next to the band's earlier efforts — which sound like hymns for an evil church service — only a shadow of the upside-down gospel music that first put Ghost on the map remains. These songs sound as if they were written specifically to be played in arenas by a world-class rock band, not at strange, cult-like gatherings.      Impera  isn't without its missteps, however. Thankfully, it doesn't include overly long instrumental tracks like  Prequelle  did, but it does have some unnecessary interludes that could have just been parts of the tracks into which they lead. The power metal-esque guitar work and chorus of ""Kaisarion"" come off sounding cartoonish, even for Ghost. ""Hunter's Moon"" is a fine cut, but it doesn't have a memorable chorus or lead riff to really make it a standout.      Impera  is a solid album and an obvious next step in Ghost's career. It's bittersweet to see the campy Satanic days firmly behind the band, but any old-school fan should still be proud to see what the band has achieved, and it's clear that  Impera  is the album Ghost needed to take their career to the next level. They've stuck to their guns enough that they may not change the minds of many of their scathing critics, but with a new, less evil image and feel, they should be able to attract a more mainstream audience and continue their trajectory into becoming a flagship band for 21st century rock. Still, it's sad to see the old Ghost go.

2022-03-15,Luke Fox,8,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Benny the Butcher's 'Tana Talk 4' Is a Quality Capstone to His Mixtape Series,,"Benny the Butcher , who recently inked a deal with  Def Jam , could be on the brink of going mainstream. But he's always been major. If a big label budget and the trappings that come with it — R&B hooks, radio-ready singles, more crossover cameos — are around the corner, the Butcher's final indie hurrah is a wonderful parting gift to his diehard fans.    There is nothing out of pocket about  Tana Talk 4 , sticky with tales and testaments from Benny's drug-dealing past. Also, there is not one song worth skipping. Twelve tightly packaged joints, 40 minutes of crunchy beats produced exclusively by  the Alchemist  and long-serving Griselda beatmaker Daringer, and bars upon bars. If you're looking for something experimental, glance elsewhere. If you're satisfied with straight-up good rap music, the search is over.    In a statement, Benny said he had ""a chip on his shoulder"" creating this project, which revives a mixtape series he began in 2004. It was 2018's  Tana Talk 3  that jolted the Buffalo bard's trajectory, stirring up enough buzz for him to branch outside his posse and record with  Harry Fraud  and  Hit-Boy , and reap collaborations with the likes of  Black Thought ,  Jadakiss ,  2 Chainz  and  Pusha-T . ""On a shoestring budget, I showed them what I could do,"" Benny reminds on this go-round.     Tana Talk 4 's level of quality starts sky high with ""Johnny P's Caddy,"" a reference to the Cadillac that Benny's father drove him and  Westside Gunn  around in as kids, fostering his son's love of music through the car speakers. Alchemist whips up a soul platter for Benny and  J. Cole  to puff their chests and put their pens to the test.    Smart, forceful writing continues throughout as Benny's deliberate delivery slices through the horns of ""Throwy's Revenge"" and the frenetic synths of ""Guerrero."" Usual suspects  Boldy James ,  Conway the Machine , 38 Spesh and Westside Gunn drop by, adding welcome vocal texture to Benny's predictably clear and metronome-like cadence. ""Back 2x,"" featuring the underrated Stove God Cooks, hits you in the chest with a double barrel of punchlines and arrogance. It's precisely the type of song born out of a harsh winter in Upstate New York.    The greatest curveball is  Diddy  showing up to lend ad-libs to the well-executed concept track ""10 More Commandments,"" a sequel to  the Notorious B.I.G. 's 1997 favourite ""Ten Crack Commandments."" Daringer whips up some trippy snares and a nervous keyboard line for Benny to school aspiring street pharmacists. Lesson 17: ""Take care of the people around you / They only appreciate how you value loyalty when they eatin' beside you.""    If you weren't a fan of Benny prior,  Tana Talk 4  likely won't win you over. But if you were, the latest fuel for  Griselda 's hot streak will keep your Caddy bumping until the next blast outta Buffalo.

2022-03-17,Bruno Coulombe,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Lisa LeBlanc's 'Chiac Disco' Is a Dance of Humour and Homage,,"Along with pioneers Radio Radio and up-and-coming acts like Les Hay Babies and P'tit Belliveau,  Lisa LeBlanc  has been at the forefront of the  Acadian music boom  of the 2010s. Building on her trademark wit and humour, LeBlanc's new album  Chiac Disco  harks back to the dancing days of the 1970s, combining funky rhythms with her Acadian dialect to produce something colourful and exuberant.     LeBlanc has always had a knack for telling stories with ironic humour in a way that feels like she's poking fun at herself, while also exposing our own quirks. In the past, she would treat her songs with more down-to-earth arrangements, using the banjo as a reminder of her folk roots. This time, everything feels bigger, with shiny orchestration and dance pop rhythms that instantly recall acts like the Emotions or  Boney M .     In a sense,  Chiac Disco  continues on the same path as LeBlanc's 2020 EP as Belinda,  It's Not a Game, It's a Lifestyle , which drew on a wide range of influences from new wave to electronic dance music. Here, the result is more cohesive, as the whole album sounds like a nod to another era.    Opener ""Pourquoi faire aujourd'hui"" sets the tone in brilliant fashion, with kitschy strings and spacey keyboards that recall the sparkling allure of  Chic . Standout track ""Veux-tu rentrer dans ma bubble?"" is more funk-driven, powered by an irresistible groove and punching horn riffs à la  James Brown . With its overt references to 1970s music,  Chiac Disco  lies somewhere between pastiche and homage. Although LeBlanc and co-producer Benoît Morier approach their topic with a certain sense of derision, it's also clear that they love their material.    They don't just borrow from funk and disco. The intro of ""Dans l'jus"" recalls the soundtracks of  Ennio Morricone , while the chord sequence of the quieter ""Me semble que c'est facile"" unmistakably evokes  Led Zeppelin 's ""Stairway to Heaven."" The only downside is that the tone feels a bit less personal at times, as if LeBlanc was portraying a character.     Lyrically,  Chiac Disco  largely opts for humour and lightness, as LeBlanc offers clever observations on modern life: the joys of procrastination, gossiping at Tim Hortons, Acadian cuisine (""pas d'épices, juste du sel,"" she sings on ""Le menu acadien"") or when leaving the couch feels like an impossible quest. The truth is that these texts would have worked just fine with the  folk-trash  that used to characterize LeBlanc's style, but imbuing them with sparkling instrumentation gives them a totally different feel.      Chiac Disco  works best when its joy is paired with a certain feeling of grandeur, as on ""Entre toi pi moi pi la corde de bois"" which echoes the sweeping arrangements of  Lee Hazlewood . But because it's more polished, the album doesn't quite match the intensity and grit of the Polaris Music Prize-shortlisted  Why You Wanna Leave, Runaway Queen? . Still, its total sense of freedom and abandon make for a very rewarding listen.

Despite the modest tone — there's not a whiff of pretension to be found — Dawson's album is a triumph. Fans of the guitarist and producer will not be disappointed, and newcomers will be floored by the sheer talent on display.      Gone, Long Gone  is the Juno-winning musician's first collection of songs since his 2016 album  Solid States and Loose Ends , and the album is more than worth the wait. Dawson wrote (or co-wrote) nine of its 10 songs, in addition to producing, recording and mixing. Featuring a roster of talented musicians, including Grammy nominee  Allison Russell , his latest release is a masterclass in independent music production.      Gone, Long Gone  is coherent and consistent without feeling repetitive or tedious. There's a common personality connecting the tracks, which are all unique and interesting. It can be difficult to balance versatility in a collection of songs without sacrificing cohesion, but Dawson pulls it off flawlessly. His passion centres an album that defies genre convention — with ""roots"" or ""folk"" feeling the most apt, although ""blues"" or even ""singer-songwriter"" feel equally appropriate.    Effortlessly sliding from joyful to mournful and back again,  Gone, Long Gone  is a fully realized album that exudes creative energy. The opening song ""Dimes"" is a funky blues piece with a great hook and punchy horns. The penultimate track, ""Cicada Sanctuary"" is a stripped-down instrumental that's just Dawson playing guitar — and it's fantastic.    ""Kulaniapia Waltz"" is surprising instrumental that leans into the Hawaiian string sound to great effect. Both ""King Bennie Had His Shit Together"" and ""Bad Omen"" are fun and full of personality. ""Gone, Long Gone"" is a wistful acoustic song, featuring just the right amount of strings and pedal steel. The ending track, ""Time Has Made a Fool of Me,"" is the softest and most contemplative of the batch. It's a bittersweet note to end on, but not unpleasantly so.    That these very different-sounding songs are equally compelling speaks to just how phenomenal Dawson's artistry is on  Gone Long Gone .

2022-03-17,Kaelen Bell,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Charli XCX Makes a Messy, Exciting 'CRASH' into Her Own Legacy",,"It's here! Five months, some  mild Twitter beef  and a surprisingly late-in-the-game (for a  Charli XCX  album, anyway) leak later,  CRASH  has finally careened out of the garage. The rollout for Charli's fifth and last full-length record for Atlantic has been bumpy, defined by a surprising — and vaguely worrisome — level of hostility between fan and artist. So, was all the hubbub worth it? Now that it's arrived, where does  CRASH  leave us?     Those who were disappointed by the record's sleek handful of singles can breathe a sigh of relief:  CRASH  is largely stronger than the sum of its disparate parts. However, those who were hoping for some kind of definitive Charli album will have to hold their breath a little longer.    Those semi-controversial singles account for some of the record's weakest moments —  ""Good Ones""  remains too faceless, while the frenetic, bubbly production on ""Baby"" can't make up for its grating chorus — though they're strengthened in the context of their more dynamic counterparts. ""Move Me"" is all icy clatter and crystalline atmosphere, with beautiful, aching verses offset by an ecstatic (if familiar) chorus. The spring-loaded synth figure that spirals beneath ""Constant Repeat"" is another highlight, with its warbled, circling outro feeling earned despite the song's relative brevity.     The new jack swing of the title track introduces  CRASH  with a blast of irrepressible energy, opening the record on a manifesto à la  Charli 's ""Next Level Charli."" It's the most obvious example of Janet Jackson's apparent influence. But, like a handful of songs on  CRASH , it feels a touch constricted. The chorus might've hit once, twice more, while the tightly-coiled guitar solo could've — and should've — been allowed to snake beyond the song's confines.      The second half of the record stumbles more than the first. The stomp-clap groove of ""Yuck"" feels too much like a Dua Lipa B-side, while ""Every Rule"" is too toothless — featuring a traditional Charli topline melody, an issue that pops up a handful of times across the album — to make much of an impression at all. Taken as a whole however, the album manages to even out in terms of quality, a consistent energetic clip and some intuitive sequencing helping prop the weaker songs against the sturdy scaffolding of tracks like ""New Shapes"" and ""Move Me."" The record hits its nadir at ""Used to Know Me,"" featuring another prominent interpolation (this time of Robin S.'s ""Show Me Love"") that, much like ""Beg for You,"" feels like the lukewarm result of a stan focus group.     CRASH  takes flight the further Charli strays from the quasi-ironic ""main pop girl"" narrative cage that she's trapped herself in, when she allows her destabilizing energy to rattle the bars. ""Lightning"" is both the record's strangest and longest song, clocking in at a whopping three minutes and 47 seconds of frenzied percussion, sparkling Spanish guitar and vocoder-gargled vocals. It's also probably the album's best song, a taste of the weirdness that Charli is so adept at maneuvering within.    ""Lightning"" is also the only track on  CRASH  that feels sufficiently informed by the record's blood-streaked, Cronenbergian visual world. It's a bracing screech of burnt rubber and impacted metal amongst all the spotless chrome and polished glass; it's hard not to wish that Charli and her co-conspirators had leaned a bit further into this chaos.    There's been plenty of (premature) talk — on Twitter anyway, where 99.9 percent of Charli XCX opinion-havers seem to be — surrounding  CRASH 's perceived lack of quality and/or cohesion, the record's rollout leaving some fans wary. It's not necessarily hard to see why. Charli herself seems unsure of what  CRASH  is actually meant to be, oscillating between her particular brand of stan-approved self-aggrandizement and a vulnerable defensiveness that's come to define the record's narrative. Is it a go-for-broke attempt at genuine crossover radio play? If so, it fails by any obvious chart metrics. Is it an ironic commentary on pop stardom and industry machinations? If so, it falls short again. The unrefined narrative conceit that's been built around the album muddies a pretty strong set of songs, gently recalling the conceptual framework of St. Vincent's  Daddy's Home  — the sensation that you're listening to an album that, by its own creator's tacit admission, is perhaps unfit to speak for itself.    It's when you slough away all that baggage that you get to the viper-red heart of  CRASH ; it's a blindingly bright, gleefully energetic collection of pop songs from an artistic who's good at making exactly that. It's not Charli's strongest full-length statement — that honour still belongs to  Pop 2  or  how i'm feeling now , albums that encapsulate Charli's particular flavour of mangled, caustic beauty — but it's the kind of brash, whiplash-inducing pop album that only she seems capable of making at the moment. It's a bit messy, but most crashes are.

2022-03-21,Alex Hudson,5,"EP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Weezer's 'SZNZ: Spring' Is as Annoying as Renaissance Faire Cosplay,,"There's something entertaining, even admirable, about the way  Weezer  leader Rivers Cuomo continues to follow his weirdest whims. The results are sometimes excellent (2021's orchestral  OK Human ), occasionally dreadful (the plastic pop of 2019's  Black Album ) and often somewhere in between (the faux hard rock of 2021's  Van Weezer ) — but no matter where Weezer land these days, listeners can usually count on them to take a big swing.    Their latest off-the-wall concept is  SZNZ , a series of four EPs arriving on 2022's equinoxes and solstices, loosely inspired by Vivaldi's  The Four Seasons . Why? Who knows! Why not, I guess.    Weezer have always sounded like an extremely summery band.  Spring , on the other hand, is a slightly harder vibe to pin down, and Weezer give the season a pastoral, fantastical, pseudo-pagan interpretation. The band's medieval-style press photo looks like they wandered off the set of  Lord of the Rings ; Cuomo is wearing elf ears. He  told NPR  that he wrote the album while imagining himself in Shakespeare's  A Midsummer Night's Dream , except that play is quite literally about ""midsummer,"" so even Cuomo seems to be struggling to pin down the feeling of spring.    The results careen awkwardly between the trad-folk of a Renaissance faire and Weezer's usual crunchy guitars. ""Opening Night"" is particularly bizarre, with mandolins, recorders and lyrics like ""Shakespeare makes me happy / So happy."" The song then abruptly pivots with chugging, distorted guitars that are classic Weezer. Has there every been a song with such an utterly abysmal verse and such a good chorus?    This wild unevenness is typical for  Spring . The Renaissance cosplay schtick is grating, as if Weezer learned everything they know about folk music from  Monty Python and the Holy Grail , but they sound fantastic when they're just being themselves. Jake Sinclair, who produced the band's post-millennium high water marks  White Album  and  OK Human , is back as co-producer, and maybe it's thanks to him that ""Angels on Vacation"" could almost pass as vintage Weezer (or at least 2014–2016 Weezer). ""The Garden of Eden"" has clunky lyrics about Velcro shoes and Adam and Eve, but the grungy doo-wop tune is lovely, and Cuomo cleverly throws a little hip-hop cadence into his vocals.    Lead single ""A Little Bit of Love"" lands somewhere in the middle of  Spring 's two styles, its merry mandolins and stomping beat channeling the cheerful sound of a post-Mumford car commercial. There's even a very on-the-nose ""hey-ho"" bridge, just in case it didn't already sound enough like the Lumineers.     Spring 's relentless optimism takes Weezer out of their sweet spot, since they've always excelled at injecting upbeat pop with bittersweet melancholy. Then again, the themes of rebirth and renewal feel appropriate for this moment in history; a couple of of the songs explicitly allude to COVID-era reopening, as ""The Sound of Drums"" includes a chorus of ""It's good to see my old friends / Man, it's been so long,"" while ""All This Love"" finds Cuomo declaring, ""I forgot how to live, how to love, how to give / How to sing with a mask on my mouth."" These lines capture the idea of spring far better than silly mandolins or harpsichords.     Spring  certainly isn't the worst Weezer album (don't worry,  Pacific Daydream , that title still belongs to you!), but it's frustrating to hear them sabotaging their own songs in a futile attempt to pin down the sound of a season. So far,  SZNZ  feels less like a lofty concept and more like silly gimmick.

2022-03-22,Adam Feibel,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Camp Cope Eye Personal and Artistic Growth on 'Running with the Hurricane',,"The main takeaway from  Camp Cope 's widely praised sophomore album was the Melbourne trio's biting commentary on the role of women in the music industry. In particular, ""The Opener,"" the punnily titled first song on 2018's  How to Socialise & Make Friends ,  leapt out of the speakers and made clear the band's intentions to push back against an environment that viewed groups like theirs as rarely more than a supporting act. It was a record that seethed with anger over the many faces of misogyny in music, but also displayed an emotional range that gave it depth and complexity. Musically, the band built upon their scrappy indie rock sound — snarkily punky and charmingly folksy in almost equal measure — and rose to greater heights after their eponymous debut had made them a success in Australia.    Now, having said what they needed to say, Camp Cope feel refreshed, rejuvenated and newly contented on their third album  Running with the Hurricane .  It's not that singer-songwriter Georgia Maq's anger about systemic equality has evaporated, nor have her wounds suffered from love, heartbreak and failure entirely healed. But musically and lyrically, these songs feel like an enormous weight has been lifted off the group's shoulders.    While  How to Socialise  dealt with feelings of anger and pain,  Hurricane  is focused on what's on the other side of adversity. With that comes more tender songwriting and brighter, gentler arrangements. Here, Camp Cope are a lot less Bikini Kill and a lot more Hop Along. They often evoke the soft-rock stylings of Canadian icons like Sarah McLachlan, Jann Arden and the sentimental side of Avril Lavigne, and there are Joni Mitchellisms to more than a few of Maq's melodies. Yet with organic production by Anna Laverty, and defiantly animated rhythm work by bassist Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich and drummer Sarah Thompson, their music still has that distinctly DIY spirit of underground indie-rockers.    On the title track, Maq sings about overcoming chaos and darkness to come out stronger on the other side — ""There's no other way to go / The only way out is up"" — and it bursts with the sunny energy of a Sheryl Crow tune. Throughout  Hurricane,  Maq is constantly singing about opening herself up to life. In power ballads ""One Wink at a Time"" and ""The Screaming Planet,"" she opens herself up to affection, but also to solitude. In the radiant choruses of ""Jealous,"" she opens herself up to vulnerability with a new person. And in the spunky yet subdued ""Blue"" and ""The Mountain,"" she sings of loving with all her heart, in spite of everything. It ends with the stunning ""Sing Your Heart Out,"" closing the record with a push toward self-acceptance: ""You are not your past, not your mistakes, not your money, not your pain / Not the years you spent inside / you can change and so can I.""    Early on, Camp Cope showed that they can strike out with enough force to make a dent in the music industry.  Running with the Hurricane  shows that they can love with just as much intensity. The songs are filled with empathy, compassion and encouragement, and there's a new tenderness in Maq's voice that makes the music all the more likely to touch your heart. It's an album that's expressly designed to comfort the afflicted, rather than afflict the comfortable.    They may have over-softened, though. There are a lot of simply beautiful songs here, but not unlike previous Camp Cope efforts,  Running with the Hurricane  is held back by sameness. If the band had added some more dynamics to their sound, allowing themselves to indulge in the wild and unruly side we had previously heard, the arrival at peace and harmony would be all the more satisfying. There's no calm quite as relieving as the one just after a storm has passed. This is a band that's clearly intent on making beauty out of chaos — if we could hear that happening in real time, there's no doubt it would be explosively cathartic. Still, it's rewarding to see Camp Cope find the kind of personal and artistic growth that so many long for.  Running with the Hurricane  finds them more in control than ever ( Run For Cover )                           POP AND ROCK   ALBUM   REVIEWS   MUSIC              More Camp Cope",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/camp_cope_running_with_the_hurricane_album_review
2022-03-22,Safiya Hopfe,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Aldous Harding Finds Freedom in Stylistic Collage on 'Warm Chris',,"New Zealand's  Aldous Harding  is a master of negative space. Her prowess is quiet: she weaves intimate walls in hushed proclamations, pauses, and sighs. Brief silences and muted splatters of percussion amplify the rich emotional crescendos of her songs, which often read like surrealistic diary entries, and at other times like letters written in dreams. She mixes metaphors, paints composite memories, and takes her inner child to shows. Her elegant bridging of the metaphysical and the mundane teems with images which seep into one another and grow, wobbling, like droplets of water. Her work is faithful to subtlety and prudence. Even in interviews she is soft-spoken but deliberate, appearing to measure each word: carefully, unblinking.    Her fourth album  Warm Chris  — the follow up to 2019's critically acclaimed  Designer  — is an exception. Here, Harding's power lies in where she frees herself rather than where she restrains herself. Whimsical, bizarre and somehow still rich with grace,  Warm Chris  is a stylistic collage that twists and turns defiantly at each moment categorization begins to feel plausible.    Harding has spent enough time meditating in raw, uncanny tongues about surrender, pleasure, and performance that it is only natural that she has found space, at long last, to play. Her second album  Party  — of which the title track was a lullaby that seemed at once to mourn past, present, and future — practically oozed melancholy, emulating the soulful folk of Karen Dalton and the stalking ambience of Portishead in accounts of loss and respite.  Designer  magnified solace in strange places, merging more expansive textures of brass and synthesizers with acoustic guitar.    Harding's bittersweet ruminations have often boasted a peculiar warmth, but  Warm Chris  — produced, as  Party  and  Designer  were, with John Parish — truly evokes celebration. ""Cut it up / Put it in my hand / You've become my joy, you understand,"" Harding sings after the opening chords of ""Ennui,"" which march gleefully toward anticipatory hums. ""Got a little colour in the back / I love it.""    It is not simply the thematic swapping of sorrow and solace for relief and hope that sets  Warm Chris  apart from Harding's last three records. Her songs still exist in an emotional world weighted by anxiety, absence, and the tension between desire and existential truth. In this world, though, these songs dance rather than pace — the inner child she crooned about on  Designer  mutters, smacks her lips, and stomps her feet.    In the span of only 10 tracks, Harding tries on a plethora of personas, proving the instrument of her voice to be a superpower of versatility. On the chorus of ""Tick Tock,"" she teases and taunts, ""Wanted to see me / Whatcha gonna do? / Now that you see me / Tick tock!"" On ""Fever,"" she speak-sings about disappointment and reunion with the soulful rasp of Lucinda Williams in a rolling sea of tin and brass. Even as she sings ""I still stare at you in the dark / Looking for the thrill in the nothing,"" she sounds almost victorious.    On the stripped-down title track, Harding's voice takes on a flighty tremble reminiscent of Big Thief's Adrianne Lenker, while on ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain"" she adopts a Waxahatchee-esque twang as a banjo plucks shyly along with a piano in the background. ""Passion Babe"" sees her slide between a mumbling drawl and childlike exclamation in acrobatic leaps so subtle they almost sound effortless. On ""Staring at the Henry Moore,"" Harding inserts the quack of a duck between verses that could have been sung by Vashti Bunyan. Her sure-footed vocal shifts vary so dramatically on the record that it is difficult, at times, to believe that she alone is singing.    The throughline is unmistakable, though, in her elastic voice and whimsy-fuelled instincts — she is free and she knows it. Without sacrificing the elegance for which she has been revered, Harding tries new palettes, painting impressions of small worlds in whatever textures emerge and trusting them as they do.  Warm Chris  is neither refined nor contained: it wanders and wonders, affirming the sheer joy of curiosity.

2022-03-23,Sarah Bea Milner,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Cowboy Junkies Make Folk Classics Their Own on 'Songs of the Recollection',,"Cowboy Junkies  have always known how to make a good cover. The long-running Toronto alt-country group broke out into the mainstream in 1988 with  The Trinity Session , which went double-platinum in Canada and platinum in the US thanks mainly to the Velvet Underground cover ""Sweet Jane.""      Songs of the Recollection , their latest, marks a bit of return to form for the group, seeing them reinventing folk and country tracks from songwriter powerhouses like Gordon Lightfoot, Neil Young and Gram Parsons. Here, they put their stamp on iconic songs, transforming the music to match their signature style.    It's a fresh and exciting album that channels the obvious passion these musicians share for the artists being covered. Margo Timmins (vocals), Michael Timmins (guitar), Peter Timmins (drums) and Alan Anton (bass) have been playing together for almost four decades, and it shows in the vibrancy of their playing. From start to finish,  Songs of the Recollection  reverberates with the tight-knit energy only found in groups who've played together for a long time.     Songs of the Recollection  is, fittingly, a real throwback, reflecting different alt-country stylings from the past 30 years. ""No Expectations"" features a stripped-down arrangement that calls back to the mid- and late-'90s female-led country pop and rock, while the opening ballad ""Five Years"" gets a powerfully emotional treatment worthy of David Bowie's original version. ""Ooh Las Vegas"" features haunting layered contralto vocals that are a bit reminiscent of mid-aughts Neko Case. Nothing in  Songs of the Recollection  feels particularly innovative, but the musicianship impresses nonetheless.    The clear standout here is ""The Way I Feel,"" first released on a Lightfoot tribute album in 2003. Michael Timmins delivers a guitar solo with just the right amount of grunge, elevating the song by highlighting the darker side of Lightfoot's sound. It's a respectful tribute that really honours the original, but expands the material enough to stand on its own.     ""Marathon,"" a digital bonus track from Cowboy Junkies' 2011 Vic Chestnutt covers album  Demons , is another noteworthy track on the album. It's a slow, moody 6/8 waltz that transforms the original. The Cowboy Junkies version is a droning funeral march with gentle percussion and subtle wails throughout — a distinctly Western take that updates the song for the 21st century while still echoing the past.     For better or for worse,  Songs of the Recollection  gives off the impression of going out to see a cover band at the top of their game. It's a bittersweet reminder of the days when live music was more accessible. No doubt existing fans will love this about the album, but newcomers might be turned off by the uniform approach throughout. Still,  Songs of the Recollection  is a joy to listen to, start to finish.

2022-03-24,Daniel Sylvester,8,"ALBUM,SOUL & FUNK,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC,REVIEWS",Ibibio Sound Machine Fuse Influences to Prove Peerlessness on 'Electricity',,"Within the first moments of ""Protection from Evil,""  Hot Chip 's Al Doyle delivers a rubbery synthline so badass that it establishes  Ibibio Sound Machine 's fourth full-length as a bent-circuit exploration though funk, disco and whatever else they want to throw into the mix.    But don't get it wrong, the octet aren't out to cop Hot Chip's oeuvre — it's in fact the opposite, as Doyle and his bandmates are partially indebted to Ibibio Sound Machine for their late-career adventurousness. Fans of each other's music for nearly a decade,  Electricity  signals the first collaboration between the two electro collectives.    Although it's produced by Hot Chip and vastly influenced by Afrobeat, Tropicália and British acid house, this communicative LP comes off as remarkably inimitable. This may be due to the ubiquitous African, South American and European makeup of the force that is Ibibio Sound Machine.    On the clubby ""17 18 19,"" vocalist Eno Williams stretches her customarily controlled voice to fit the song's dazzling disco aspirations, repeating this same trick for the clattering downbeat of ""Almost Flying"" to create an otherworldly mix. However, for as many tools as Williams utilizes on songs like the rhythm-bending ""Truth No Lie"" or the youthful chants of ""Something We'll Remember,"" her band is able to match her boundless energy flawlessly.    Aside from members of Hot Chip, Ibibio Sound Machine are joined in the studio by a half-dozen musicians who allow songs like the Afrofuturistic stomp of the title track and the joyous Fela Kuti sound collage ""Oyoyo"" to wander off in busy and exploratory sonic interludes that are just as charming and vivid as the bandleader.    On tracks like the slinky, sleek ""Afro Ken Doko Mien"" and ""Casio (Yak Nda Nda),"" Williams sings in Ibibio – a language she spoke primarily while growing up in Nigeria. Her fluid delivery and energy turn the aforementioned cuts into tight, elastic soundscapes; meanwhile the yearning, brassy ""All That You Want"" and the late-night Moroder-influenced ""Wanna See Your Face Again"" prove that the group can deliver strait-laced dancefloor bangers with ease.    As Ibibio Sound Machine have continually kept their lyrics insightful, honest and political in nature, Williams mostly promotes a level of positivity throughout the album, using the extroverted delivery of ""Freedom"" as an act of protest. On  Electricity , Ibibio Sound Machine manage to come across as enormously focused and imaginative while staying true to their wildly diverse, free-flowing modus operandi.  ( Merge )                           ALBUM   SOUL & FUNK   DANCE AND ELECTRONIC   MUSIC   REVIEWS              More Ibibio Sound Machine",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/ibibio_sound_machine_electricity_album_review

The Philadelphia quartet force audiences to think about privilege within hardcore music while also creating space for those whose voices the genre has long pushed to the sidelines.  Diaspora Problems  is Soul Glo's crowning achievement to date, combining hardcore with hip-hop, elements of extreme metal and heavy electronic music to create truly a unique listening experience.    From a musical standpoint,  Diaspora Problems  takes hardcore music and sprinkles in some wonderful oddities. The album opens with ""Gold Chain Punk (whogonbeatmyass),"" the heaviest Soul Glo song to date, including the most chaotic breakdowns ever written by the band.    The tracks that follow each put unique twists on Soul Glo's sound while keeping hardcore as their guiding principle. Whether its the horn sections on ""Thumbsucker,"" the death metal-infused ending of ""Fucked Up If True"" or the major Death Grips energy on ""Driponomics,"" Soul Glo are putting their own imprint on hardcore. This is perhaps never more apparently than on album closer ""Spiritual Level of Gang Shit,"" which mashes up the excellent vocal flow of guests like McKinley Dixon and lojii with atonal blast beats and distortion, feeling like a culmination and celebration of everything that came before it on the album.    Vocalist Pierce Jordan delivers stellar performances across  Diaspora Problems . This is a thematically dense record that tackles everything from the politics of hardcore to self-worth to generational trauma. The album is so densely packed with context that sitting down and pouring over the lyrics is strongly recommended. This is especially true of ""Driponomics,"" featuring vivid lines like, ""40 years of Reaganomics / The world in service and shit / Deliver food we spit in / Can't even cook for they kids.""    Jordan contributes just as much musically as he does contextually, contrasting against his bandmates with interesting rhythms on ""GODBLESSYALLREALGOOD"" and ""(Five Years And) My Family."" Jordan has moments like this continually throughout the record, making the music even more dynamic and rewarding listeners who make continual revisits of the album.    Exploring so many sub-genres of hardcore while simultaneously telling many different stories,  Diaspora Problems  vaults Soul Glo into the conversation as one of the most important heavy bands in 2022.

For  the Weather Station 's Tamara Lindeman, the answer has been in her back pocket this whole time. Arriving 13 months after  year-end-list staple   Ignorance ,  How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars  was written at the same time as her acclaimed fifth LP and recorded live off the floor in three days in March 2020. In Lindeman's words, ""I think of it almost as the moon to  Ignorance 's sun, the exhale at the end of the phrase.""     How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars  is a quiet album. There's Lindeman, her piano and faint wisps of additional, jazz-inflected lap steel and woodwinds like the colours of a fading sunset. Where Lindeman is often flanked by two ( and sometimes three ) percussionists when performing songs from  Ignorance , here, there is no percussion.     What's left are gentle piano ballads that are filled with deeply intimate moments and thoughts. Not the moments that you shout about or throw a party for, but the everyday events and musings that make a life. There's dancing, walks are taken, stars and birds are gazed at, a head rests on a lover's chest. Many of the topics Lindeman grapples with on  Ignorance ,  including the climate crisis , are present here too, but delivered with a softer touch. On ""Endless Time,"" Lindeman reflects on how precarious our lives are in the shadow of climate change. ""They don't put that in the paper, you won't read it in the news,"" she reminds us. ""You have to use your eyes.""    On  How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars , Lindeman also touches on the act of songwriting itself, which makes listening to the record feel as if you are witnessing the creative process of not only this collection of songs but of  Ignorance  as well. ""I'm tired of working all night long, trying to fit this world into a song,"" she sings on ""To Talk About."" But just because  How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars  is unadorned doesn't mean it feels unfinished. By design, these songs are understated but Lindeman's voice is so strong and incredibly beautiful that what she gives you is fulsome. Paired with the album's multitudinous lyrical details, Lindeman delicately succeeds in fitting the world into her songs.

2022-03-02,Kaelen Bell,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",​Nilüfer Yanya Finds Colour Amidst the Greys on 'PAINLESS',,"In his posthumously released 1996 children's book  My Many Coloured Days , Dr. Seuss wrote that, on bright blue days he flapped his wings; on yellow days he was a bee; on orange a circus seal. But of grey days, Seuss wrote, ""Everything is grey. I watch. But nothing moves today.""    The illustrated book is based on a manuscript that Seuss wrote in 1974; the following year, German visual artist Gerhard Richter would write in a letter to Dutch museum director Edy de Wilde that the colour grey ""evokes neither feelings nor associations… It has the capacity that no other colour has, to make 'nothing' visible.""     Nearly five decades later,  Nilüfer Yanya  offers her own album-length rumination on grey and its multitudes of nothing.  PAINLESS , the London songwriter's nervy second full-length, is an account of in-betweens and half-feelings; the unflinching "" LESS "" of its title is not a declaration of pleasure but an oath of numbness.     Yanya is no stranger to the vexations of grey matter. On 2019's fuzzed-out ""In Your Head,"" she sang of being ""dark and confused / Oh, though I cannot tell if I'm paranoid / Or it's all in my head."" Her florid debut,  Miss Universe , was a portrait of anxiety and disquiet before anything else, but its coterie of distinctive collaborators and an unnecessary conceptual framework — ""cloaks and sleeves,"" in Yanya's own words — threatened to swallow her writing. On  PAINLESS , Yanya whittles her sound to an essential minimalism, offering an unobstructed peephole into the Ames room of her mind.     The record is defined by figurative greys. Finite conclusions are rarely drawn, and Yanya often finds herself grappling with debilitating self-doubt, singing from a haze of indecision and mistrust — of lovers, of the world, of her own mind. Read on paper, the album's lyrics — ""Troubled don't count the ways I'm broken""; ""You can hurt me if you feel like""; ""Does sadness pick you to the bone?"" — can be brutal in their forthrightness and despair.     But, as Richter noted in a 1986 interview on his series of grey paintings, this nothingness ""has to be turned on its head in the end, and has to come to a form where these paintings possess beauty."" Crucially, Yanya understands this principal too, streaking her grey days with invigorating neon. For all its fear and itching paranoia,  PAINLESS  is a buzzing thrill.     Built mostly on looped, inflexible drum beats and Yanya's inspired guitar playing,  PAINLESS  sheds much of the jazz and R&B of her earlier work in favour of industrial-flavoured rock music. Last year, she  covered PJ Harvey's ""Rid of Me"" in an at-home performance for KEXP . The energy of that rendition — equal parts icy and impassioned — informs the sonic world crafted by Yanya and co-writer and producer Wilma Archer. The essence of Harvey's early music is there in the bluesy, sour riffs that power ""L/R,"" while the glitching, foreground-filling beat of ""Chase Me"" echoes the British icon's synthetic experiments on 1998's  Is This Desire?     Elsewhere, Yanya channels Radiohead circa  In Rainbows  on towering centrepiece ""Midnight Sun,"" while aquamarine closer ""Anotherlife"" plays like a spritely reimagining of the Blue Nile's nocturnal synth pop. Mostly though, Yanya just sounds like herself, subsuming these myriad influences into her own exacting palette of rigid beats and nimble guitar. Just as muscle memory can take you through the motions regardless of your mind's disarray — ""Sometimes it feels like you're so violent / autopilot,"" Yanya sings on ""L/R"" — these concise, aerodynamic songs bely the diffuse turmoil of her inner dialogue. On ""The Mystic"" she's ""not halfway up to speed,"" while over the needlework guitar of ""Stabilise"" she admits that she ""could feel something / But it could be nothing.""    Yanya rarely deals in black and white on  PAINLESS , but when she does — as on the Jazzi Bobbi-assisted ""Belong with You"" — she swings between the poles with an exhilarating, contradictory violence. ""Please don't cry / I run out of patience,"" Yanya sings on the tightly coiled opening verse, followed by the record's most objectively beautiful put-down: ""Sick of this / I don't even like you bitch."" But then, as if grafted from a devotional ballad, comes the chorus, repeated with a wild-eyed intensity: ""I belong with you.""    To her credit, Yanya never attempts to meld these warring ideas. She allows herself to snap like a rubber band between perspectives until, as the song careens to a close, she faces the inevitable crash: ""I said there won't be a next time / But now I can't see the stop sign.""     Nothing moves on a grey day. But in that stillness the heart continues to pound and flutter; the skin tingles and the brain weathers invisible storms. The power of  PAINLESS  is its willingness to stand in the eye of that unseen hurricane, submerging itself in disorientation and contradiction and unknowing.

2022-03-02,Alan Ranta,9,"POP AND ROCK,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Maylee Todd's 'Maloo' Is a Path to a Brighter Future,,"Throughout her career,  Maylee Todd  has delivered her outsider-pop quirks with heavy dose of whimsy, evident as early as her 2010 debut  Choose Your Own Adventure , which brimmed with Stereolab-esque playfulness.  Maloo , her fourth album and first for Peanut Butter Wolf's famed Stones Throw Records, is a collection of science fiction lullabies from the perspective of her digital avatar, after whom the album was named.     Formerly from Toronto and currently creating in Los Angeles, Todd became enamoured with the positive possibilities of virtual reality during the pandemic, envisioning a sort of social media alternative focused on amplifying our shared dreams rather than reinforcing status symbols. As such, she imbued  Maloo  with a utopian technological vision, the likes of which  Grimes' AI girl group  and the robots from Björk's ""All is Full of Love"" video might conceive if they dreamed about a children's album with Kid Koala instead of electric sheep.    While  Maloo  is Todd's most musically and conceptually sophisticated album to date, the hints of absurdity expressed in the lyrics and melodies harken back to  Choose Your Own Adventure . The title of that album — sonically steeped in bossa nova, folk and soul — was a major clue as to her provocative style, taken from an interactive series of printed books where the reader makes choices on behalf of the stories' protagonists. As Todd walks listeners through the limitless possibilities of  Maloo , she shows how that foundational idea has evolved from analog paper to the digital cloud.     Maloo  trends more into late-'90s Björk territory with modern advancements, flush with jewelry box melodies that feel warm despite their obvious processing. The dreamy instrumental ""Tiny Chiffon"" sounds like the background music from a highly emotional  Final Fantasy  cutscene or a Mort Garson song inspired by an autogenerated houseplant. The sultry sway of ""No Other"" takes Erykah Badu to the outer space cuddle puddle, while the softness of ""Dream with You"" brings to mind Supersempfft's optimistic kosmiche-pop. All of the songs are distinct in style, yet the common threads in their sounds and imagery really tie the room together. Like a calmer alternative to King Gizzard's  Nonagon Infinity ,  Maloo  plays well on repeat, and it's so interesting that it is a joy to let it ride three or four times in a session, picking out different gestures and moments each time.    The lullaby concept is translated rather literally as well. Todd mentions lucid dreaming in ""Age of Energy,"" the opening track that builds the world in which  Maloo  exists. Later on, she explicitly explores dreaming in ""Dream with You,"" a trippy love ballad near the album's end. Those tracks bookend the record with the kind of 'existence is wrapped in a dream' feeling that arguably held together the surreal rotoscope-animated vignettes of Richard Linklater's  Waking Life .    Further embracing technology, Todd directed  a trippy 360-degree virtual reality video for ""Infinite Program,""  created in collaboration with Kyvita. Set to a woozy, atmospheric, vaguely tropical tune, the lyrics speak of a sort of sentient planet like Stanisław Lem's  Solaris , but less haunting and more empathetic. The health of Todd's planet is tapped into the psyche of its inhabitants, so when their mental health suffers, so does the environment. To heal oneself is to heal the world; to hate is to destroy it.    Though bathed in the fantasy of science fiction, her words contain the key for reality to move forward. In her dreams, technology brings people together rather than tearing them apart. As such,  Maloo  isn't just an avatar or an album. It's a path to a brighter future.

2022-03-03,Bruno Coulombe,8,"JAZZ,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Thus Owls' 'Who Would Hold You If The Sky Betrayed Us?' Soars on Woodwind Wings,,"Thus Owls  are a rare gem in the Montreal music scene, one that keeps making music according to their own terms. This statement rings especially true with their fifth full-length,  Who Would Hold You If the Sky Betrayed Us? , an expansive double-album rooted in avant-garde jazz, improvisation and experimental rock that challenges you to rethink your expectations of what an indie band should sound like.      Previously released 2018 effort  The Mountain That We Live Upon  showcased the power of the six-string, with a lineup that featured four guitarists resulting in thick, multi-layered textures. This time, the husband-and-wife duo of Erika and Simon Angell decided to focus on the timbre of the saxophone to provide their new release with a distinct sonic identity. The result is a bit unconventional for a modern rock album, although the influence of  David Bowie 's  Blackstar  (acknowledged by the band) looms large.      As much as the sound of Thus Owls relies on the chemistry of the Angells, the guest performers are the real stars here. Saxophonists Claire Devlin (tenor), Adam Kinner (tenor) and Jason Sharp (bass sax) play an essential role in shaping these 13 new compositions, often providing the basic melodic material on which the music is built. Tracks like ""Balconies"" and ""Who Would Hold You?"" illustrate this perfectly, with labyrinthine brass lines that reveal the influence of both post-bop jazz and the American minimalist school of  Terry Riley  and  Steve Reich .      Elsewhere, the band alternates between progressive psychedelia and languid trip-hop. ""I Forget What I Remembered"" first echoes  Portishead  with its steady, slow beat, before the sax harmonies turn it into something that wouldn't have been out of place on  King Crimson 's  Lizard . Opener ""Bleeding"" is another strong number, harking back to the prog-folk movement of the 1970s, but with the brass providing more abrasive orchestrations. Throughout the record, long-time collaborator Samuel Joly proves especially versatile on drums, capable of shifting from a jazzy, cymbal-driven sound to something more pounding when the mood commands it.      With its 66-minute running time,  Who Would Hold You If the Sky Betrayed Us?  leaves ample room for improvisation, and the band takes full advantage of that. On ""Above the Sun,"" Simon Angell channels the guitar hero in him with a shredding solo, while ""Perfectly Younger"" embraces cacophony in an almost  Ornette Coleman  manner. Yes, there are a few eccentricities here and there in terms of virtuosic display, but nothing that feels like plain overindulgence.      Despite some jarring stylistic shifts, the album maintains its coherence thanks to the deep, slightly raspy voice of Erika Angell which acts like a guiding presence. Some of the lyrics were obviously tainted by the pandemic, and songs like ""Lover Mother"" and ""I Miss Her Like My Country"" reflect on her feelings of being isolated from her Swedish family during that time.      Thus Owls appear to have been rejuvenated since the release in 2015 of their  Black Matter   EP, on which they started to let go of the more indie folk aesthetics of their previous work. Instead, they've embraced a more ambitious sound with elaborate and intricate arrangements, proving that the harder it is to categorize music, the better it usually is. There's no point in trying to decide if  Who Would Hold You If the Sky Betrayed Us?  is jazz or rock. It's both of these things, and much more.

2022-03-03,Leslie Ken Chu,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Scott Hardware Upgrades His Compositional Mind with 'Ballad of a Tryhard',,"Scott Hardware 's third full-length,  Ballad of a Tryhard , is the Toronto artist's most sprawling, beautiful album yet. On 2016's  Mutate Repeat Infinity , he relied on techno-sourced repetition and as little instrumentation as necessary to liven up a dance floor. 2020's  Engel   found Hardware combining decaying electronics and baroque pop. In these ways, both albums drew listeners into an intimate space, like a club or cavernous performance hall.  Ballad  takes Hardware's craft to new heights of sophistication and richness, establishing him as a master of melody, an exquisite popsmith, and a brilliant compositional mind.     Ballad  is a Polaroid collection of a sojourn to the coastal city of Elche, Spain, where Hardware spent weeks wandering historic streets and playing piano until sunup. Each of the album's 10 songs is a suite in and of itself, built around acoustic and stringed instrumentation which grants them a tangibility less present in the synthetic pulsations of Mutate Repeat Infinity, and even the avant-pop of  Engel . ""Summer"" and ""Is Something Wrong Tonight?"" burst forward and upward in full symphonic glory and splendour. Bass notes lilt like plants in the heat on ""Another Day Ending""; coupled with vaporous keys, the song is as sultry as a Mediterranean evening, the very ambience in which Hardware steeped himself.     Musically,  Ballad  paints an ambrosial picture of a European tryst, like scenes of  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy at their most smitten in  Richard Linklater's  Before  trilogy. But Hardware's lyrics dispel any  romantic fantasies.  Time slows down, allowing him to attain some respite  —  ""I won't say a thing / No, the quiet's more powerful / And you can get lost at the top of your mountain,"" he sings on the cloudbusting, harpsichord-powered ""Dentera""  — b ut it's not enough. On the slippery ""Watersnake,"" a ghost from his past interrupts his flickers of serenity. Along with his personal relationships, he's unable to find sustained peace knowing that the world at large  — the Earth and the human species that inhabits it —  is on the brink of disaster. He struggles to not let these circumstances or unwelcome presences knock him off the summit of peace he's scaled.     A sense of fatalism pervades  Ballad . It's even embedded in a shrugging song title like ""Another Day Ending."" But Hardware isn't passive. He's determined to ride life to its fullest  despite  the circumstances.  ""September you don't scare me / I'm in no hurry / Let sand sift through my hands / Do I look worried?"" he challenges on the uneasy ""Metaterranean."" He also displays determination  —  and resilience  —  when he sings, ""Come on, light / Kiss my eyes / Call my name / In the crowd / I can wait / 'Cause I've waited / I can climb and crawl to find my way tonight"" on ""Another Day Ending.""     Hardware also finds a sense of connection on  Ballad  absent in his  previous albums, both of which expressed feelings of isolation and alienation . On ""Love Through the Trees,"" he sings, ""If I'm with you, I feel my edges soften / We both know that don't come around that often."" And if not with people, he at least finds oneness with the world around him. ""I'm alone / I don't mind it / And no work / Just the quiet / I take a breath, and I see / The room is taking breaths with me,"" he observes on ""Another Day Ending.""     Fraught with inner turmoil but contrasted by soaring, uplifting music and rare moments of contentedness,  Scott Hardware spends  Ballad of a Tryhard  trying to relish in tranquility while bracing himself as the world crumbles around him. When it comes to developing as a songwriter, though,  Ballad  is one more  stepping stone to achieving an artistry that's as indefinable as it is unpredictable.

2022-03-04,Mark Tremblay,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Vein.fm Hone Their Melodic Might on 'This World Is Going to Ruin You',,"Sophomore albums are never a pleasant process.  Vein.fm 's debut,  Errorzone , was so well-received by the hardcore community (even topping Exclaim!'s list of  Best Metal and Hardcore Albums of 2018 ) that a follow-up would appear to be a daunting task.  This World Is Going to Ruin You  uses familiar hardcore tropes while taking big swings at larger, anthemic moments, capturing the expansion of a young band's sonic palate that, for the most part, pays off immensely.    On their second album, Vein.fm have taken care in mapping out a sonic experience for the listener. The record's sequencing leads breakdowns on songs like ""Lights Out"" to stand out amongst more sonically mellow turns, such as ""Wherever You Are"" and ""Wavery."" Individually, these subdued songs on the record do not seem particularly impactful when played out of album order. When mixed in amongst the chaos, however, these melody driven songs really propel the listen forward, breaking up the heaviness nicely.    For fans of panic chords and breakdowns, Vein.fm have some of their best to  This World Is Going to Ruin You , showcasing seasoned craft and execution on ""The Killing Womb"" and ""Orgy in The Morgue."" Drummer Matt Wood has some of his best performances on this record, highlighted by his blast beats on ""Versus Wyoming"" and his intricate patterns throughout ""Inside Design.""    Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of  This World Is Going to Ruin You  is its variety of melodic choruses, some of which land a bit flat. A performance from  Thursday 's Geoff Rickly on ""Fear in Non Fiction"" feels out place, sapping the song of its momentum. Considering the song's chaotic build-up, this vocal performance as the payoff feels anti-climatic and disappointing. Similarly, the chorus of ""Magazine Beach"" is very jarring, feeling forced and unnatural.    It is commendable to see Vein.fm incorporate these larger melodic moments, and in spite of varying results, not all of them are subpar. The haunting, beautiful album closer ""Funeral Sound"" is the album's finest track. Featuring sparse piano and faint vocals, the band triumphantly meld Deftones-indebted melodies into their punishing brand of hardcore.                 This World Is Going to Ruin You  feels like a peek into the future of what Vein.fm are going to become. While not everything works out as intended, the seeds have been sown for growth and refinement. The album does a great job of acknowledging the band's past, and where one can expect them to move forward.

2022-03-08,Leslie Ken Chu,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Vancouver Underground Heroes Apollo Ghosts Go Widescreen on 'Pink Tiger',,"Apollo Ghosts  have long been the beating heart of independent music in Vancouver. Since forming in 2008, they've become renowned for their festive live shows from coast to coast, powered by four LPs and a scattering of EPs, including 2010's Polaris long listed  Mount Benson  — all with a six-year gap in their tenure, as they disbanded between 2013 and 2019. Three years later, their  celebrated comeback  has reached a new peak with their most ambitious effort yet, their first double album,  Pink Tiger .      The album was written over those three years, which were marked by loss. Singer-guitarist  Adrian Teacher 's father was dying. Teacher lost hearing in one ear. Nature was hurting from wildfires, land development and resource extraction. But with time, Teacher's hearing returned. He planted trees with his partner Amanda P., who's also Apollo Ghosts' drummer (though Brutal Poodle's Dustin B. has assumed that role live). Their bassist Robbie N. is having a baby this spring. The life cycle goes on.       Pink Tiger  reflects the seesawing of life's highs and lows in two distinct sides, evenly split into 11 tracks each. The first,  Pink , is comprised of acoustic home recordings that grapple with helplessness and confusion in the wake of loss. Knitting an acoustic melody around piano, ""Melatonin 5G"" speaks to the album's preoccupation with beginnings and endings: ""I severed all my ties / With all the stupid things that went wrong in my life / And I took a trip with some friends."" The warm embrace of the  title track 's piano and acoustic guitar offers all the tenderness of the Mountain Goats'  Get Lonely . ""All of these comforts / All of these lies and fire pit philosophies / Hoping for answers / Talking with God,"" a soul-searching Teacher sings, trying to wrap his head around the way the universe works before he musters gratitude and an optimistic outlook: ""Friends are family,"" he sings. ""Maybe it's over / Maybe it's not.""      Elsewhere, a ragged weariness drapes over  Pink . Finger-picking, a steely guitar tone, and a freely flowing melody tinge ""Morning Voice"" with American Primitivism, though they're offset by evaporating keys. On ""Dirty Spoons,"" Teacher's voice dangles so low that it borders on a Bill Callahan impression; the sparing track even lingers like one of the Smog singer's placid, reflective songs.      For the album's second half,  Tiger , Apollo Ghosts enlisted the recording talent of Jordan Koop (Orville Peck, Wolf Parade) at the Noise Floor and the mixing expertise of JC/DC Studios' David Carswell (Destroyer, the New Pornographers). Whereas  Pink Tiger 's entire first half feels like a long, slow breath — there's a moment on ""To Set the King Bloom"" when the music winds down to a pause, Teacher inhales deeply, and he begins again, patiently rebuilding the song — ""Tiger"" boasts energetic guitar rock that mostly looks past grief and toasts the joys of life, namely friendship and music.      Though  Tiger  contains no chantable anthems, one of Apollo Ghosts' specialties, it packs plenty of catchy moments and the band's other defining characteristics. Teacher continues to spin keen observations into sharp musings. ""When you've got fuck all inside you / You'll finally have something to say,"" he sings on the unhurried ""Spilling Yr Guts."" And in his hands, nostalgia is never a bad word — like much of Apollo Ghosts' work,  Pink Tiger  brims with youthful reminiscences and often finds him searching for home. Riding a coast-cool, groove, ""Island Kids"" encapsulates this spirit and yearning. The song's  music video  was filmed on Protection Island, which holds a special place in Teacher's heart. The song, he says, is an elegy to a halcyon type of childhood that feels increasingly less common.      Dashed hopes and unrealized ambitions run free in Apollo Ghosts' music. The band usually treats them playfully, without so much as a wistful smile, let alone a defeatist attitude, but their approach is more sobering on  Pink 's ""But I'll Be Around Then (Acoustic Version)"" and  Tiger 's ""But I'll Be Around (Electric Version)."" ""Perfect life will make it happen / Haven't seemed to get there yet,"" Amanda sings, taking over lead vocals on the acoustic version while Teacher resumes vocal duties on its electric counterpart. But the duo are hopeful, concluding, ""Peace of mind / Happens all the time.""      Spanning a spectrum of emotions and musical styles,  Pink Tiger  presents Apollo Ghosts in top form. Adrian Teacher has always been a vivid storyteller, but his openness and frankness on  Pink Tiger  is unparalleled by the rest of Apollo Ghosts' discography. Even though they don't hit all their usual revelrous notes, they've stretched their canvas and expanded their palette, adding whole new depth to their already venerated repertoire.

2022-03-08,Riley Wallace,5,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Kanye West's 'Donda 2' Isn't Finished Yet — but It Might Not Be Fixable,,"In a world where fans have waited nearly five years for a follow-up to Kendrick Lamar's Pulitzer Prize-winning  DAMN.  or close to two decades for an André 3000 solo effort, there was something oddly freeing about the rollout of  Kanye West 's  Donda  sequel.    Barely letting the dust settle after its chart-topping predecessor,  V2.22.22 MIAMI  — the current release of the album otherwise known as  Donda 2  — is a noticeably unfinished album. It's  only officially available on Ye's own Stem Player device , where listeners can manipulate the tracks to their liking. This makes fans a part of Ye's creative process — an engaging idea in theory, even if the the Stem Player's $200 USD price point is quite steep for the average listener. The Stem Player itself is an innovative creative product, another example of Ye's trailblazing — the music on  Donda 2  is less so.    As it currently stands,  Donda 2  is very much a reflection of Ye's mindset as expressed in his recent online exploits, largely inspired by his divorce from Kim Kardashian. He is far from the first man to be engrossed in a separation that involves children. Still, he is arguably the most popular, and he continues to use his platform to lob uncomfortably  one-sided jabs at Kardashian and her new boyfriend, Pete Davidson . While his heart may be in the right place (in his mind), the messaging gets more than a little mixed up as the tracklist progresses, not unlike the Instagram post-and-delete madness we got leading up to the album.    For example, on ""True Love,"" featuring the late  XXXTentacion , Ye takes shots at Kardashian and laments the emotional, frustrating realities of co-parenting under hostility (something he's, y'know, contributing toward). It's a sharp juxtaposition to a much more menacing ""Security,"" where he appears to be threatening the safety of anyone standing between him and the nuclear family structure he's trying to regain. It's hard not to see this directed at Davidson, who has become one of the most prominent opps of Ye's career, up there with Taylor Swift and big tech. It's an incredibly harsh song to have out in the world during a divorce proceeding.    Then, even more jarring, is ""Flowers,"" which can be taken two ways. While the chorus feels like a reference to the extravagant Valentine's Day gift Ye sent Kardashian, he appears to be addressing a new acquaintance — assuring her that he is the literal pinnacle she will ever reach. That's quite off-brand, considering the bulk of  Donda 2 's crux and his personal narrative of late.    Not that the album is unfinished to the point it's entirely unsatisfying; there are clear winners here. Kanye bares his soul against Don Toliver's angelic vocals on ""Broken Road,"" and Vory's feature on ""Lord Lift Me Up"" gives an unmistakably orchestral feel. ""We Did It,"" featuring  Migos  and  Baby Keem , is a rare bright moment in what feels like an otherwise dark tracklist, standing as a clear highlight on the album, while NYC ode ""City of Gods"" stands as the most fully realized track. As usual, his curation of guests is vital, at points carrying Ye's incomplete verses (which are often hampered by mumbly placeholders). The  Future -featuring ""Keep It Burning"" and  Jack Harlow -aided ""Louie Bags"" both feel like potentially great tracks that weren't ready to come out of the oven yet.    The first instalment of  Donda  used elements of Ye's late mother's voice to help stitch together a thematic narrative, and that sense of tribute gets lost in the sequel. Instead, he's submerged in his divorce. On ""Sci-Fi,"" he samples Kardashian's vocals and recalls ""[giving her] the semen"" before asking her to choose between oxygen or Wi-Fi— while also stating that he's recusing himself (from a public situation he is in fact driving) for his own sanity. He follows that up with ""Selfish,"" a song that sees him reassert his newfound musical independence while again harkening back to the sense of loneliness he is currently feeling.    It's possibly his most focused tracklist in recent memory; it's a voyeuristic look into a dark period in his timeline. Ye isn't happy — he says it himself more than once. The result is timely music that, for better or worse, captures this moment, despite not having any real high-powered hits or us being mixed and mastered to the level of his most revered work.    It does open up a new world, allowing fans access to clean stems. This could result in better remixes and mashups from a wide variety of listeners — whether it's producers building around the existing elements or artists adding their verses to glaring gaps in songs like ""True Love"" or ""Too Easy.""     Even in the eyes of his die-hard fans, this feels like an accurate indicator of a project that will ultimately play in the same sandbox, albeit with some changed instrumentation and — hopefully — fleshed out songs. Dark times often lead to fantastic art. However, for Ye, the intersection of striking while the iron's hot has resulted in a rushed body of work. Things are happening in real-time — for example,  his March 5 ""divorce"" post , with a caption including lines like, ""Divorce feels like your kids were snatched from your control / Divorce feels like you've been shot and traffic is slow,"" which feels like an inevitable future addition to this project. But, whether tinkering can add some sorely missing replay value to  Donda 2  remains to be seen.

2022-03-10,Kaelen Bell,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Jenny Hval Deconstructs the Myth of Creation on 'Classic Objects',,"""Look at these trees / Look at this grass / Look at those clouds,"" intoned the Observatory's Vivian Wang at the outset of  Jenny Hval 's 2019 record  The Practice of Love . She continued, surveying a moist, minuscule universe of mushrooms and small blue flowers: ""Study this and ask yourself / Where is God?""     ""Cemetery of Splendour"" — the clicking, chirruping centrepiece of  Hval's latest record,  Classic Objects  — finds the Norwegian avant-pop sorcerer in a similar state of wonderment. ""Trees, stick, rocks / Bamboo leaf / Bamboo leaf again / Then the branch / The branch / The pinecone!"" she says giddily, a smile stretching her words like taffy. ""And the birds, in the distance / Gum, gum, gum! / Cigarette butts / Candy wrapper / A button.""     Gone is Wang's cool stoicism, Hval's gentle cadence recalling the joyous freedom of Life Without Buildings' Sue Tompkins. Gone, too, is the solitude of Wang's observation; her sombre curiosity at the holy absence of human intrusion. Surrounded by bodily imprints and interloping garbage, Hval revels in the currents of human movement at a place reserved for the departed. ""Shoes came here / And here / And here / Someone once laid down here"" — though she stands in a courtyard of death, all she sees is life.    Hval's work has never shied from humanity and the pulse of living. Her albums peer, often and unafraid, into the wet depths of the body and brain. But the intimate humanity of  Classic Objects  feels like something else. Warm, loose and occupied by the realities of creative work and the contradictory comfort of our ""normcore institutions,"" it manages to be Hval's most accessible record yet. It fearlessly holds her seemingly divergent identities — artist and worker, partner and provocateur, realist and dreamer — beneath the same glittering disco ball.    The jubilant graveyard walk of ""Cemetery of Splendour"" encapsulates the tone — both musically and thematically — of  Classic Objects  as a whole. Hval has never stayed in one lane for long, and  Classic Objects  finds her eschewing the trance-indebted throb of  The Practice of Love  for percussive, guitar-and-keys led pop music. There are traces of  Graceland 's rhythmic jamboree and Talk Talk's patient quietude, but Hval's unmistakable voice and inimitable melodies make comparisons feel more or less obsolete. The album shimmers and floats with a wide-eyed delight, as though Hval and her players are performing several feet above the ground. The blue sky of the album's artwork is an obvious touchstone for its sonic world.    The patchwork diorama positioned below that sky is integral too — beneath a monument of clarity and freedom sits a piece of physical structure, all seams and glue and human intention.  Classic Objects  is about many things, but it is mostly about the mechanics of creation. Specifically, the labour that churns behind that creation, and the place where work and art and self become inextricable from one another — ""There was a painter / In my first studio space / That I remember / She used to attach / Her own hair / To her paintings,"" Hval sings over the rolling hand drums of the title track.    Amid the cascading harp of ""Freedom,"" Hval pines for ""somewhere where art is free / Not that it ever was."" The song is a prayer of sorts, for a place where expression is genuinely as liberating as it sometimes feels, and where autonomy, creative or otherwise, is never a question — ""When I listen deep / I'm not my owner / Maybe I never was."" In the Zia Anger-directed video for ""Jupiter,"" an overworked, underpaid video crew piles into a hot air balloon, floating in precarity while Hval sings, ""Sometimes art is more real / More evil / Just lonelier / Just so lonely."" The myth of the tortured artist has long been outmoded, but what of the artist as inexhaustible freewheeler? Work is work regardless of the goal, Hval reminds us again and again on  Classic Objects , as she attempts to dismantle the fantastical, biblical whiff that lingers on creation.    Hval's dedication to the unseen — exposing the sweat and scaffolding, the trash nestled in the grass — extends to her own self-creation, as she surveys the cognizant makeup of her life. Over the incessant chime and staccato guitar of opening track ""Year of Love,"" she recounts the story of her self-consciously low-stakes marriage — ""'It's just for contractual reasons,' I explained / Signing the papers"" — before recalling the time a man proposed to a woman in front of her at her own concert. The act instantly deflates the haven of unfamiliarity, the ""multitudes of colours,"" that she was attempting to conjure from stage, and she is incredulous that she's suddenly become a heterosexual proposal soundtrack against her will. But she'd done the same after all, simply stripped of the spectacle and saccharine romance — ""I am giving it my voice / But then again / I already did / Oh, already did,"" she sings as the song surges around her.    The album's crown jewel — dug up, cut and painstakingly buffed — is the irrepressible groove of ""American Coffee,"" where Hval wonders at the places where fate and autonomy commingle to create a life. Who is the other Jenny, the one who chose a different sort of labour, a different set of flavours? ""I wonder who I'd be if I'd never got to go / Get a fine arts degree / And American coffee,"" she sings, holding this other self — the one unafraid to drive, the one so versed in normality — against a backdrop of choral coos, silver-toned organ and burbling percussion.

2022-03-10,Michael Di Gennaro,7,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Alex Cameron Confronts Addiction with Care on 'Oxy Music',,"Australian-born  Alex Cameron  is best described as music's answer to  Danny McBride . Cameron is as much a fiction author as he is a singer, and the majority of his discography consists of vignettes penned from the perspective of the type of men that McBride embodies in his characters, whether it be Kenny Powers or Jesse Gemstone. They're crude, perverted, and constantly trying to cover up their self-loathing with arrogance. Both Cameron and McBride use the satirization of these characters for humour and social commentary, but there's also a sense of empathy in their writing; if they had just make a couple correct decisions and had a strong mentor in their life, things could've turned out different. Yet, their characters never cash in on the opportunities to change for the better, and become increasingly isolated from friends, family, and society as a result.     Isolation is an especially strong theme across Cameron's discography. Whether speaking from a down-and-out character he's formulated or passionately defending sex workers, he clearly sees isolation as a serious ailment, one that can have disastrous psychological consequences. Those ideas translate to  Oxy Music , but the difference is that Cameron seems to be far more sympathetic for his characters this time around.    It's partly because he's no longer talking about the sleaziest, creepiest guy you can think about. Inspired by the homeless addicts he saw while living in New York and Nico Walker's autofictional book  Cherry , the majority of the record sees Cameron playing the role of a drug addict, delving into the ostracism that comes with the abuse of opioids. He sings about being afraid of his parents finding bruises on his arms on ""Hold The Line,"" and tells his lover to leave him if he ever overdoses on ""Breakdown."" When he says. ""there's only room for one in the k-hole,"" it summarizes home his thoughts toward addiction; that it affects everyone around the addict, and the distance it creates between them and their loved ones often creates a vicious cycle that leads them to use drugs even more.     When Cameron isn't talking about drug addiction on  Oxy Music , he's still focused on the topic of isolation. The two songs that open the record, ""Best Life"" and ""Sara Jo,"" speak about a different type of obsession, of being terminally online in the quarantine era. ""Sara Jo"" specifically is one of the best critiques of online culture in recent memory. ""One thing you do, is never fuck with my family,"" Cameron croons, before listing off ways that the internet has done just that. They've told his brother his kids will die from vaccination, a divisive tool of misinformation that has made plenty a family group chat a war zone. They've told his mother she's ugly, and his father that he doesn't need therapy no matter what. It's a different type of isolation than drug addiction, but a self-inflicted isolation nonetheless. In the misinformation era, anyone's confirmation bias can lead to them adopting an aggressive, dogmatic ideology that can range from hateful and dangerous, to simply unpleasant to be around.     Through all of these stories, Cameron is able to stray away from being preachy or judgemental the way he always has: through humor. He's not just a great writer, but an incredibly funny one, and similar to a great stand-up comedian, it makes it easy to listen to what he has to say. ""Cancel Culture"" is a cleverly-named song clearly meant to bait both the people who get excited to dogpile onto anything they deem Roganesque, and the people who are actively seeking out ""woke mob"" criticism — it ends up being a song about cultural appropriation. ""Prescription Refill"" comes off as the typical drug-love metaphor, but he's not talking about cocaine or heroin, and is likening the way his lover brightens their outlook on life to prescribed Transitions lenses. These moments serve to remind the listener that you never really know if Cameron is joking or being serious, if he's communicating his own feelings or those from a character he's dreamed up, and that despite the serious material on the record, he's still making music to have fun.     Cameron's subject matter takes up so much focus on  Oxy Music  that it can be hard to remember the other major part of it, the instrumentation. In a statement released alongside the LP, Cameron contends that his band ""is a band that can hang with any other band, dead or alive."" The arrangement and production on  Oxy Music  certainly backs that up on a technical level: the songs are performed perfectly, each part of a song perfectly in tune with the other. However, the songs do leave something to be desired compared to previous Cameron records. With albums like 2013's  Jumping the Shark  and 2017's  Forced Witness , the strong '80s influence that ran through the instrumentals behind Cameron complimented the characters he was writing: you could imagine them wearing suits with big collars, three or four buttons undone to show a gaudy necklace and an abundance of chest hair. The style of music took on the personality of the protagonist in that they were in their prime when it was most popular. On  Oxy Music , the synthpop and Springsteen worship seems to be more of a comfort-zone choice than anything else. It isn't bad by any stretch, but it doesn't elevate Cameron's performances or the immersion he attempts to create.     The lack of instrumental ambition does not stop  Oxy Music  from being an enjoyable, thought-provoking experience. It is not the first album to tackle the psyche of a drug addict, and it won't be the last. But it is the only album to address the issue from Alex Cameron's unique way of making music, and that alone makes it a worthwhile listen. It forces listeners to humanize addicts of all kinds, to think of the type of support they need in order to simply feel comfortable being around the people they love. With a opioid crisis tearing through the world, music that describes addicts as more than junkies is important. Sharing this is only part of the job: nobody wants to be lectured on how they need to care more about people they may not even know.  Oxy Music 's greatest strength is that it makes the plight of an addict easy to understand and sympathize with, and may even help addicts who tune in feel less alone.

2022-03-11,Alex Hudson,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",The Golden Age of Wrestling's 'Crossface Chicken Wing' Puts a Pop-Friendly Spin on Ambient Music,,"Vancouver songwriter and producer Jeff Cancade is probably best known for the electronic pop he makes as  Devours  — but as  the Golden Age of Wrestling , he (mostly) strips out the vocals and the beats, leaving poignant ambient synthscapes.    His sophomore album with the project,  Crossface Chicken Wing , is quietly beautiful, with pop hooks that emerge from an atmospheric haze of bleary arpeggiators and warped voices. Opening track ""i miss eating big league chew and watching nitro in the basement of your old house"" sets the tone with misty-eyed nostalgia evoked by echoing synth chords and refrain of ""I'm in the prime of my life."" With a kick and a snare, this song could have been a full-blown bubblegum anthem; instead, it's a softly gorgeous meditation on childhood.    Similarly, ""rottweiler"" has an eighth-note synth pulse that resembles an ambient remix of a new wave banger, while late-album standouts ""purgatory for vancouver buzz bands"" and ""koala kisses"" anchor their abstractions with satisfying synth melodies.    While the album is largely instrumental, the track titles offer some hints about the music: ""body shots montage"" is as warped and wobbly as an all-night bender, and the feature appearance from Devours (yes — Cancade makes a cameo on his own album under an alias) adds a hint of pop accessibility to the song's middle section. The hazy arpeggios of ""16mm dream sequence"" are just as wistful as the title promises (albeit a bit spookier).    Occasionally weird and consistently inviting,  Crossface Chicken Wing  is a delicate balance, offering adventurous experimentalism without sacrificing the infectious accessibility Cancade is known for with Devours.

2022-02-17,Myles Tiessen,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Lavender Country's Roots Run Through Past and Present on 'Blackberry Rose',,"Country music is filled with iconography. Whether it be the archetypal wandering cowpoke on the range, rambling outlaw or the city-dwelling sweetheart, it's a genre where typology is as vital to the very essence of the music as any chord progression or lyrical allegory. Luckily for us, in 2022, we have a handful of country icons still kicking around. Arguably, the most relevant and influential for this current country music revival — or should I say  reformation shaped by the Yeehaw Agenda  — is the original queer-country darling Patrick Haggerty, a.k.a.  Lavender Country .    Now,  Blackberry Rose  is not what fans of Haggerty's disciples may be expecting. Those who follow in his footsteps  make country music that is more genre-fluid  than we have ever heard before. One might assume Haggerty would take a step towards modernism to play to the crowd that wants to listen to  Trixie Mattel  or  Orville Peck  but the most compelling aspect while listening to  Blackberry Rose  is that it sounds notably rooted in traditional forms of country music. There are blues numbers, bluegrass tracks, barn burners, and mournful ballads, all of which sound, well, old-school.     Blackberry Rose  isn't a glorification of the past, nor a ham-fisted reminder of country music's golden era. It exists, perfectly, in this decade. Haggerty shows his ability to tether the past to the present, and through his music, he can synthesize the complicated emotional turmoil of humankind. Or, more specifically, that of the queer community that he belongs to.    Haggerty doesn't take long to make this historical framework in which he operates known. He opens  Blackberry Rose  with a re-envisioning of ""I Can't Shake The Stranger Out of You"" that appeared on Lavender Country's 1973 self-titled debut. Like that first release, Haggerty stays political and intentionally remains outside the mainstream country music industry on  Blackberry Rose , shit-talking cops and calling out fascist politicians. In ""Clara Fraser, Clara Fraser,"" he takes on the persona of an antagonist who tries to undermine the acclaimed political organizer. ""Her politics ain't ladylike / I just can't stand her abrasive behaviour,"" sings the narrator over the whimsical, upbeat jig.    One of the most fun and playful songs is the smoky and musky ""Gay Bar Blues."" Haggerty expertly sets the scene, and you can perfectly imagine the rural honky-tonk dive bar in which the song exists. ""If I don't hook a dude, I'm gonna drown in wine coolers / I got the gay bar blues,"" sings Haggerty before the song breaks into a fierce fiddle solo working in tandem with a grungy guitar.    Country music is a genre of shared stories, and through the lending of lyrics, arrangements, and melodies, we find consolation in our solitude. Haggerty expresses this in a rather unique and humorous way in his reworking of Tammy Wynette's infamous ""Stand By Your Man."" Among certain interpretations, Wynette's song values a woman's uncritical submission to her husband regardless of transgression. But on  Blackberry Rose , it has been transformed into ""Stand On Your Man,"" and Haggerty, along with Nikki Grossman, takes Wynette's enduring melody and mutates the song into their own dynamic narrative about self-actualization and gender role reversal. ""If he gets sassy, you might have to kick his ass until he learns to jump at your command,"" Grossman sings confidently. It's the type of cheeky homage to country music history that Lavender Country did so well on their eponymous record almost 50 years ago.    Haggerty's political disposition may lean into the comical, but on the song ""Blackberry Rose,"" he uses a somber tone and his acute lyrical ability to tell the story of the lynching of a Black man who fell in love and started a family with a white woman in the early 1900s. In the ballad, Haggerty describes their relationship as ""The finest and tenderest you could ever find in humankind."" Ultimately, the white folks in the community tear the lovers apart, killing the Black man and the child. The narrative is reminiscent of Bob Dylan's ""Hattie Carroll,"" and uses historical truths to bring awareness to contemporary injustices.    And baby, in times like these, the world can be thankful for more music from Lavender Country.

2022-02-17,Alan Ranta,8,"EP,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Khruangbin and Leon Bridges' Southern Charm Never Wanes on 'Texas Moon',,"Texas is arguably best known for country music, but the Lone Star State has produced major contributors to a kaleidoscope of genres. It's a big state, and they do things big there. Consider the impact Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lightnin' Hopkins had on blues, or that which the Thirteenth Floor Elevators and Red Krayola had on psychedelic rock, or that of the Geto Boys and DJ Screw on hip-hop.  Khruangbin and Leon Bridges  have each added to that rich tapestry as well.      Khruangbin  is the Houston-based trio of Laura Lee, Mark Speer and Donald ""DJ"" Johnson. Lee and Speer got the inspiration to start a band while opening for Bonobo as members of Yppah's touring band. Their name was taken from the Thai word for ""aeroplane,"" and it suits their worldly psychedelic sound. Khruangbin's first three studio albums — 2015's  The Universe Smiles Upon You , 2018's  Con Todo el Mundo  and 2020's  Mordechai  — evoked everything from surf, funk and dub to Spanish, Middle Eastern, Korean, West African and Thai music.  Mordechai  was a top ten charting record in a half-dozen countries, so Khruangbin are literally all over the place.     Originally from Atlanta,  Leon Bridges  subsequently relocated to Fort Worth, and took the world by storm with his 2015 debut  Coming Home . That record's retro-soul was particularly indebted to Sam Cooke, since Cooke appears in almost every piece of text written about it (including this). He opened his R&B style up a bit more with 2018's  Good Thing , hosting hints of funk, disco, pop and hip-hop more in line with Prince and Ginuwine, while 2021's  Gold-Diggers Sound  refined more Afrobeat, jazz and, indeed, country vibes during a series of midnight jam sessions in the wake of the George Floyd protests.     At a similar point in their simultaneous ascensions, Khruangbin and Bridges met while touring for their respective sophomore albums in 2018. Though the paths they walked to get there were markedly different as a classic major label soul singer and a mostly-instrumental cosmic indie band, they quickly bonded over their mutual influences from the Texas music scene. Even though  Texas Moon  is only their second EP, following 2020's  Texas Sun , it sounds like they have been playing together all their lives.     Bridges usually works on big studio albums with a lot of producers, tasked to polish his sound in certain ways. With Khruangbin, he is free to just be, and that's how an unforgettable moment like ""B-Side"" happens. ""B-Side"" was actually one of the first songs they collectively worked on in the same room, and it's far too easy to picture the hazy  Get Back  rehearsal setting as they hummed and noodled toward the song's genesis. Instantly intoxicating, the song feels somewhere between upbeat Jimmy Cliff or laidback Kiki Gyan with its prickly strummed guitar, dubby bassline, simmering drums, punctuating organ, daffy percussion and Bridges' buttery, lovelorn orations.     Up to  Con Todo el Mundo , Khruangbin tended to use vocals as more of a textural element, burying harmonies in the mix. Working with a proper lead vocalist inspired them to be more vocally present on  Mordechai , and you can see hints of that growing confidence even between  Texas Sun  and  Moon . Without sounding overworked, ""Doris"" comes off like Isaac Hayes soul-searching in Muscle Shoals Sound Studio at midnight due to its soulful callback chorus, reverb-drenched wah-wah guitar, sparse drums and deeply impactful lyrics about Bridges' dearly departed grandmother.     Every track on  Texas Moon  is a moment of catharsis, delivered with as much swagger as spirituality. Vibing like a Velvet Underground raga with a dab of ""The End"" by the Doors, ""Father Father"" melds a tripping guitar line, lethargic bass line, and meditative vibrations of what sounds like a calm breeze blowing through a wind chime with a plaintive gospel refrain that reminds a broken man of God's love. They draw from all the people, places and things that inspire them, but Khruangbin and Leon Bridges make Texas music, and it's everything.

2022-02-18,Dylan Barnabe,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Tennyson's 'Rot' Is Fresh,,"There is a certain irony in creating your most dynamic music while suffering a hearing condition. That was the reality for  Tennyson , a.k.a. Luke Pretty, as a hearing condition, caused by mould exposure, threatened to derail his first full-length LP. But instead of decay, the aptly named  Rot  achieves quite the opposite. It radiates growth and maturity from the young Canadian, whose journey down the rabbit hole of ear canal issues yields a cohesive album of pop-laced electronic tracks.    Following the critical acclaim of EPs  Different Water  and  Telescope  in 2019, the Edmonton musician steps out from behind his instrumental production to lend vocals to nearly each track. The result is an immediate sense of intimacy, with ballads like ""Torn"" paring down the glitch in favour of a more direct communion with the listener. You get the sense Tennyson spent a lot of time introspecting, and was forced to carry on and find the inner resolve to push forward with his work.    For being a record that clearly deals with intense internal and external turmoil,  Rot  is surprisingly palatable. No track extends much beyond the 4:30 mark, making for digestible and melody-driven songs. There are moments of levity, such as ""Figure Eights,"" but also meditations on overcoming darker days as heard on ""Doors"". The track's nightmarish mood is underlined by staccato vocals and eerie piano melodies, and also by lyrics that discuss sleepless nights and not being able to ""take it anymore."" In this way,  Rot  is very much Tennyson making sense of his reality — perhaps most succinctly captured on ""Iron,"" as he sings, ""Run the riddle back again / Until I understand,"" or on ""Leaves,"" as he croons, ""It feels like it's all over now / But I carry on."" There is resignation, yes, but also determination.     There's an old adage that ""beauty is pain."" Tennyson certainly suffered pain in creating his debut album, but undoubtedly created beauty as well.  Rot  is an impressive first LP, and no doubt speaks to the young musician's promising future.  ( Counter )                           REVIEWS   ALBUM   DANCE AND ELECTRONIC   MUSIC              More Tennyson",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/tennyson_rot_album_review
2022-02-21,Alisha Mughal,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Hamilton Shoegazers Basement Revolver 'Embody' Vulnerability, Resilience and Growth",,"Embody , the second full-length album by Hamilton, ON, shoegazers  Basement Revolver , is a pandemic baby. Forged against the constraining backdrop of numerous lockdowns, and spurred on by personal journeys of growth and self-reckonings that only isolation could kindle, the sophomore record is a stunning distillation of the band's skill and acumen. More than that, though, this record is an astonishing reminder that the unseen explosions taking place within our roiling minds are as worthy of discussion and attention as are the events of our physical reality, for oftentimes these unseen circumstances are more indelible than tributaries in rock.     Embody  is a stellar record that charts a storm of becoming and unbecoming, making a meal of the delicious paradox of lead singer Chrisy Hurn-Morrison's preternatural voice and lyrics vulnerable as a wound housed within raging guitars and soldiering drums (established in their earlier work, this contrast is masterfully developed here). The album documents earth-shattering personal metamorphoses delicately, like a barometer rising.    The pandemic, with its attendant, periodic ebbing and flowing of restrictions, stalled  Embody 's production, causing for the band's studio time to be desultory in 2020, but the album did eventually emerge. Throughout this protracted production process, the band took on a new drummer, Levi Kertesz, and Hurn-Morrison herself received a diagnosis of bulimia, all while watching her now-former church take a stance against the queer community. On the record, these latter two events become subsumed under larger ideas of faith and feeling at-home in oneself; they are reckoned with throughout  Embody , whose lyrics function in a confiding, boldly diaristic way to communicate Hurn-Morrison's inner world. The kindness and the anger both appear in turn, for they are a part of an identity's continual unfolding.    With its controlled industrial clangor and sleepy bass, opener ""Skin"" sets the tone for the album, that of strength among internal chaos  ""Make me feel small / Don't wanna know at all / The shape of my body,"" Hurn-Morrison sings, her voice cracking as if about to weep by the end of the phrase. But she doesn't weep. ""Eraser lines, just markers of the times / Darling, you stand by,"" she goes on, the timbre of her voice having steadied. A lilting piano carries the chorus. This is a song about working to love one's body, but also about the ways in which its sensations lead to bursts of happiness, proving that it's possible to transmute internal darknesses to stability or even power. There is hope, if you're willing to look for it.     There's a folksier tone to this album as compared to the group's earlier work, best evidenced in the persistent twang of ""Blackhole."" The track begins with sounds of a downpour as a guitar echoing the pluck of a banjo comes in, and then Hurn-Morrison's voice, so much like Dolores O'Riordan's, begins. It's a song about loss. ""I've never loved you more / But damn this hurts / Letting him go / Back to the norm,"" she sings, before falling into its chorus, ""Lose control / I have become a black hole."" Every element, from the rain to the weeping piano to the strings to the lyrics and vocals, is complementary, with the strength of its beauty fighting off any inertia.    There's an unrelenting, unexpected optimism carried through the album as it flickers between thundering guitars on one track to delicate piano on another, following a trajectory similar to the ways in which intrusive thoughts work in the mind. Hurn-Morrison fleshes out the album's themes — search for safety within one's skin, how faith can be reconciled with institutional hatred — by listening to her thoughts, giving them space and showing them respect, an act which carries with it a tremendous amount of strength. The track ""Tired"" is more vibrant than you might expect based off its name. ""Breaking my teeth on the glass that they tried to cut me out of,"" she sings as drums begin a steadily driving beat like a march. ""Tired of living like I'm dying / Tired of being the enemy,"" her voice seems to whisper, as she talks to someone unseen about the persistence of her heart and faith despite the unmasked bigotry of sacred institutions. Here, the song becomes a veritable mess of noise, harkening back to the band's earlier hardcore feel.    Every track on this album uniquely demonstrates that there's strength and validity in vulnerability, in bringing to the surface those thoughts and patterns that have been repeating themselves, festering within for a long while. The album has a keen understanding of the effect of Hurn-Morrison's angelic voice against raging sound, and uses it to good measure on various tracks, especially near the end, where tracks like ""Dissolve"" and ""Tunnel Vision"" gesture toward a sunniness after the downpour.    Indeed, the final track ""Long Way"" is closer to country than any other track. Hurn-Morrison sings of change and growth within herself, despite all the judgment from a mirror, despite all the hardships. She tells herself to turn away from her reflection as she sings of love, overcoming fears, of countenancing one's essence. As she sings of the persistence of a body despite piercing gazes, her voice commingled with the cadence of the chorus is breathtaking. The track's end is like a ghostly adieu to recent difficulties.    More than anything, Basement Revolver lead by example through  Embody , showing listeners that uncertainties and confusions and anger and sadnesses are valid and worth soldiering through. This is an album that haunts as it works through trauma and attempts to wash off its murky shadows, ultimately successfully revealing light and hope for the future.  Embody  is a new and worthwhile turn in Basement Revolver's oeuvre, showcasing band members' musical talents and elevating Hurn-Morrison's poetic songwriting.

2022-02-22,Max Heilman,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Body and OAA's 'Enemy of Love' Is an Amorphous Blob of Hellish Cacophony,,"Through countless jarring shifts, sludge metal duo  the Body  have maintained one constant: collaboration. Even on 2021's supposed return to form  I've Seen All I Need to See ,  drummer Lee Bufford and guitarist/vocalist Chip King couldn't resist bringing other musicians into the fold. They've amassed a small army of like-minded weirdos for making all sorts of music, from  industrial hip-hop with Full of Hell  to  neo-folk with Big Brave . By comparison, joining forces with underground electronic producer  OAA  (aka AJ Wilson) seems almost normal. OAA and the Body's respective affinity for sonic aberration makes  Enemy of Love  a suitably hideous, if straightforward, meeting of minds.    The single ""Barren of Joy"" effectively foreshadows the form  Enemy of Love  takes. Wilson stabs through King's suffocating brown noise with jittery synth arpeggios, as he and Bufford try their best to avoid synchronicity while peppering the wall of sound with chaotic percussive salvos. Rounded out by King's unnerving squawks and additional rasps from recurring guest Ben Eberle of the grind/sludge band Sandworm, the excursion proves as immersive as it is unforgiving. Those who heard either artists' 2021 albums will perceive pleasantly familiar echoes within the muck.    The Body have long revelled in subverting their sludge metal roots, making opener ""Devalued"" a fairly standard affair — in spite of its grating feedback layers, primitive drum loops and filthy guitar strains. Blown-out drums and nasty distortion notwithstanding, the song actually shares a healthy respect for quiet with the following ""Pseudocyesis."" Both cuts feature moments of near silence before the mayhem returns with full force, due in part to Wilson acting as both embellisher and leader of the disorienting pandemonium. He intuitively guides the song through transient post-industrial, before contentedly fading into a noise-metal beatdown.     Enemy of Love 's seamless integration of alien electronics and sludge metal boils down to its impenetrable production value. Distinguishing King's demonic goat brays from shrill synth blasts at the end of ""Conspiracy Privilege"" becomes a challenge, and that's a good thing. The album progresses like an amorphous, malleable blob of hellish cacophony, opening the door for ""Hired Regard"" to feed witch house vibes through a McDonald's drive-through speaker. The mutated dance number would be an album standout, if it didn't stop after just over a minute.    Indeed, certain passages from this album come and go before getting a chance to develop. The Body aren't known for complex guitar work, but it's hard to ignore the fact  Enemy of Love  averages at two chords per song. Deeper cuts like ""Ignorant Messiah"" and ""Miserable Freedom"" suffer from this lack of variety, mainly because they don't provide a lot to focus on beyond the monotonous drones and bombshell drums.    The album's highest points centre on OAA warping the Body's sonic signature, like the mutated techno of ""Fortified Tower"" or the multi-layered beats that drive ""Obsessed Luxury."" Chord variation stops mattering when guitar becomes the foundation for the former cut's propulsive, eerie textures or the latter's dirge-like electro-acoustic clamor. In this way, the rattling hi-hats and grimy samples of ""Docile Gift"" close the record with a solid display of OAA's off-the-wall approach augmenting the Body's sonic torment. Wilson even seems to sample King's screams, but who can tell when the sum of the song's parts amounts to a junkyard explosion?    It's a shame Wilson missed out on some chances to throw these arrangements down a deeper rabbit hole, but  Enemy of Love  still comes through with compelling facets of two powerful veins of anti-music. It might not branch off as drastically as the Body's other collaborations, but the album remains a distinct iteration of the band's truly strange voice in underground music.

2022-02-23,Chris Bryson,7,"AMBIENT,METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Blood Incantation Space Out on 'Timewave Zero',,"On their first two full-lengths,  Blood Incantation  crafted cosmic death metal that launched them to the exosphere. Their journey — on the fringes of metal, tethered between death and beyond — was given extra thrust by the success of 2019's  Hidden History of the Human Race ,  which earned major accolades and marked them as an act to watch. For their new record,  Timewave Zero , the Denver quartet departed on a decidedly different musical trajectory, dropping the metal of yore to explore the vastness and zero gravity of outer space.     The intent was to lean into the experimental, psychedelic and progressive elements of their music while exploring their dark, cosmic and cinematic tendencies even further, and  Timewave Zero  is a sprawling galactic odyssey. The LP unfolds across two near twenty-minute tracks, scanning serenity to requiem and the gulfs in between.     A pulse draws the listener into song one, ""Io."" It builds gradually until a massive drone appears with faint metallic squeaks. Then, it intensifies, with layers of rippling tones and mysterious clatter. It's distinctly sci-fi. Notes bubble, stretch and are cast into the ether. Sound signals emit into shimmering nothingness. Around the eight-minute mark, a synth starts flowing through a recurring motif shrouded in dark, swelling ambience as silvery ribbons float like shooting stars in the distance. As that motif falls away, the immenseness returns, and with it a groaning drone and guitar that grow to be funereal, foreboding and hypnotic. By the time the sequence transitions into the song's rumbling, softly twanging coda, the listener is lost far in Blood Incantation's orbit.     ""Ea"" picks up in similar territory. Synths send arpeggiating pulses and beams of light into humming, twinkling space. The piece evolves slowly and subtly, always staying within a moderate scope which, for these excursions' expansiveness, somewhat limits their allure. Nevertheless,  Timewave Zero  is a scenic and mournful drift through cold and emotive cosmos. Around the midpoint of ""Ea,"" an elegiac and haunting guitar riff makes a distinct appearance, joined by sparkling squelches, brooding bass and subdued wails. The track continues as this refrain dissolves into forlorn bellows and ebbing rays, moving further into the deep, dark unknown.     Blood Incantation's shift into ambience is an admirable one, especially following an effort as lauded as  Hidden History of the Human Race . While  Timewave Zero  finds the band adapting well to this shadowy fantasia, one can't help but feel now that Blood Incantation has set the lay of the galaxy, there is more to explore. Whether the results are visceral or cerebral, of inner consciousness or outer space, these guys are well-equipped for the ride.

2022-02-23,Vish Khanna,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Superchunk Wage War Against 'Wild Loneliness' with Infectious Sweetness,,"In all the grimy gloom of a pandemic, we need  Superchunk  to drop by and blast it all away with a wondrously upbeat and slyly optimistic record that shows off their spirited sophistication, as one of the best pop-rock bands (still) going. Augmented with horns, including Kelly Pratt on trumpet and Wye Oak's Andy Stack on saxophone, and strings helmed by Owen Pallett,  Wild Loneliness  wars against despair, armed to the teeth with infectious sweetness.     With songs written before and during the pandemic,  Wild Loneliness  bears the distinction of being eerily prescient and emotionally reactive to whatever raw uncertainty all of us were enduring on many — if not most — days between 2020 and now. The tension of ""City of the Dead,"" which feels borne of our various pandemic-induced pauses, lies in its sense that there is something looming from the second it begins and then continues to build, as Mac McCaughan phrases his vocals haltingly, leaving us hanging after each thoughtful stanza, and singing of a haunted normalcy most of us are still negotiating each day.     ""Endless Summer"" might be of the same time and crisis, but it's not. Here, the band take on climate change with one of the most artful pop anthems in a Superchunk catalogue that already contains several storage units full of such things. Backed up by Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake and Raymond McGinley on vocals, this song's legitimately and viscerally refreshing; it's so propulsive a call to action, it generates true hope that something can be done about global warming and ecological collapse — and it's only a catchy-ass song, really.     There are occasions on tracks like, say, ""Highly Suspect,"" where the horns blare and Jon Wurster adds a hiccup to his kick pattern, that find Superchunk at their most fearless. Familiar textural flourishes and a blend of distortion and acoustic guitars will certainly soothe old faithfuls, but there are some surprises too, like McCaughan's gorgeous vocal turn on ""Set It Aside"" — his vocal command has never sounded so rich. His sense of purpose and reassurance on ""On the Floor,"" a huge pop song featuring the sturdy lock-step of bassist Laura Ballance and rhythm guitarist Jim Wilbur, plus back-up vocals by Mike Mills of R.E.M., gives McCaughan the air of a coach rallying his team at halftime, and it's enough to make you think that against all odds, we're all gonna win this thing.    When ""This Night,"" accompanied by Pallett's strings, comes crashing forth, it feels like the kind of sound Bruce Springsteen has been chasing on his most recent contemporary E Street Band records. More than anything else,  Wild Loneliness  recalls Springsteen's post 9/11 return,  The Rising , in that the vibe suggests an intermingling of songs conceived before and after something monumental and life-changing occurred, and yet the ideas co-exist in a landscape where the temporal confusion doesn't preclude the sharing of strange experiences.     The world was hard and shitty before the pandemic and then it got still, and we had time to think about what we were all doing to each other. Some of that reflection brought us together; a lot of it tore us apart. There are moments on Superchunk's inspired and inspiring  Wild Loneliness  where ideas of isolation and connection are pondered and addressed but any despondency is met with righteous hope and a roaring conviction that all is not lost, and goddamn do we need records like these right now.

2022-02-24,Adam Feibel,9,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Gang of Youths' 'angel in realtime' Revels in Relentless Optimism,,"Music about the death of a loved one doesn't usually sound this joyous.    Listen to some of the most acclaimed indie rock records about loss and grief from the last few years — Mount Eerie's  A Crow Looked at Me,  Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds'  Ghosteen,  Sufjan Stevens'  Carrie & Lowell  — and you're in for beautifully devastating meditations on what it means to lose a person you love. That's not the case with  Gang of Youths '  a ngel in realtime . The Australian rock band's third album revolves around singer David Le'aupepe making sense of his life after the death of his father, Teleso ""Tattersall"" Le'aupepe. What unfolds is a captivating story that spans continents, cultures and generations as a son unlocks the mysteries of his father's life and finds answers — and inner peace — in his family tree. Far from mournful,  angel in realtime  is an inspiring, uplifting record that's full of voices, laughter and stories.    This is to be expected from Gang of Youths. Le'aupepe's default response to his personal history of struggle and adversity — a wife with cancer, a divorce, a suicide attempt — has been to channel it into rousing, arena-ready rock 'n' roll music that encourages you to shout and pump your fist over the joy of existence. The band's determined 2015 debut  The Positions  and magnificent 2017 follow-up  Go Farther in Lightness   established them as one of the most impassioned, life-affirming rock bands out there today. Basically, Gang of Youths approach their music as if exercising every fibre of hope, passion and resilience could be potentially life-saving, and that falling short of that standard ought to be considered a cataclysmic failure — and they do so with such sincerity that it's been met with plenty of skepticism (leading one critic to wonder if they're "" too earnest for America "").    Gang of Youths know this. So while  angel in realtime  glows with the same emotional intensity and utmost sincerity, it does cut the "" bogus, rock-y shit "" (Le'aupepe's words) of the band's previous releases. They've replaced it with richer storytelling and an eclectic sound that takes inspiration from contemporary classical, Britpop and drum n' bass, along with contributions from the Auckland Gospel Choir and numerous recordings of choirs from Polynesia and the South Pacific islands (some new and others from the archives of English composer David Fanshawe). Here, the almighty guitar stands down to make way for percussive elements, traditional Indigenous music and even more string arrangements with the addition of violinist and keyboardist Tom Hobden. Together, it makes for a hugely orchestral, euphoric modern rock record that's imbued with the sounds of Le'aupepe and his family's heritage and identity.    The band begins by honouring the memory of Le'aupepe's late father on ""you in everything,"" a beautifully written opener that introduces the record's symphonic, cinematic sound. With unmistakable warmth and emotion in his voice, Le'aupepe goes on to contemplate the reality of moving on without his father's guiding light in his life, all while discovering the things that Tattersall kept hidden — including a previous family back in his home of Samoa — and forming a life-changing connection with his ancestral homeland. The band moves through big, anthemic songs like the bright and sunny ""in the wake of your leave,"" the War on Drugs-esque synth rock of ""the angel of 8th ave.,"" and the soaring melodies of ""the man himself,"" as Le'aupepe moves through the stages of grieving with a mixture of fear, regret and determination.    This relentless optimism persists throughout the album, and there are so many other layers that make  angel in realtime  such a rich and rewarding musical pursuit .  Le'aupepe's sense of humour comes through most loudly on the celebratory-sounding ""returner,"" a song that both sarcastically and self-reflectively questions the role of an artist in a capitalist system. ""the kingdom is within you"" takes the Britpop stylings of Oasis and the Verve and reimagines them with UK garage grooves as Le'aupepe evokes the struggles of Pasifika migrants. ""tend the garden"" fuses psychedelic folk, drum 'n' bass and chillwave as Le'aupepe does his best to piece together his father's decisions and regrets from his fraught history. The centrepiece of that story is ""brothers,"" a loving, tender piano ballad that tells the tale of Tattersall's long-kept secrets and his children's discovery and forgiveness. All of it culminates in an arresting two-part finale named for the athletic triumphs of Diego Maradona; by the time the curtain closes on ""goal of the century,"" there's a good chance it'll bring a tear to your eye.    Musically, lyrically and thematically, there's  so much  packed into this record, yet it doesn't feel overstuffed.  angel in realtime  is full of emotional complexity, cultural exploration and ancestral connection, complete with Le'aupepe's Aussie sense of humour and barbs of sociopolitical commentary. Ultimately, it's a monument to the love that's shared between an adoring parent and their child, and the imprint of that love which endures for a lifetime.    In all of its grandiose storytelling,  angel in realtime  remains just a small step away from a musical theatre production. The characters and settings are written in vivid detail, the narrative is expertly crafted with flashes between past and present, and the music feels predestined for the drama and showmanship of a theatrical stage. Gang of Youths wouldn't dare call it a ""rock opera,"" but it basically is — and a great one, too. Without changing the fundamental spirit that has made them such recognizable (though underappreciated) figures in rock music, they've burst out of the confines of ""rock"" to make something that's legitimately transcendent.  a ngel in realtime  is a profoundly beautiful, meaningful album from a band that has decided that every record might as well be a new magnum opus.

2022-02-24,Louis Pavlakos,6,"HIP-HOP,R&B,SOUL & FUNK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Big K.R.I.T.'s Blossoming Soul Has Thorns on 'Digital Roses Don't Die',,"To date,  Big K.R.I.T.  has been a dependable, if not predictable rapper whose appeals remained evident across his albums and mixtapes. His last album,  K.R.I.T. IZ HERE , didn't exactly reinvent his sound, but it also wasn't an offensively bad release. Enter  Digital Roses Don't Die : the Mississippi artist's attempt at making a neo-soul album, largely abandoning the soundscapes that once defined him.     Gone are the trunk-rattling beats that defined early mixtapes like  Return of 4Eva . Instead, K.R.I.T. dedicates  Digital Roses Don't Die  to love and the shock of ending up with someone who didn't share the same upbringing that he did. ""Southside of the Moon"" chronicles his falling in love with someone born in New York and living in Los Angeles. It's not particularly detailed on his part, barely cracking the two-minute mark, but K.R.I.T. uses the brevity to emphasize that the woman in question is the real focus: ""I ain't mad at 'em if they ain't recognize my face / I still smile in this mansion, thuggin' cause I get around / All eyes on you when you in town.""     If nothing else,  Digital Roses Don't Die  is the most heartfelt K.R.I.T. has been since 2017 double album  4eva Is A Mighty Long Time . Though the tracks don't always delve deep into the rapper's psyche, there are moments of true self-reflection. ""Generational - Weighed Down"" sees K.R.I.T. reflect on his insecurities, expressing concern over being a parent and developing addictive habits: ""What if I ain't meant to be a parent? / What if I'm a lost soul damaged? / What if I can't slow down the throttle? / What if I can't put down the bottle?"" Further reflection is found in songs like ""It's Over Now"" and ""Would It Matter?,"" but fail to add more depth to the artist's ethos.     While more conceptual than his previous album,  Digital Roses Don't Die  suffers from a minor identity crisis. Four interludes, named for the four classical elements of nature, none of them seem to separate the feelings of the album. ""Fire (Interlude)"" is supposed to act as a fiery opener about passion, but fails to set the tone of the next four tracks until the next interlude. Their inclusion feels more like a forced concept than a distinct separation of the album's varying moods.     Despite ditching the southern rap tropes in his aesthetic switch, Big K.R.I.T.'s efforts to make a neo-soul album mostly work. He has a lovely singing voice and an excellent ear for beats, but doesn't always hit the mark. Lacking the depth of his more memorable efforts,  Digital Roses Don't Die  sounds more like an album Big K.R.I.T. made for himself rather than something he expected his fans to collectively laud.

2022-02-25,Luke Fox,8,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",'God Don't Make Mistakes' When It Comes to Conway the Machine's Captivating Voice,,"The first guest voice you hear on  God Don't Make Mistakes,   Conway the Machine 's long-awaited major label debut, speaks volumes about where the rapper is coming from — and the lane he's striving to plow through. A raspy  Beanie Sigel  barks through the gloomy drugs-and-guns opener ""Lock Load."" The Broad Street Bully famously gave  JAY-Z 's Roc-A-Fella empire even more street cred. Since his wild heyday, Beanie's voice has changed. Wounded in a 2014 drive-by shooting, Sigel was rushed to the hospital. A removed lung left his voice hindered.     Conway, too, has had health struggles affect his rap flow. Shot in the neck and shoulder in 2012, the bullets left him with Bell's Palsy that paralyzed the right side of his face, sending him into mental spiral. So, when Conway (or Sigel, for that matter) dives into the unseemly traps of street life – greed, paranoia, violence, desperation, self-reliance – the listener isn't questioning bona fides. A blurted threat like, ""I'm losing my marbles / Lettin' my AR go,"" carries weight because you can envision the man snapping for real.     What's great about Conway — and what's splattered all over his decidedly non-commercial commercial debut   — is that the corner boasts come parcelled with introspection, regret and growth. The 39-year-old  Griselda Records  star has moved past his past, and yet, will forever be highly informed by the Buffalo, NY, struggle that shaped him.     Although  GDMM 's guest list sounds expensive ( Lil Wayne ,  Rick Ross ,  T.I. ,  Jill Scott ) and the production credits are A-plus ( t he Alchemist , Daringer,  J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League ,  Hit-Boy , Bink!, Cosmo),  Conway's choice in beats hasn't wavered one iota since his mixtape days. Dark and brooding, this is a record built for a brutal winter in Upstate New York; for dudes who can't afford AirPods, but are rocking a hand-me-down bubblegoose while trudging along a snowy sidewalk.     Conway shares mic time with his old mates,  Benny the Butcher  and  Westside Gunn , on the gloriously grimy ""John Woo Flick,"" and his own proteges,  Jae Skeese and 7xve, on ""Drumwork."" Despite his eagerness to be inclusive, the marquee artist's persona hogs this set.    Credit Conway for cranking out a smartly written collection of street rap and not stretching too far out of his zone just because he's now on  Eminem 's label. In other words,  God Don't Make Mistakes  avoids the mistakes some of Slim Shady's other find-and-signs have fallen victim to. That's due to an ear for dope beats in his wheelhouse and a willingness to, occasionally, get thug emo. To sometimes ignore the advice of an OG (""Keep those feelings in your chest / Just kill 'em with your success"") and let us in to a pain that can resort to inflicting it.     Whether getting confessional about his come-up (""Wild Chapter""), wrestling with relationships (""Piano Love""), recounting his near-death experience with rawness (""Guilty""), or flat-out admitting to depression, alcoholism and familial suicide (""Stressed"") Conway's voice bleeds throughout this star-studded affair — damaged as it is.

2022-02-28,Luke Fox,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",EarthGang Commune with Ghosts and Greatness on 'Ghetto Gods',,"Ghosts can, at once, haunt and inspire; they can loom tragic and stir ideas.      EarthGang 's brilliant if uneven  Ghetto Gods  is heavily linked to the open-minded duo's heroes, most of whom have passed yet swirl wholly present for Olu and WowGr8's deep mediations and flighty escapes.    So, when guest emcee and fellow Dreamville threat JID hops on the bouncy posse cut ""Waterboyz"" and spits, ""I see the evil is in disguise / All of my idols already died,"" you have to wonder if he heard his pals' entire album and was summing it up in one hot line.    EarthGang continually strive to ground the heavenly to the earthly, and vice versa. There are mentions of attacking life with a ""Mamba mentality"" (in reference to Kobe Bryant), binging on Nipsey Hussle verses, and rocking boats like Aaliyah.     Bittersweet single ""All Eyes on Me"" is, fittingly, precisely the type of chest-pounding, semi-spiritual anthem Tupac Shakur would make if he were still alive and raging against today's machine. The bud-burning break ""Smoke Sum"" was lit as a coping strategy during their home city's George Floyd protests, and it simmers with high-test Bob Marley vibes. (Heck, even promo single ""Aretha"" — not included in the studio's finished product, sadly — is a sweet ode to Ms. Franklin.)    ""Warriors die, but they live in the sky,"" WowGr8 raps at one point, grasping skyward from Atlanta, GA.    Spiritual overtones and seeds of legacy drape the proceedings on  Ghetto Gods , which wants its listener to shed the lies and fakery, to let their inner light shine. Of course, its authors' writing is too smart and their skills too dexterous to allow this message to come off as corny. The risk-taking production, overseen by Kawan ""KP"" Prather of Dungeon Family, leans into their home state's swamp-thick hip-hop history.    The four-song run of ""Waterboyz,"" ""Amen,"" ""All Eyes on Me"" and ""Lie to Me"" — a moral story rap so soaked in P-funk, I waited for George Clinton to pop up and talk smack about a mothership or electo-booties or something — is as clean and fun as anything in EarthGang's catalogue.     Then we're given some superb if sombre conceptual pieces. ""American Horror Story"" picks at the United States' original sin (sample lyric: ""There goes the neighbourhood / Now they comin' back to take the hood""). And ""Power"" drags Goodie Mob's sing-happy  Cee-Lo Green  back into the rap game.    Still, despite these thunderclaps of clarity, the project's entirety lacks some of the explosive world-building that energized its predecessor, 2019's  Mirrorland . The five skippable skits and a sleepy conclusion bog down the second half of a record that sort of coasts to the finish line. And some of the cameos ( 2 Chainz ,  Future ,  Nick Cannon ) don't add much beyond brand-name cachet.    Whereas  Mirrorland  came from a comparatively calm moment in history,  Ghetto Gods  was created through a plague and a racial reckoning. So, it's understandable that the fun factor and the tempo have been dialled down. Heavy is the pen.    Still, when those heroic ghosts and EarthGang pop in synchronicity, the music is downright out of this world.

2022-02-03,Michael Di Gennaro,8,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Saba Exhibits Musical Passion and Progress on 'Few Good Things',,"Saba 's clear love for rapping, and rap music in general, is felt in his therapeutic, diaristic writing. 2018's  Care For Me  was filled with brutally honest moments in which Saba admitted to being overwhelmed with his own life, distraught with grief after the passing of his cousin, fellow Pivot Gang member John Walt. It's a heartbreaking debut that introduced one of the most impressive MCs of his generation to the world, and made listeners deeply invested in his life and his art.     Those themes of stress and uncertainty carry over to  Few Good Things , but in a different context. The record picks up following the acclaim of  Care For Me , and Saba is now successful and rich, but no closer to feeling the security and comfort that status should bring. Instead, he only has more things to worry about: does he deserve to escape the violence of Chicago's South side more than anyone else that grew up there? How can he ensure he won't end up broke again? What will happen to his relationships with family, friends, and lovers? How can he balance the things he appreciated about his old life — even if he didn't appreciate them at the time — with the perks of his newfound success?     The first half of the album is spent almost exclusively asking these questions. On ""One Way or Every N**** With A Budget"", Saba shares all the new things he's been able to do and buy since making his name in music, while also expressing a subtle worry about how much he's been spending. ""Survivor's Guilt"" has a similarly braggadocious tone, but simultaneously hints at the conflicting feelings of leaving the environment that made him while the people he grew up around continue to live in poverty and danger. These ideas are best summed up in a single line: ""What's really eating when you're from a food desert?"" It's only fitting that G Herbo, perhaps the best rapper alive when it comes to chronicling sobering realities of gang life, is a guest.       Beyond money, the relationships that Saba has fostered have clearly changed since he blew up, and much of the album's middle portion deals with the rifts his new life has created between him and the people he loves. He reasons with his woman on the Smino and 6LACK-assisted ""Still,"" and on ""Soldier,"" uses war as a metaphor for the fear of bringing new life into the world. The proverbial ""soldier"" in the song could represent a number of things: protecting his child and their mother from the harshness of the world, going on tour and leaving his family behind, or even battling with his own psyche in order to be strong and stable for his kid. Throughout all of these songs, there's an underlying feeling that despite his success, Saba may wish that he could go back to before he was Saba; before his cousin passed, before rapping was a career, when life's responsibilities were little more than showing up to homeroom on time.     Despite all of the paranoia that runs through  Few Good Things , the second half of the album reveals it to have a generally happy ending, transforming into a coming-of-age story for a kid whose environment never gave him the chance to truly grow up. The album's back half takes a far more confident, positive outlook on the changes that have occurred in Saba's life, one in which he believes that he does deserve what he's worked so hard for. He's no longer wishing he had his fallen friends back; he's accepting that they have passed, and knows they're smiling down on him. He's finding balance between the connections he had in his old life, and the ones he's making in his newest chapter.     The contrast in philosophies is best shown in the difference between ""Simpler Time"" and penultimate track ""2012."" Where the former finds Saba longing to go back in time to his teen years, his raps on ""2012"" signal that he knows that part of his life is gone, and while he appreciates it and looks back fondly, he's no longer clinging onto it. Though  Few Good Things  is intensely personal, Saba understands that he's not the only person to have ever felt these things, and he communicates his own experiences in a way that invites the listener to share in the emotions that come with them, only making the album more potent.     While the stories told within  Few Good Things  are definitely the focal point of the record, the musicianship that accompanies it matches and at times even exceeds it. Saba appreciates what the music does for him, and he respects it by putting in the amount of work that it deserves. Instrumentals range from soulful maximalism to brute minimalism, while his rapping is as tight as ever, finding precise pockets and balancing old-school rhyme schemes with palatable, new-school flows that allow him to sound smoother over modern production than some of his more lyrically-focused counterparts. It's a combination of the best qualities of the Chicago legends Saba grew up listening to, injected with his own personality and unique, poetic writing.

When they lean into it, they make their best music, too.  Follow the Leader,  from 1998, is a blueprint for the brooding if volatile melange the band began with, while 2018's  The Nothing   was an honest, heavy expression of despondence and grief. Frontman  Jonathan Davis 's wife and mother both passed away before recording that last outing, and his reflection on them remains a focal point of Korn's latest record,  Requiem .    Early singles ""Start the Healing"" and ""Forgotten"" lean into swampy guitars and swap between gentler and harsher vocals — well-trodden territory for Korn, but it's done well, and the reported analog recording process has yielded some of the best-sounding guitars of their career. ""My Confession"" is an absolute barn-burner for fans of detuned, wild headbanging riffs.    Along with well-executed expressions of grief,  Requiem  also leans into some of the band's bad habits. We hear over-produced, heavily overdubbed vocals on almost every chorus, and some half-hearted attempts at big synth hooks. It's hard to swallow the tonal shifts from verse to chorus on this record, and it ends up threatening to sink  Requiem  entirely.    They do, however, save the best for last on closer ""Worst Is on Its Way,"" which includes acoustic guitar, Davis' trademark metal scatting, and some thoughtful keyboards. While the vocals here are easily the best from Davis on the album, regrettably, the lonely bagpipes and sparse arrangements that made Korn's last record so unexpectedly powerful don't show up to save the day.    Maybe it's Korn's penchant for being as heavy and distorted as possible, but the sonic sameness of the record really puts it in stark contrast with their most recent work. Davis seems to bring his best at his most damaged and unhinged, and it's a shame that his band's unrelenting use of pummelling palm-muted guitar leaves him little room for nuance. Guitarist James ""Munky"" Shaffer may have revolutionized the use of detuned, seven-string guitars, but it's the unwillingness to innovate and be dynamic that holds  Requiem  back from being a real impactful journey.    For fans of nu metal and heavy riffs,  Requiem  will not disappoint, but it lacks the sadness that Korn have long tapped into to differentiate themselves from the pack.

The band's imperial phase — that untouchable period where it seems impossible for an artist to make a wrong move, creating music that feels unreasonable, unattainable — started more or less when they did; their robes a rotating jamboree of hole-riddled overalls and repurposed fishing gear, furs and silks disguised as billowing T-shirts.    And now, as is customary of any good imperial phase (and sometimes a harbinger of its end), we get Big Thief's Big Album. The band's releases have previously come in loose pairs — 2017 breakthrough  Capacity  was recorded just seven months after 2016's  Masterpiece , while 2019's one-two punch of sister records  U.F.O.F.  and  Two Hands  cemented the band as a messianic indie tentpole (a pattern furthered by vocalist  Adrianne Lenker 's twin 2020 albums,  songs  and  instrumentals ).  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You , then, feels a bit like Big Thief stitching a would-be pair of beasts into one two-headed calf — or, more accurately, a four-headed calf, the stars above the pasture quadrupled.    The record's 20 songs were captured at four different studios in four different states, each session buffing out a particular facet of the band's jagged little diamond. It's an intriguing premise and a smart way of circumventing Big Album fatigue. And besides, being a Big Thief fan has always meant being a fan of several imagined bands at once, their ""best"" version a constant debate. Do you prefer the quieter, gentler thief? The one that blows the windows out on ""Not""? The slippery celestial invader? Do you miss when Lenker's writing felt more personal and small, or do you thrill when she pulls the universe in?  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You  renders the discrepancies moot. It gathers those myriad faces around the same campfire, the flame a kaleidoscope of colour.    The record is immaculately sequenced, erupting and shrinking precisely when it should for the duration of its 81 minutes. Its spaghetti-at-the-wall approach never feels overwrought or precious, and the initial sonic whiplash of a sequence like ""Change"" to ""Time Escaping"" to ""Spud Infinity"" starts to feel as natural as high-summer weather — patient blues to sun showers, hollow winds to sickly green stormfronts, drunken smoky dusk to balmy black, all in the span of an afternoon. Much like Joanna Newsom's 2010 behemoth  Have One On Me , part of the album's appeal lies in its success as a piece of architecture; an edifice at constant risk of collapsing under its own weight is rendered airborne by a careful and loving curatorial ear.    Drummer  James Krivchenia 's production — aided by contributions from Shawn Everett, Sam Evian, Sam Owens, Dom Monks and a handful of additional players — is as adaptable and dexterous as the music being played, dewy and spectral one moment and dry and stripped the next. Lenker, Krivchenia, bassist Max Oleartchik and guitarist  Buck Meek  (who gets his second Big Thief co-writing credit on ""Certainty"") sound like one spirit, more organism than band.    Crucially, the wildly disparate songs on  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You  feel in conversation rather than competition, linked by the band's near-mythic symbiosis and Lenker's durable writing. Her songs are stretched, knotted and vaporized across the record, buried in instrumentation and effects on ""Time Escaping"" and ""Flower of Blood"" only to be dusted clean, naked as the day on the spellbinding ""The Only Place"" or ""Promise Is a Pendulum."" The band descend into murky trip-hop on the slithering ""Blurred View"" — Oleartchik's fretless bass warping the song's low-end like a torch to plastic — while ""Wake Me Up to Drive"" piles an erratic drum machine and silvery accordion into a piece of rickety, Lightning Dust-adjacent indie pop.      Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You  also marks the official coming-out party for Big Thief the honky-tonk bar band, a new permutation of the group that offers, if you had to choose just one, the record's defining sound. Though they play only about one quarter of the material, the band's country-fried alter-ego is the album's north star; their shaggy songs, accented by Lenker's slightly exaggerated twang, are positioned as guide posts at the record's beginning, middle and end. That subtle structural detail allows the band to range about between the straw-bed rest stops, the barn door swinging open whenever it's time to mosey back home.    These country-indebted songs also make crucial grounding spots for Lenker's writing, their energetic, meat-and-potatoes performance bringing out a warm-hearted simplicity — save for the slapstick delirium of ""Spud Infinity"" — in her lyrics. As Big Thief have grown, so has Lenker's tendency toward abstraction and mysticism, the fantastical spiral of a song like  Capacity 's ""Mary"" becoming the norm rather than the outlier. And while it's a pleasure to hear a songwriter carve out the hieroglyphs of their own peculiar language, the shift from more obviously personal narratives sometimes creates a shade of distance, floating Lenker a few inches above the dirt where she once dug so fiercely.      However, even when she's chasing visions — ""Once again, empty horses / Gallop through the violet door / Follow red, crooked courses / Shadows on the moonlit floor / Oh my stars, winged creatures / Gathering in silken height,"" she sings on the crystalline ""Simulation Swarm"" — there is an unshakeable sense of purpose, a steadfast belief that there's worth in attempting to communicate the incommunicable. How do you say something that's never been said before? You start from scratch.     These subconscious dispatches are an integral part of the band's always-mutating DNA, but Lenker's most affecting songs are often those sung to a human (or even animal) rather than the cosmos. When she sings ""I see you in the yard, drinking a beer / Leaving me undressed like some cheap classic movie / Maybe I'm a little obsessed / Maybe you do use me"" on ""Little Things,"" you'll swear you can feel a bruise blooming on your heart; the humiliation and small grace that comes of loving someone too plainly. And when she warbles, on the fingerpicked ""The Only Place,"" ""When all material scatters / And ashes amplify / The only place that matters / Is by your side,"" you'll be amazed no one had strung those words together so perfectly before.    That  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You 's vast ecosystem can support this multitude of sounds and voices is astonishing. Even more so is the way its greens seem to become greener — its skies more full of stars, its waters clearer  — the more time you spend with it. It's a universe all its own, clarified a bit more with every listen. As Lenker sings on the title track, over a constellation of guitars and wind chimes, ""it's a little bit magic.""

2022-02-08,Chris Bubinas,9,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Voivod Are as Imaginative and Intricate as Ever on 'Synchro Anarchy',,"After 40 years and over a dozen studio albums worth of acclaimed music, most any band could be excused for mailing it in a bit at this stage of their career. Canadian, terrestrial, and intergalactic prog metal legends  Voivod  elect to flex and soar instead, delivering an impressively intricate and delightful effort with their fifteenth studio work,  Synchro Anarchy .    Thematic juxtaposition and contrast provide an underpinning throughout an album that is as relentless as the rhythmic underbelly provided by the captivating drumming of Michel ""Away"" Langevin and riveting bass work of Dominic ""Rocky"" Laroche. Abstract themes of fracturing dimensions, disintegrating realities, tech-fuelled escapism and assimilation, and personal jubilance decaying into cosmic dust are some of the many different angles that listeners may take away from the album.    In this swirling maelstrom of abstract lyrics and instrumental throwdowns, the interpretive opportunities feel as sprawling and expansive as the universe itself.  Synchro Anarchy  is a piece of art that may invoke a different meaning and emotional journey for any individual listener. As any excellent prog album does, it also provides an experience that ducks and pivots in the dimension of time, seeming to palpitate, gasp, and morph its essence across dozens or hundreds of listens, offering near endless rewards.    The opening track ""Paranormalium"" sets the tone, and within the first ten seconds makes it abundantly clear to fans that this is a Voivod album. Lumbering, gargantuan rhythmic punches are attacked by careening guitar riffs before the music evolves into a spacey symphony of impressive instrumental work and distinctive vocals. The track ""Planet Eaters"" is a groovier affair in many respects, resonating to those who have endured the past two years of our planetary plague: ""We all need to spend some time away, from Earth.""    Where Voivod shine brightest on  Synchro Anarchy  is on the album's title track. Arguably the most impressive track of their career to this point, it's an immediately catchy and ferocious piece of musicianship where every member elevates themselves in majestic unison. Here, the work of guitarist Daniel ""Chewy"" Mongrain (as is evident across the entirety of the album) is absolutely jaw-dropping, and helps to paint an interstellar soundscape in which technology and nature are blurred to the point where the listener may have problems discerning whether sounds may be whale song, or a blaring alien klaxon. Denis ""Snake"" Bélanger anchors the instrumental intensity with his distinctive and well suited layer of vocals. Very rarely does prog metal see a track like this that so perfectly produced, so consummate and complex, all while being such an unadulterated joyride.     Synchro Anarchy  offers sonic and thematic nods to the entire spectrum of Voivod's best, previous work and it does so in an imaginative and uncompromising manner. The work is razor sharp, creating a cosmic sounding tempest of tempo shifts and time signature changes that are pouring with intricacy. Perhaps the best compliment that this album could receive is that every spacey second sounds exactly like Voivod.

2022-02-09,Rachel Kelly,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Shamir's 'Heterosexuality' Is Unapologetic,,"For  Shamir 's eighth studio album,  Heterosexuality , the Philadelphia artist directly addresses his queerness for the first time by embracing the most expansive definition of the term — no labels, all bite. If queer acceptance has hit the mainstream,  Heterosexuality  is the leather bar Pride afterparty the straight allies are too scared to attend. In both message and genre, Shamir actively defies categorization, yet he still manages to bare his soul in visceral detail.     Blown-out percussion and guitar à la Nine Inch Nails give the album's overall sound a sense of urgency, as if it were insisting that it must be blasted at top volume. This fiery bedrock supports every track, from humming strings to sparkly synths to cacophonous layers of white noise. Shamir's vocals are otherworldly, careening over the darkness of his tracks before plunging into seduction, despair or both, only to ultimately emerge as an '80s pop falsetto. Somehow, Shamir can invoke Bjork, Prince and the Weeknd, sometimes all in the same track, while still sounding completely unique. The effect is chaotic control; he knows exactly what he wants to say, and he will make sure it is heard.    The 10-track album forms an almost perfect narrative loop. The beginning tracks of the album focus on aggressive nonconformity as a political statement right from the jump; titles like ""Gay Agenda"" and ""Cisgender"" make clear exactly what kind of conversation is being had, and communicate it through an impenetrable wall of sound. They sound like the rallying cry grown out of a life spent demanding the right to exist. With ""Stability,"" Shamir begins to falter, expressing the individual toll of such a fight. He digs deep and unearths traumas, both universal ones and his own unique struggles. On ""Cold Brew"", he sings ""When I'm trying to sleep, my trauma visits me / And reminds me it's all that I've got,"" a succinct explanation of the sense of futility that pervades much of his lyrics.    The latter half of the album moves into a false, saccharine golden hour, the musical equivalent of posting a picture of an idyllic sunset on social media while crying. The tracks are Shamir's version of sweet and sparkly, but the lyrics find helplessness hardening into nihilism. On the last two tracks, Shamir entertains the slightest possibility of hope, the future barely glowing with the seduction that something might actually be better. On ""Reproductive,"" he resigns himself a little, singing, ""Things that give us life makes us question if we can take it anymore / But we put up anyway."" And just like that, life might almost be worth living again, and the fight from the beginning of the album gets taken up once again.    Shamir is economical with this album — not a bar or lyric is wasted, every moment is carefully curated to hit exactly where it needs to. This precision is why the album works so beautifully.  Heterosexuality  captivates and transports the listener, making an ethereal landscape out of dissonance and nihilism. It never repeats itself, it does not stutter, and it absolutely never apologizes.

2022-02-09,Alan Ranta,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",OMBIIGIZI Make Noise with a Purpose on 'Sewn Back Together',,"Nobody lives forever. We only have a brief window to use our voices to influence the world. The debut album from Adam Sturgeon and Daniel Monkman's OMBIIGIZI is all about seizing that moment and using it to speak meaningfully and loudly.    OMBIIGIZI is the Ojibwe term for a loud, noisy or disturbing person. Living up to their name, the band's debut album  Sewn Back Together  has an undeniable presence. Its noise has purpose.    Noted guitarists and songwriters, Sturgeon and Monkman have drawn a fair amount of attention on their own. The buzzing shoegaze of Monkman's  Zoon  made it onto the 2021 Polaris Music Prize short list with  Bleached Wavves , while the sludgy psych of Sturgeon's  Status/Non-Status  (f.k.a.  WHOOP-Szo ) landed on the 2020 long list with  Warrior Down .    Both of those projects explored their personal histories as Anishnaabe artists. A primary theme of  Bleached Waves  was Monkman's path to sobriety, forged through the traditional Anishnaabe healing philosophy the Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers, while Sturgeon put his grandfather on the cover for  Warrior Down . Together, the duo journey further than ever as OMBIIGIZI.    Their first full-length,  Sewn Back Together , was produced in part by  Broken Social Scene 's  Kevin Drew  alongside Nyles Spencer at the Tragically Hip's Bathouse Studio, where they recorded in quick bursts for maximum impact. With a little aid from drummers Eric Lourenço and Drew McLeod, who respectively play in Zoon and Status/Non-Status, the gang jammed out at least a couple of songs every session, and the pace worked. What the record lacks in polish, it makes up for in immediacy.    Even though the duo temper the  moccasin-gaze  distortion and grungy sludge established on their individual works, OMBIIGIZI's debut still sounds quite heavy, as it's indebted to the last few decades of alternative rock. Incendiary instrumental ""Niiyo"" channels the hard-charging indie rock energy of ""Are You Ready"" from the Tragically Hip's  In Violet Light  into love for My Bloody Valentine. Powerful lyrics like ""white picket fences at the cemetery"" from ""Residential Military"" mingle with slacker art-rock swagger to evoke mid-career Sonic Youth.    ""Zaagitoon"" (meaning ""treasure it"") is a floating downtempo dream pop dirge with wistful, Auto-Tune-glitched vocals that almost sound like rushing water — an effect at once technological and elemental. This is similarly contrasted by the emo wailing of survival ballad ""Spirit in Me"" and the folksy spiritual chanting of ""Yaweh,"" or in ""Birch Bark Paper Trails,"" which portrays the patriarchal tension of achieving recognized status amidst At the Drive-In sonics and field recordings of bird calls. These songs are equally at home in lofts or by campfires — wherever people share stories in comfort, to comfort, even if they may be uncomfortable to hear.    With all these styles woven together as part of an essential and ongoing social conversation,  Sewn Back Together  is ultimately a work of healing. With introspective, emotional resonance and formidable guitar tones, OMBIIGIZI's noise cuts through the static, loud and proud.

His signature voice and raunchy style, matched with his expert-level beat selection, allow for his versatility to shine through, while his legend status nets him refreshing featured guests who never overshadow Chainz.    Loosely narrated with scripted hustler talk, the album's 12 tracks are held together by 2 Chainz's aura and voice more so than by melodic progression. The bouncy, BeatKing-produced ""Pop Music"" (featuring an in-form Moneybagg Yo) contrasts with the grimy ""Vlad TV,"" yet 2 Chainz's hypnotic flow and humorous lyrical approach remain the underlying constant. ""Neighbors Know My Name"" will transport listeners back to the snap music era with its glitchy sounds and disjointed melody, while the same deconstructed vibe is felt on opener ""Bet it Back.""    Impressively, Chainz's collaborations feel sincere, a direct reflection of his consistency and the respect he has garnered throughout his years in the game. Rookie superstars 42 Dugg (""Million Dollars Worth of Game"") and  NBA YoungBoy  (""10 Bracelets"") elevate their spitting, while young OGs like  Lil Baby  (""Kingpen Ghostwriter"") and  Lil Durk  (""Lost Kings""), who can be known to phone features in, go the extra mile in delivering quality verses. Unfortunately, ""Outstanding"" is anything but, as it offers jumbled production and an uninspired  Roddy Ricch  hook — a rare dud in this otherwise ironclad selection of songs.    While  Dope Don't Sell Itself  does not inspire immediate playback like Chainz's last outing,  So Help Me God! ,  and doesn't contain the breakout hits of 2017's acclaimed  Pretty Girls Like Trap Music , it is a testament to the rapper's longevity and his vital role in ATL's shifting scene as a gravitational figure for all to aspire to become.

2022-02-15,A. Harmony,7,"SOUL & FUNK,R&B,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Moonchild Place Comfort at the Core of Creation on 'Starfruit',,"Moonchild 's fifth studio effort is a pleasant contradiction. On one hand, the California trio offer comforting sameness: warm, soothing coffee shop soul, anchored by lead singer Amber Navran's trademark feather-light vocals. On the other hand, the group reinvent themselves with new synths, experimental audio effects and the best new addition: artist features. The combination of old and new makes for a fresh sound that still feels cozily familiar.     Like their previous albums, Moonchild keep  Starfruit 's mood even-keeled from beginning to end. The music is heartfelt, yes, but there are no vigorous rises or falls. This is both the album's charm and its main flaw: while its steadiness does make for the perfect lazy Sunday listen, at times the album blurs the line between consistent and stagnant. For better or worse, it's the kind of music that can play in the background without stealing too much attention.     To that effect, no one song on  Starfruit  grabs the spotlight entirely. But there are a few tracks worthy of a repeat, like the gentle, innocent tale of love's beginnings on ""Too Good."" ""By Now"" blends faint whispers of gospel with its motivational claps and uplifting lyrics; Navran animates this track with a spirited vocal performance. ""Last Time"" is hypnotic and unhurried, bringing horn, bass and flute together in a perfect, boozy blend.     The album's features add some dimension to the project and serve as a stretch exercise for Moonchild. Alex Isley's airy voice tucks itself seamlessly on ""You Got One,"" while Navran's delicate harmonies bend themselves around Lalah Hathaway's rich, husky tones on ""Tell Him"".    A lively verse from Snow Hill, NC, spitfire  Rapsody  on ""Love I Need"" serves as  Starfruit 's most energetic moment. With this one, Moonchild liven up their approach to match her pace as a thumping beat and punchy bassline drive the track forward. Cleverly, though, the band leaves tranquil pockets for Navran's delicate melodies to shine.    Feeling good from the first track, and maintaining that pleasantness throughout,  Starfruit  gently pushes Moonchild forward, but not radically enough to disappoint long-time fans.

2022-01-19,Safiya Hopfe,8,"INDUSTRIAL,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Tanya Tagaq Leaves Little Unsaid on 'Tongues',,"Inuk musician, author, painter, activist and mother  Tanya Tagaq  was not raised on the several-thousand-year-old art of throat singing. After moving at the age of five to Ikaluktutiak (Cambridge Bay), an extremely remote town in the northern reaches of Nunavut, Tagaq found herself in a community where assimilation to a Christian English-speaking way of life was an entrenched priority. Although listening to records was a constant during her upbringing, it was not until her 20s that Tagaq began reclaiming this vocal tradition. Much to the bewilderment of her roommates, she began experimenting in the shower. In an eventual fluke, some of Björk's friends heard her improvise at the Great Northern Arts Festival, which she was attending to showcase her visual art. A couple of years later, Tagaq and Björk were touring together and collaborating.    Tagaq's platform grew dramatically when she  took home the 2014 Polaris Music Prize  for  Animism , an uninhibited sonic experiment which wove the earthy tradition of Inuk throat-singing into a tapestry of eerie harmonies and violent rhythms. Since then, the messages embedded in Tagaq's varied artistic expressions have only grown clearer. In her Polaris Gala performance, she sang before a scrolling list of the missing and murdered Indigenous women to whom she had dedicated her album.  Retribution , released in 2016 at a pivotal moment of reckoning across so-called Canada, saw Tagaq sing, scream and whisper about colonialism's inevitable repercussions. In her 2018 novel-memoir  Split Tooth , poetic truth dissolved into mythical horror as she painted a portrait of Indigenous life in the harsh North.    On her latest full-length record, aptly titled  Tongues , Tagaq is more explicit than ever. ""You can't have my tongue,"" she repeats again and again on the title track, emphasizing the resilience of Indigenous voices despite all that has attempted to silence them. ""I don't want your shame,"" she continues. ""It doesn't belong to me."" On ""Colonizer,"" breathy grunts and mutterings of ""Oh, you're guilty"" melt into cacophonous distortions, emulating the rage of the battered earth itself.     Tongues , produced by  Saul Williams  and mixed by  Gonjasufi , employs steady synthetic rhythms and lucid electronic soundscapes to amplify Tagaq's poetic prowess. On ""Teeth Agape"" and ""I Forgive Me,"" she speaks with unflinching clarity — against eerily unembellished backdrops — of the wisdom and agony of survival, sliding subtly in and out of throat singing. In ""Do Not Fear Love,"" a hypnotic ode to the durability of the emotional body despite trauma, ambient humming haunts gnawingly honest prose. Tagaq speaks to her oppressors — ""eat your morals,"" she spits.    But above all, she speaks to and for Indigenous children who have been scarred by the same violence that has scarred her. ""We were entered too young,"" she sings, saying that the past has ""birthed the bricks"" which build her bones. ""They can't protect themselves."" Tagaq's testimonials are raw and soaked in grief, but in every verse of mourning is a reclamation of personal power.    Tagaq's talent as a throat singer and capacity to weave meaning through chaos is as breathtaking as ever. That said,  Tongues  demonstrates that her musical toolkit is only growing with the refinement of her message. In some ways, this means embracing simplicity. If her former work has been marked by the seismic intensity of rage and crisis, Tagaq's latest record encapsulates the power of the pulse heard in the aftermath of the storm. After all, disaster has already struck, and sometimes healing is a quiet process.    When Tagaq swaps swirling pandemonium for crystalline repetition and shoegaze-y ambience, no intensity is lost. The heart of Tagaq's power as an artist is in her voice, and not just due to her mastery of vocal variation. Her enunciation of concise poetry over understated rhythms is an aural experience which transcends the craft of spoken word. As she speaks her truth, she does so without stuttering, hesitating only to come up — deftly and deliberately — for air.     At a time when ""reconciliation"" is the word on so many lips, Tagaq's verses leave no room for settler guilt or empty bureaucratic gestures.  Tongues  zooms in on the ugly details of colonial violence, and makes one thing, above all else, achingly clear: healing is not optional. It is the only way forward.

2022-02-16,Allie Gregory,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Alice Glass Eviscerates Her Past with 'PREY//IV',,"Darkwave veteran  Alice Glass  has re-emerged with  PREY//IV , her debut solo album and first release in five years. The record — a decidedly anti-Ethan Kath body of work and self-described ""culmination of years of literal blood, sweat, sobs, screams and tears"" — is no easy listen, and it shouldn't be. Tackling uneasy topics such as trauma, revenge, domestic and sexual abuse with cathartic reverie, the artist born Margaret Osborn hits back at an abuser she's feared for years with violent jubilation.      As much as  PREY//IV  is a triumph, its topics also inhabit a deeply uncomfortable headspace; the work is near inseparable from the trauma that inspired it, and thus should come with a heavy trigger warning for listeners. Standout single  ""SUFFER AND SWALLOW""  embodies the very evil Osborn endured succinctly, with the artist weaponizing psychologically torturous tactics in its lyrics, flipping and aiming them back at her abuser.      It's an artistic choice the musician leans into throughout the record, which seems to bounce lyrically between direct quotes and descriptions of the heinous acts themselves. ""PINNED BENEATH LIMBS"" is another such example, a song whose words speak to isolation tactics used by perpetrators of abuse: ""Don't talk to your friends / Don't talk to your family / Don't tell anyone / You're not worth believing,"" Glass sings.      Much like Osborn's 2017 EP,  PREY//IV  is nestled somewhere between the aesthetic worlds of fellow Canadians Nicole Dollanganger and Grimes, as well as American counterparts Salem, 100 gecs and HEALTH. The industrial-hyperpop dabbler employs the gothic cawing of crows and comforting purrs of cats on a pair of songs, and elsewhere on the album's 13 tracks, she sprinkles in tasteful doses of static haze, blood-drenched spoken word and trap production. ""BABY TEETH"" in particular is an exploration into darker hyperpop palettes, while ""WITCH HUNT"" and ""SUFFER IN PEACE"" offer glitchier, witch house-derived elements that Osborn inhabits quite naturally.      On the whole,  PREY//IV  expresses a dance-when-you're-sad energy that Glass and Kath never quite achieved with  Crystal Castles , and that Kath and Glass stand-in Edith Frances have yet to capture since the enigmatic former frontwoman's departure. The combined influences of genre showcase an artist coming into her own unified sound, after years of toiling with an identity that could have been stripped from her, had she not been as resilient as she shows herself to be on this debut. If nothing else,  PREY//IV   proves that society has moved past the need for Crystal Castles. Long may Alice Glass reign in their stead.

2022-02-15,Matt Bobkin,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Spoon Try a Little Tenderness on 'Lucifer on the Sofa',,"You could never accuse  Spoon  of chasing trends or flashing in the pan. The Austin rockers have evolved subtly and deliberately over the last three decades, venturing in a straight line through the heart of Southern fried rock 'n' roll swagger since 1996's  Telephono , growing slowly but surely in a laidback, self-assured manner befitting their trademark tousled nonchalance. In any given decade, an artist may rise and fall, but that's how long it took for the seeds of Spoon's psychedelia, planted on 2007's  Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga , to fully bloom as they did on 2017's  Hot Thoughts .    Spoon continue to deal in gradual changes on  Lucifer on the Sofa , their 10th album. Positioned as a comparatively stripped-down, back-to-basics affair, what it loses in texture it adds in newfound vulnerability, following up  Hot Thoughts ' youthful lust with the vulnerability of fresh love, pushing its foregrounded psychedelia into the margins and letting emotions fill the space.    The band's largely no-frills, playfully cool rock music has typically kept feelings at an arm's length, opting for vague abstractions over anything particularly soul-baring. Here, the band aim for the heart, and the resulting tracks are some of their most relatable, direct material. It's apparent from the very first number, a cover of Smog's ""Held"" (which has appeared in Spoon set lists as far back as 2004) in Spoon's business casual style. The words may not be Britt Daniel's, but the iconic Bill Callahanisms sound fitting in his signature scratchy howl: ""For the first time in my life / I let myself be held / Like a big old baby.""    The catharsis seeps into the rest of the album. In contrast to the ""Small Stakes"" Spoon sang about on the opening track to 2002's  Kill the Moonlight ,  Lucifer  succeeds when it embraces the heft of new love, relying on the textures of recent albums to help carry the weight on tracks like ""My Babe,"" ""Astral Jacket"" and ""Satellite."" Sparer arrangements and slower tempos show Spoon embracing vulnerability, relying on charmed storytelling over their typical too-cool-for-school self-assurance. Where safer album cuts like ""Feels Alright,"" ""Wild"" and ""On the Radio"" opt for more-trodden territory, coasting on the strengths of jangling guitar hooks, there's a refreshing vulnerability when Daniel drops the doe-eyed ""You got angels above you / I know I love you more"" on ""Satellite.""    When you have something worth treasuring, that means you have something to lose, and it gives Spoon's moodier, more tense songs a hardened edge. ""The Devil and Mister Jones"" and the title track — in what is surely not a coincidence — are both teeming with devils and other shadowy threats lurking about, with the latter veering straight into foggy, horn-dappled paranoia like the soundtrack to a neo-noir. The endless fight against bad-faith actors has long served as a recurring element in Daniel's lyrics, and the way that they serve as a potent counterpoint to the hope and commitment of the album's more lovelorn tracks elevates the album's world-building, adding storytelling strengths to the mix.    Spoon's deliberate, earnest shifts in sound and subject matter continue to make them one of the more compelling and consistent older-guard rock bands. By pairing their well-honed blues rock temerity with genuine emotional weight, Spoon continue to wring new ideas out of classic sounds without veering into gimmick, staying consistent without getting stale.

2022-02-16,Kaelen Bell,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Beach House's 'Once Twice Melody' Is Not Quite Enough and Just a Bit Too Much,,"Beach House  have managed to build a legendary catalogue of mystifying, awe-inspiring music thats strength lies both in its sameness and its subtle maturation. They perfected the wheel years ago; the thrill has been in hearing them play with its impeccable form, popping on some spinning rims or knocking out spokes as needed.    And so, if we're going by score cards and expected patterns, the massive double album is arriving right on time. The 18-track, 85-minute  Once Twice Melody  is designed, in the grand legacy of major albums from major bands, to be Beach House's crown jewel. It's the record that's meant to gather all the good will and artistic depth they've cultivated in the last decade and change, blowing it up to sky-scraping, Olympic proportions. For the most part, it succeeds.    To say Beach House are incapable of making a bad song would likely be a lie. However, as of this writing, Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally have never released a truly bad song. Even at their most comfortable, the fundamentals of the duo's sound will yield a listenable (beautiful, usually) piece of escapist dreampop. The issue with  Once Twice Melody  is that it tends to confirm this theory.     Once Twice Melody  is not quite enough and just a bit too much. It's not an issue of runtime — there's little doubt that Beach House are entirely capable of making a dynamic, engaging 18-track (or longer) album. It's more so a flaw in sequencing and production choices, a failure to account for the record's overwhelming, distinction-dissolving nature when it's being heard consecutively and not in  the four EP-length dispatches in which it was released . There's also, at times, the difficult-to-shake feeling that the band is on autopilot, as if you've heard these songs before despite their beefier, new-fangled trappings.    The duo self-produced for the first time in their careers, and while the record sounds routinely gorgeous — luxe and lush, colourful and surprisingly confronting — there's a verging-on-obnoxious lack of negative space in the arrangements. Nearly every opportunity for silence is filled with washes of reverb, tides of synth or weeping strings, like air suffocated by pollen. It has the effect of a weighted blanket, a silken heaviness that begins to settle uncomfortably on your bones after more than an hour of gilded maximalism. The album's overwhelming sonic enormity is by design — in  an interview with Apple Music , Scally pointed to the blockbuster opulence of '80s pop and metal, describing how the duo found inspiration in music that ""almost felt gaudy, but it was so intense and powerful."" They certainly embodied that glitter-bomb (maybe more of a paillette-torpedo) heft, taking their already-shimmery music to a place of total, world-swallowing fantasy.    But after the first eight tracks — seven of which stretch beyond four minutes — it just feels like a lot, as if you're listening to a weapons-grade singles collection rather than an album of songs meant to converse with and inform one another. For all the talk of sonic diversity, the songs on  Once Twice Melody  have a strange sameness to them, an immense wave of fluorescent sound that manages to overwhelm the subtle textures that should set them apart.    These qualms (while fundamental to the listening experience) are forgivable, and even sometimes forgettable, when the album works. This is Beach House after all, and the duo's relative stumbles still make for gorgeous and occasionally show-stopping music. ""Pink Funeral,"" ""New Romance,"" ""Superstar"" and ""Only You Know"" can stand tall alongside the band's strongest songs, and the record manages to find some dynamic footing on the second half — ebbing and flowing in a way that the previous 40 minutes does not — despite most of the best tracks belonging to the first.    And though the familiarity with the duo's melodic and instrumental choices is often difficult to shake,  Once Twice Melody  does find them traversing new ground: the guitar-free synthpop of the menacing ""Masquerade"" or spritely ""Hurts to Love"" feel more swift-footed than the churning bangers that precede them, while the gorgeous ""Finale"" finds the duo dismantling their sound and refashioning it into something more sharp and metallic. Still, these experiments can't help but feel like Legrand and Scally pulling back from the twisted majesty of  7 , sanding off some of that record's more dangerous corners.    Beach House songs have rarely been about capturing particulars; Legrand's lyrics are typically impressionistic, abstracted vignettes that aim to capture the wild essence of feeling rather than be bogged down in specifics. But on  Once Twice Melody , Legrand's dreamworld lyrical preoccupations — boys, girls, day, night, stars, diamonds, mirrors, swans, and horizons and lights of all varieties — become frustratingly faceless. There are pockets of illuminating narrative, like the dispatch from the passenger seat on the acoustic, glittering ""Bells,"" but it's hard to shake the feeling that you could play a game of Beach House Mad Libs and come away with the same result.    While the album is epic in scope and regularly beautiful,  Once Twice Melody  feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. A Beach House record is best experienced like a shooting star, thrilling for its relative scarcity and singular propulsion.  Once Twice Melody  feels more like a sunset than a shot of light from the universe's depths — magnificent and enormous, yes, but also familiar.    Here was Beach House's chance to send an asteroid at their patiently-evolving planet, to blow things apart and sculpt something new from the mountains of rubble. Maybe that's too much to expect, and it likely isn't what the majority of Beach House fans would even want. So instead, we get another glittering reassurance of the band's singular presence, another chance to bask in what it is they do so well. There are far worse gifts to be given than consistency.  ( Sub Pop )                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Beach House",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/beach_house_once_twice_melody_album_review
2022-01-20,Paul Dika,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Comeback Kid Relish the Challenge of Moving Forward on 'Heavy Steps',,"Comeback Kid  continue to propel forward. The collective have navigated side projects, lineup changes and a pandemic to boot since their debut album  Turn It Around  came out almost twenty years ago. And while their sound has developed to showcase the versatility in the band's songwriting ability, the heavy hooks and urgency that initially drew fans to the band have always been there. Comeback Kid's latest album,  Heavy Steps , amalgamates those initial strengths with a seasoned approach to songwriting that comes with being a band for nearly two decades.     Following 2017's  Outsider ,  Heavy Steps  is filled with gigantic breakdowns, crunchy palm-muted riffs, and gang vocals that will entice long-time fans of the band. Written and recorded in their former hometown of Winnipeg, the album was produced by John Paul Peters, who also produced  Turn It Around . While certain aspects of the record feel like a return to form, there are far more elements at play than when the band last collaborated with Peters.     Heavy Steps  blends those hardcore techniques with punk sensibilities on songs like ""Face the Fire,"" ""Everything Relates,"" and album closer ""Menacing Weight."" Vocalist Andrew Neufeld flexes his versatility as he flaunts his signature sharp growl in the verses, while delivering more melodic vocals in the chorus .  In addition to the vocals, Jeremy Hiebert and Stu Ross incorporate more guitar leads, and shiny octave chords that provide texture to the songs.     Although the record fuses hardcore and punk (perhaps even a tinge of metalcore) at times, this is still a Comeback Kid album, meaning a good chunk of the eleven songs skew towards hardcore. The opening title track is the perfect example, on which Chase Brenneman's fat and juicy bass lead pairs well with drummer Loren Legare's pounding of the snare, leading to a guitar riff that sets the tone for the rest of the listen.    From there, Comeback Kid build on that foundation with songs like ""Crossed"" (featuring Joe Duplantier of Gojira), ""Shadow of Doubt"", and ""Dead on the Fence"", which features perhaps the most pummelling breakdown on the album. Each of these aforementioned tracks is thrust forward by an underlying energy, intense but measured, never reaching a frenetic point.     Lyrically,  Heavy Steps  focuses on the struggle to keep moving forward in spite of the distractions, challenges and hurdles that stand in the way, which sounds about right for an album written in the middle of a pandemic. ""Shadow of Doubt"" captures that feeling quite blatantly, as yells of ""This doubt hovering over me, overshadowing power"" echo throughout the song. This theme matches the trajectory and mindset of a band focused on persevering through times of uncertainty. On ""Face the Fire,"" Neufeld exclaims, ""A product of change, through a prodding for pain,"" and ""We're still banging that drum, and we'll see what happens'' signalling that, through all the ups and downs, Comeback Kid will keep evolving and persisting.    Cohesive as the themes and lyrics are, a more subtle approach would improve the songs as a whole. Lines like ""Been a while since the enemy shanked us"" on ""No Easy Way Out"" and ""These stabs only hurt me,"" on album closer ""Menacing Weight"" may fit the hardcore aesthetic, but teeter between heavy and corny, distracting from the instrumental strengths that exist within those tracks.     Outside those lyrical missteps,  Heavy Steps  succeeds in capturing the experience and skill cultivated by a band over almost twenty years. Instead of becoming a legacy band, Comeback Kid have made the decision to challenge themselves, and their fans by expanding their sound, and redefining who and what they can be. And if  Heavy Steps  is any indication, the band and their fans will be happy with that decision.

2022-01-20,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Les Louanges Drives His Sound in Many Directions but Doesn't 'Crash',,"The refreshing funkiness and relatable lyrical content of  La nuit est une panthère , the 2018 debut album by Vincent Roberge's  Les Louanges  project, earned the Montrealer critical acclaim, including three Félix Awards (from nine nominations), and a slot on the Polaris Music Prize shortlist. It also jumpstarted high expectations for follow-up  Crash , a 15-song opus which is significantly more serious and narratively driven than its predecessor. Although the candour is not lost, the bubbling melodic innocence is replaced by a faster-paced, new wave-influenced sound.    Despite its narrative confines, Roberge casts a wide net of inspirations throughout the album's tracklist, exploding Les Louanges' sound in many ways.  Crash 's melodies, hooks and vocals drive moodier moments on tracks like ""Bolero"" and ""Encore."" Meanwhile, euphoric guitar strums are often contrasted by stringent synth lines, with a broad spectrum ranging from the feisty ""Cruze"" to the floating ""Pigeons.""    With their raw percussiveness and big bass lines, songs like the pulsating ""Qu'est-ce que tu me fais"" and experimental ""Chaperon"" yearn to be blasted from a big sound system, yet the grandeur is balanced by tender, self-reflective efforts like ""Facile."" As the album progresses, Roberge showcases the breadth of his songwriting ability with the gorgeously stripped-down ""Déziel"" and the pop sensibilities of the title track.    Finally, the aptly titled ""Dernière"" is a fitting conclusion to a dense yet coherent album in which Roberge takes calculated risks.  Crash  is certainly not the road that a musician trying to grow his newly earned fanbase would take. Instead of milking a tried and true formula and emulating past successes, Les Louanges drives off-course and ultimately takes listeners on a wild ride.

2022-01-27,Michael Di Gennaro,6,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,EP,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Jacques Greene's 'Fantasy' Captures the Formless Drift of Lockdown Life,,"When detailing his newest EP,  Fantasy , on  Instagram , Montreal producer and DJ  Jacques Greene  explained that the inspiration behind it was a desire to create a feeling of escapism from the pandemic nightmare the world has been mired in for the last two years. Greene has always been an artist who has produced music with a specific purpose: his early work as part of the early '10s class of bedroom producers looked to innovate by fusing house, techno, R&B and hip-hop; his mid-2010s run of tracks was designed for the clubs he played; and his most recent full-length, 2019's  Dawn Chorus , was created with the idea of soundtracking the part of the night that comes after the parties, festivals and nights on the town are over. Now, Canada is at a point where the nights out dancing and the memories made afterward are gone — a two-year drought that has clearly affected Greene's approach to where and why his music is played.    Part of why Greene has always had success translating his music into nightlife is because of where he lives. He credits Montreal rave godfather Tiga with inspiring his love of electronic music and DJing, and many of his generation's biggest electronic stars — Grimes, Chromeo, A-Trak, Kaytranada — hail from the same city as him. Montreal might be the closest thing to a truly European experience that you can have across all of North America, with its cobblestone historical district, seemingly endless number of cafes and restaurants, and clubs that open at midnight and close near noon. It's for those reasons that Montreal has had a particularly significant cultural struggle with COVID. It is a place defined by eating, drinking and dancing with one another, in a time where all of those activities have become a health risk to the point where they have to be prohibited.     Fantasy  can be seen as Greene's answer to the activities that replaced clubbing in the COVID era. In the same way that looking forward to a night out made the long, gruelling work week seem tolerable, daydreaming about the time when the pandemic is a thing of the past has surely kept many people sane and hopeful since the first shutdown in March 2020. The EP is closer to full-on ambient music than anything Greene has released before, with his aforementioned Instagram post also noting that he was striving to make more formless and ""floating"" songs.    At its best,  Fantasy  accomplishes just that. Opener ""Taurus,"" closer ""Don't Leave"" and centrepiece ""Relay"" all pair Greene's signature airy, sample-heavy loops with light, muted drums. These tracks achieve exactly what ambient music was created to do: compliment day-to-day activities, whether it be working, socializing, exercising or just thinking. It can be argued that Greene's music has always translated nicely for an ambient context, but where  Fantasy  falls short compared to the rest of his discography is that applying formlessness to a sound that is already that atmospheric can push it a bit too far in the background. Even after repeated listens, it can be tough to remember what certain songs sound like.    Compared to the hard-hitters on 2017's  Feel Infinite  and 2018's  Fever Focus , along with the expansive scope of  Dawn Chorus , the lack of fully-formed songs on  Fantasy  may be a disappointment for some listeners. Perhaps that's why Greene felt the need to explain his headspace when making it; though stylistically similar, the listening experience is vastly different from anything else he's ever made.    It may not be the body of work of his that is looked back on as seminal, but  Fantasy  is exactly the type of music that can help alleviate the stress COVID has caused the public, and in that sense, the EP succeeds in fulfilling what it sought to achieve. Greene may look to continue exploring musical formlessness and improve upon the groundwork the project sets, or he may explore completely new directions. The only thing that seems certain is that Jacques Greene will make the music that he knows the people need, whenever they need it.

2022-01-27,Luke Pearson,7,"ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK","Ghostly Kisses Offers Haunting Pop Drama on 'Heaven, Wait'",,"Up-and-coming Quebec City-based artist Margaux Sauvé (working professionally here as  Ghostly Kisses ) has released makes her precocious and often beautiful debut with  Heaven, Wait . Immaculately produced to bring her breathy, up-close vocal right into your ear, there's a lot to like here — especially if tags like ""sophisticated,"" ""avant-garde"" or ""minimalistic"" are wont to auto-fill your search bar. Its high-drama brooding might tip over into art-school preciousness every now and then, but this is quite a solid debut.    The album is divided into roughly two styles: easygoing, progressive-lite tracks that pulse and bubble with crisp 808-style toms and kicks, along with songs that highlight piano, acoustic guitar and string arrangements. Individual taste will guide one's preference here (and there are tracks that straddle both), but memorability seems to favour the former, with the more upbeat rhythms providing a welcome counterpoint to Sauvé's generally sombre chords and mournful vocal style. The softly bouncing ""Heartbeat"" and previously released title track (do yourself a favour and  check out the gorgeous video for this one ) open the album strongly in this mode for instance, setting the bar high.    It's a bit of a disappointment then that the wait for more of the same is so long, with most of the album's middle devoted to more minimalistic acoustic tracks that, while they showcase Sauvé's vocals nicely and have a cold, echoing production all their own, seem less fully realized, getting lost in their swirling Byronic gloom just for the sake of it sometimes (although the Middle Eastern-inspired instrumentation of ""Blackbirds"" stands out). This is made especially apparent when ""Carry Me"" arrives later on and grabs your attention immediately with its subdued Imogen Heap or Everything but the Girl energy, lifting the album to new heights. How this track has been overlooked as a single can only be explained by a desire to showcase  Heaven, Wait 's diversity instead — which isn't necessarily its strength (three co-producers are on hand here, with artists like Birdy and Aurora on their resumes, as well as heavy-hitters St. Vincent and Florence + the Machine).    In any event, it's the start of a strong finish for  Heaven, Wait , with the almost Enya-like vocal on ""Play Dead"" adding a nice, if fleeting, touch, and ""Green Book"" providing an undeniably pretty piano ballad in the penultimate spot. Some added momentum or urgency might be helpful to better shape the melancholy in future, but the same was probably said of early Fiona Apple or Tori Amos. Sauvé treads her artist path well and with purpose.

2022-01-28,Adam Feibel,2,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Our Lady Peace's 'Spiritual Machines II' Is a Clumsy Sequel,,"Sequels are a high-risk, low-reward proposition. How often are they better than the original? How often are they even  as good  as the original? Not very. The road to pop-cultural hell is paved with well-intended reboots, revivals, retrospectives and reunions. Now,  Our Lady Peace 's  Spiritual Machines II  joins a long line of ill-advised sequels, and for fans of arguably the Canadian alt-rockers' most widely praised record, this one might hurt.    Released at the tail end of the year 2000, the original  Spiritual Machines  put forth brainy, high-concept rock at a time when Radiohead had effectively changed the meaning of ""alternative rock"" with  OK Computer  and  Kid A.  Today,  Spiritual Machines  still holds up as a smart, invigorating and emotionally resonant rock record that's poppy, but still a bit gritty.    The album also marked the end of an era for Our Lady Peace, being the last album to fully feature the band's original guitarist Mike Turner, the last to be helmed by longtime producer Arnold Lanni and, until now, the last to feature model Saul Fox on the album cover. The band would go on to adopt a noticeably more mainstream rock sound on 2002's  Gravity  and beyond .    Like its predecessor,  Spiritual Machines II  is inspired by the ideas and predictions of inventor and futurist Raymond Kurzweil. Likewise, it features several spoken excerpts of Kurzweil himself interspersed between the tracks. Several of the songs are tie-ins: ""Future Disease"" is meant to be a segue from the original' album's finale ""The Wonderful Future,"" ""Wish You Well"" serves as a sequel to ""Are You Sad?"" and ""Temporary Healing"" feels like a reprise of ""In Repair."" Original guitarist Turner even has a small role. (Barely a footnote, really. It turns out that Turner contributed the musical backdrop to the minute-long interlude ""RK4.Escape Velocity"" — a holdover from the original  Spiritual Machines  sessions.)    But in sound and spirit,  Spiritual Machines II  is worlds apart. It's not that Our Lady Peace should have made a record that's exactly like the original; artists grow and evolve over time, and an artistically motivated sequel should reflect that. But this tacky pop effort would be a misstep at any time in Our Lady Peace's career — the fact that it's  Spiritual Machines II,  the sequel to one of their most beloved records, only makes matters worse .  Producer Dave Sitek reportedly described the album as "" future rock ,"" while singer  Raine Maida  has called it "" anti-rock ."" These terms would be pretentious and self-indulgent enough already, but when you hear the music they're describing, it makes them look pitifully out of touch with what's on the cutting edge of modern music.  Spiritual Machines II  is the opposite of futuristic — it's accidentally retro in unflattering ways.    ""Future Disease"" takes a stab at dance-rock, but it's far too lethargic for actual dancing. ""Stop Making Stupid People Famous"" is an overly kitschy pop tune that spoils a guest feature by  Pussy Riot 's Nadya Tolokonnikova on a lyrical premise akin to a Facebook meme. ""19 Days"" sounds like Maroon 5 without any of the sex appeal. ""The Message"" takes a cue from the vaguely Middle Eastern sounds of  Naveed  and warps it into funky electro-pop. ""Run"" sounds like a TV commercial for activewear. (All of that said, you have to give credit to the musicianship of bassist Duncan Coutts, who flourishes in his role even in this ill-conceived project.)    These songs take OLP out of the realm of sophisticated alt-rock and into the world of generic pop-rock you mostly hear in shopping malls. You could compare it to something like Muse, the Killers or Franz Ferdinand instead; either way, it's uninventive and dated. The future, apparently, sounds like 2006. If the original  Spiritual Machines  had sounded like Tears for Fears and Duran Duran, it surely would have been roundly rejected.    Some of it almost works.  Spiritual Machines II  is most palatable when the band goes for a sound that's more or less ""Radiohead meets U2."" The quick gear-shifting of ""Simulation"" comes closest to succeeding at their idea of futuristic rock. ""Good Die Young"" is a knotty and complex, yet firmly grounded bit of artsy soft-rock. While it's a bit too sappy, ""Wish You Well"" is a synth-heavy, inspirational rocker that recalls their transitional era of  Healthy in Paranoid Times . The hard-nosed melodies of ""Holes"" could've made for a standout track, but it's far too repetitive to make a real impact.    A sequel to  Spiritual Machines  was a promising concept with the potential to bring back fans who had lost interest over the years. Unfortunately, the result totally backfires as Our Lady Peace grasp for ways to stay in the zeitgeist. In 2000,  Spiritual Machines  found the band at their artistic peak. Two decades later, their eyes are so pointed toward the future that they haven't noticed the present has passed them by.

2022-01-31,Jordan Currie,9,"MARCH 2022 ISSUE,FROM THE MAGAZINE,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Mitski Is Vulnerable and Mysterious in Equal Measure on 'Laurel Hell',,"After  Mitski Miyawaki  completed touring her acclaimed album  Be the Cowboy  in 2019, the singer-songwriter went dark. She deactivated her social media and  announced an indefinite break from music . ""I've been on non-stop tour for over five years,"" she tweeted. ""I haven't had a place to live during this time, & I sense that if I don't step away soon, my self-worth/identity will start depending too much on staying in the game, in the constant churn.""    The abundance of Mitski in 2018 and 2019, from her live shows to her sardonic Twitter personality, had reached a grinding halt. She assured her devoted audience that she wasn't permanently leaving music and this hiatus was only a break. In reality, she revealed in  a 2021  Rolling Stone  profile  that this promise wavered, and she seriously considered quitting music.    ""In order for me to survive in the music industry as it exists, I had to stuff a pillow over my heart and tell it to stop screaming, and be like, 'Shut up, shut up, take it,'"" she said in the profile. ""After a few years of doing that every single day, my heart really did start to go numb and go silent. And the problem with that is that I actually need my heart—my feelings in order to write music. It was this paradox.""    For all the burnout she endured, Mitski channelled it into music, this time setting boundaries from external pressures. The result is her sixth album,  Laurel Hell , a record that dresses up the themes of a standard Mitski song — yearning, belonging, fear, love — in flashy attire, all while oozing vulnerability. Continuing the path that  Be the Cowboy  paved,  Laurel Hell  is composed of vignette-like songs with the sounds of disco and pop taking centre stage.     Early singles capture the musician's exhaustive emotions. On ""Working for the Knife,"" she laments about the drain of working life and mourns what could've been. ""I used to think I'd be done by 20 / Now at 29, the road ahead appears the same,"" she sings. ""Heat Lightning"" is about recognizing your limits and succumbing to something greater than you, set to calming lo-fi beats. ""The Only Heartbreaker"" takes a stark change, an '80s new wave banger akin to A-ha, where Mitski grapples with feeling like she can't pull her weight in a relationship.    Despite the heaviness of the album's early singles, it's the opposite that opens it: ""Valentine, Texas"" is pure tenderness, beginning hushed and solemn before blossoming with liveliness midway through. Mitski is caught in the throes of new love, moulding herself into what she thinks the other person wants. Wanting to turn into a new person is a prominent motif, likely mirroring the uncertainty she felt contemplating her career.     Dance tracks recalling retro pop sensibilities and harrowing lyrics are plentiful. ""Stay Soft"" follows shortly thereafter, serving as a sibling to mega-hit hit ""Nobody."" ""You stay soft, get beaten / Only natural to harden up,"" she says, providing love to someone who isn't willing to give it back, retreating into a shell caused by past wounds as peppy vocals swerve over disco beats. ""Should've Been Me"" is the upbeat love child of ABBA and Wham!, where Mitski apologises for not being what her partner needed, while stadium-sized ""Love Me More"" is the biggest, brightest, most glittery song in Mitski's entire discography, putting her unabashed starvation for affection on full display: ""Love enough to drown it out / Drown it out, drown me out"", she cries. On the bouncy and groovy closer ""That's Our Lamp,"" she reminisces about a fight with a partner.    But following every sweeping gesture is a moment of stillness. On the haunting ""Everyone,"" Mitski ruminates on the existential loop of life: ""Sometimes I think I am free / Until I find I'm back in line again."" Monotonous chords drone on for most of the song — until the last few seconds, where stunning piano trills kick in. ""There's Nothing Left for You"" is a bitter self-release, sombre and airy, disrupted by thrashing cymbals. Mitski lets go of the failed expectations from a lover, but still secretly wishes it was different. ""I Guess"" serves as a bookend — a resolve to this turmoil. She salutes an ex from the shore as they drift away at sea, and she accepts that she lost a part of herself in this connection, but thanks them in spite of everything. The interweaving of these songs is precise, giving the sense of partying and then going home alone to let whatever you've been repressing come to the surface.    Mitski's lack of presence in the public eye usually gets her branded enigmatic and secretive. Except she isn't, really — not in a musical sense, where her poetry bursts with raw truths and desires. In a radio interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, she stated that the album's title refers to the laurel bushes that grow in the Southern Appalachians in the US, where they're just as beautiful as they are isolated. She shows us these qualities of beauty and isolation are often two sides of the same coin, and can be married to uncover the intricate corners of a person's full truth.

2022-02-01,Allie Gregory,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Animal Collective Exit Their Flop Era on 'Time Skiffs',,"Animal Collective  set a high bar with their output in the 2000s, and then undeniably lost steam in the 2010s, a period that coincided with the band splintering off into varying iterations of hit-and-miss solo and multimedia projects. You'd be forgiven if you wrote them off entirely after that. Latest offering  Time Skiffs  — the proper follow-up to 2016's underwhelming  Painting With  — signals that, after all this time, traces remain of the artistically unified unit capable of groundbreaking pop experimentalism.    Returning to their signature twinkling arpeggiated synths on the bulk of the record's nine chunky tracks, the band hearken back to a pre- Merriweather  AnCo era, serving up some of the most accessible and least jarring tunes from the full ensemble since 2009 (save for 2020's  Bridge to Quiet  EP). Picking and choosing their best elements for a distillation of the band's decades-long discography — adding a heavy dose of nostalgia here and there — the pioneering psych-popsters press their freak folk through a chill-out filter, settling into their new phase as less hedonistic, mellowed-out dads, and delivering their best work in years.     Avey Tare 's intermittent yelping, once omnipresent, is traded out for the oft-eccentric vocalist's most subdued singing to date, especially on mid-album trip ""Cherokee,"" a euphoric, cheery wade into welcoming waters. Meanwhile,  Panda Bear 's reverberated, lush vocals (first perfected when he  met the Grim Reaper  back in 2015) are the foundation for  Time Skiffs ' second track ""Car Keys,"" a tune dripping with a brand of melancholy not typically endorsed in Noah Lennox's group work. Elsewhere, Lennox's Beach Boys sensibilities take on a SpongeBob-core quality (in a good way) on ""Strung with Everything.""     Further blending genre, xylophone-led ""Walker"" mixes trip-hop grooviness with more of Panda's Brian Wilson-isms in a fitting tribute to the late Scott Walker; ""Passer-by"" employs  Stardew Valley  organs sounds in a dusty desert haze; ""Royal and Desire"" sounds like a straight-up  Veckatimest  cut; while lead single ""Prester John"" is among the most natural incorporations of a hurdy-gurdy solo ever heard in pop music history. ""We Go Back,"" which dabbles in hyperpop vocal plug-ins, hints that the group are moving into their next era, and aren't necessarily satisfied relegating themselves to becoming a Xennial dad-rock legacy act.    With all the album's nostalgia-serving glory, we would be remiss to ignore the simultaneous resurgence of the ""indie sleaze"" era among the TikTok crowd, a cultural phenomenon that could propel Animal Collective's upswing with  Time Skiffs  into another golden era — if they play their cards right. Fingers crossed they can really up the ante on the next one.

2022-02-01,Alan Ranta,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK",Cate Le Bon Turns Isolation into a Creative Eruption on 'Pompeii',,"Isolation can lead to brilliance or madness, occasionally both. Having moved north of bustling Helsinki to the quiet artist community of Lake Tuusula, Finnish composer Jean Sibelius spent a decade or so struggling to write his eighth symphony before eventually throwing it into his dining room fireplace to ease his troubled mind. Escaping a sense of entrenched mediocrity in North Carolina, Justin Vernon broke up with his girlfriend, holed up in his dad's Wisconsin hunting cabin, and emerged months later with Bon Iver's instantly acclaimed  For Emma, Forever Ago .    Welsh singer-songwriter  Cate Le Bon  took the creative isolation approach to an extreme on this record. She literally sealed herself in the studio on Plantagenet Street in Cardiff, attempting to dissolve her ego, her sense of identity. Armed only with a bass guitar and her wits, she bore the weight of the world on her shoulders, and eventually emerged with the transcendent new experience we have before us, titled  Pompeii .    All the usual suspects are here, though. Longtime collaborator Samur Khouja returned to mix and help produce alongside Le Bon. Stephen Black (Sweet Baboo) and Euan Hinshelwood (Younghusband) slid in their scintillating saxophone from Studiowz in rural Pembrokeshire, while Stella Mozgawa (Warpaint) sent her jazz-laced drumming up from her own quarantine at Golden Retriever Studio in Australia. They kept the team together while in seclusion, the best of both worlds.    Le Bon does pretty much everything else on the record. All the other percussion, guitars, synths and piano, all the songs and arrangements — that is her. She has forged herself into a conduit of musical creativity. As such,  Pompeii  is imbued with the same instantly recognizable presence that enraptured the world on her 2019  Mercury Prize-nominated  fifth album,  Reward .    Gently tilting the perspective towards the bright side of life,  Pompeii  notably features classic synths like the Yamaha DX7. Le Bon used the synth tones intentionally to touch on city pop, a loose style of breezy, funky Japanese yacht rock that peaked in the early '80s. She also channeled the meditative, spiritual aura of a painting by DRINKS collaborator Tim Presley that hung on the wall during recording. Presley's painting was appropriately remade with the likeness of Le Bon for  Pompeii 's own cover art.    The overall effect is ageless yet ephemeral music, nostalgic yet of the now. It captures that prevalent sense of quiet panic and the struggle to retain any sense of time and human connection that has been the default mode of human existence for nearly all of the 2020s to date.    On ""Remembering Me,"" swirling synths, shimmering guitar whine and angelic vocals come together in one of the album's most additive hooks, like a futuristic Laurie Anderson jam with Eurythmics. The sleazy sax line and sci-fi steel drum sound in ""French Boys"" makes it sound like a downtrodden response to ""West End Girls"" by Pet Shop Boys, while the introspective tension and upbeat pluck of  ""Moderation""  sounds like Kate Bush on a good day. Though its lyrics speak of elusive love, lethargic dream-pop ditty ""Running Away"" has a sax crescendo so sexy it evokes George Michael.    With its melodic focus on the bass and heady lyrical vision expressed through quirky pop-tinged aesthetics, the album is full of moments that feel effortless while being thoughtful. Le Bon's serious, surreal poetic illuminations interpret the profound heaviness of our age without being obvious or quaint about it, weighing existential dread with the comforting nature of finality. Altogether,  Pompeii  lands somewhere between  Hejira -era Joni Mitchell and the solo work of Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier — rarified air where Le Bon undoubtedly belongs.

2022-02-02,Eric Hill,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Black Country, New Road Still Soar Above Their Peers on 'Ants from Up There'",,"With last year's  For the First Time , youthful and hypercharged UK septet  Black Country, New Road  rode a wave of accolades that swept them onto numerous year-end Best Of lists. They came on like a gang of high school band kids that chose smoking and red wine over virginity, watching Italian spy movies and trying to figure out how to play Slint covers with added horns and violins. The resulting rush of highly organized chaos earned them a spot of honour amid a rising tide of newly celebrated avant garde British rock bands like Black Midi, Squid and Dry Cleaning.     On follow-up  Ants from Up There , the pent up aggression that gave  For the First Time  its jagged shape has been largely smoothed away to reveal more gently curved, but equally peculiar topographies. Melding disparate obsessions that include the pulsing phases of Steve Reich and the cool rock persona of Billie Eilish,  Ants  trades occasional urgency with a slower uncoiling of its ideas.     Still, the band launches with a bang in the form of ""Chaos Space Marine,"" the album's lead single that boils down world-conquering aspirations and relationship anxiety, forging them into the shape of a  Warhammer 40,000  figurine, sounding a little like a Broadway-ready Arcade Fire tribute. That bloom-and-burst ambition runs through the entire middle of the album with songs opening in swaying balladry and graduating into desperate declaration.     Frontman Isaac Wood — who  announced his departure from the group  days before the album's arrival — probes both left and right brain in his writing, which nicely evades easy classification. There is a subtle, but never directly stated lockdown protocol that informs lyrics of songs like ""Concorde,"" expressing longing for motion and frustrated by unreachable distances and connections. A peculiar ghost of midwestern emo haunts his quavering delivery, especially on songs like ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""The Place Where He Inserted the Blade,"" recalling Bright Eyes in their earliest and most expansively desperate moments.     There is a bit of coasting after the midpoint of the album, but this serves as a calm before massive twin storms. ""Snow Globes"" is an incantation of pulsing guitar notes encircling an ever-approaching blizzard of free drumming that batters its fragile bubble and kinetically matches Wood's repeated refrain of  ""Oh god of weather, Henry knows / Snow globes don't shake on their own."" The album is capped by ""Basketball Shoes,"" a multi-chambered epic that has long lived as a concert centrepiece. Partly liberated from its initial wet dream musings on Charli XCX, it has become a broader confessional on the kind of longing that fills diary pages and requires an explosive finale.    Like many sophomore albums,  Ants from Up There  serves both as a clearing house for leftover ideas from the debut and a tentative next step in Black Country's evolution. Serving both purposes results in an album that doesn't necessarily have the same electrical charge as what came before and would benefit from a little trimming here and there. That said, the band is still inarguably one of the most exciting prospects in new music at the moment, and here, the highs are head and shoulders above the majority of their contemporaries.

2022-02-02,Chris Bryson,8,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,MODERN COMPOSITION,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Jean-Michel Blais Crafts Lush, Life-Affirming Compositions on 'aubades'",,"For  Jean-Michel Blais ,  aubades  is a rebirth. From its opening notes, its whisks listeners away. On the new album from the esteemed post-classical pianist, Blais is in perpetual bloom, moved by life's beauty and nature's song.     Sometimes softly, sometimes momentously, this bloom bears a distinct shift in sound. The Montreal-born musician signed to Arts & Crafts for his 2016  debut LP  Il  for solo piano. 2018's  Dans ma main   found him exploring new territory, combining electronics with classical and a darker motif. The latter was inspired by a section of a poem by an obscure French-Canadian Quebec poet who couldn't live the life he wanted, and was suffering because of it. That feeling permeated  Dans ma main .    With  aubades , Blais continues his penchant for pulling concepts into his music, and even though the new album was composed at times when he was going through his own challenges, it was also an inspired and productive period, and it's felt in its major tonalities and remarkable vitality.     The record's title refers to a Middle Ages dawn serenade about lovers separating at daybreak, and the music lives in this bittersweet goodbye, with the ache and hope of new days, the thrills and fears of uncertainty. Blais still hints at his varied influences, and he collaborated with Alex Weston (a former Philip Glass assistant) while composing the collection, but its distinctive quality comes from his finding inspiration in Renaissance and Middle Ages musical textures — those built for wide-ranging, emotive storytelling — as well as designer, poet and activist William Morris' social-democratic artistic ethic.    Morris' design style seems to have influenced the ornate cover art of  aubades , and what's pictured, along with the aforementioned inspirations, translate into life-affirming compositions, kept dynamic and gripping through Blais' keen technical and melodic pop sensibilities. More than anything else, he continues to push his capabilities and what modern classical music can be while bringing a fresh take on old stories, styles, and serenades.  aubades  also marks Blais' first foray into writing for an ensemble – a 12-person one – and he's clearly been doing his homework.     Instruments were recorded close to the microphones, so not only are their timbres expressive and resonant, but intimate sounds, like the whoosh of a foot pedal, creaks and snaps, conversational fragments and laughter, give the quality of being in the room, feeling the energy come to life, lift off and away. Opening track ""murmures,"" Blais' tribute to Philip Glass, unfolds with arpeggiating keys before being joined by gentle, wistful strings and woodwinds. Flutes eventually enter, uniting in the song's sway, and by its end, the instruments' wavering rhythms and melodies have grown so wonderfully hypnotic and entwined they'll be dancing through heads for days.     In ""passepied,"" a gang of playfully bobbing strings and woodwinds gains boisterous momentum before dropping away to a heady piano sprawl that's soon accompanied by weeping violins and horn flares. The troupe transitions into a reprise with the chipper ensemble singing its heart out, and the melancholic melody harmonizing through the song's latter part showcases remarkable strength with this ability while layering it against a jubilant backdrop. ""nina"" winds through sorrowful tones and odd cadences set in a wondrous, mesmerizing swing, while the staccato blasts and rapid-fire rhythms of ""yanni"" veer towards maximal minimalism.    Then there's the soothing ""if you build it, they will come,"" moving elegantly in lustrous, sweeping measures with flitting plucks, pensive strings and double bass. Blais is skillful and intentional in giving each instrument time to shine, and the collection benefits from this democratic ethos. ""ouessant"" has the vivid, brooding and building high drama of a symphony, while ""flâneur,"" ""carrousel"" and closer ""doux"" find courage in reflective restraint, drawing hope from woes and a community of sympathetic sounds.     During  aubades ' gestation, Blais would go for runs or cycle while listening to its demos, and was moved by the natural world around him. Like Blais sitting in soft light at his piano on  Il , and the fragments of the ways the poet's life could have gone, held delicately in a broken crystalline heart, yet still shining, on  Dans ma main ,  aubades  blossoms like its comforting, colourful, captivating cover, full of lush greens, blues, oranges, yellows, fluttering butterflies and unfolding lives. It's a rebirth to behold.

2021-12-08,Jordan Currie,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Beatrice Deer's 'SHIFTING' Is a Multilingual Merger of Darkness and Light,,"Montreal-based singer-songwriter  Beatrice Deer  understands how to merge opposite worlds to birth a fresh, inventive new one. A blend of modern folk tales with traditional Inuit ones serves as a landscape for her music, where the sounds of classic indie pop and rock are interwoven with Inuit throat singing. On top of this, the half-Inuk, half-Mohawk artist also sings in three languages: English, French and  Inuktitut, at times switching between multiple within one song.  Her approach to bringing these elements together is skillful and graceful on her sixth studio album  SHIFTING , where she explores the emotions surrounding getting older and moving on to another phase of life.     On paper,  SHIFTING  may sound daunting and overly complicated for those who only speak one language, but Deer's ability to craft a seamless flow between her songs and highlight universal themes of transformation and growth can lead any listener to enjoy the journey.  ""Emotionally, spiritually, and physically, the transition towards our authentic selves continues,""  she shared of the album . ""As I shift into the position where I'm meant to be, I want to keep using what I've learned to help others.""      Sonically and thematically, there's a duality to  SHIFTING  that is established early on — part indie rock/pop with harder, experimental elements peppered in, and part tender and docile, like a collection of lullabies. The opening song ""FREE"" is crystal clear and clean, celebrating  being ready to move on from something or someone. What follows is ""UQAUTINNGA,"" a stark contrast with its distorted rock guitar riffs interweaving through a steady percussion, and the sinister and murky ""AANNGIQ,"" where Deer's throat singing lurks in the background, and the chant-like, one-note melody provides a simple slate for interesting textures to play off of. At times, the throat singing even becomes percussion itself, blending into the mix on the edgy, drum-heavy ""SUNAUVVA.""    The aptly named ""ILINUTT - a prayer"" is spiritual and folky, hushed and slow in its presentation and taking its time to open up, like a flower blossoming. On ""HISTORY,"" Deer encourages listeners to let go of whatever is holding them back and proceed towards a brighter future. ""Time to trust yourself, you have to trust yourself"" and ""Leave the past behind, leave the pain behind"" she sings atop reverberating guitars and a bass line that slips around. The closing ""ACCORDION SONG"" is simply that: a minute-long accordion instrumental that sounds more like an interlude than an album finale. It's a somewhat lacklustre ending after the array of intricate sounds thus far, and the penultimate ""CHRISTMAS"" acts more like an 11 o'clock number.      Still,  SHIFTING  is an eclectic, enchanting project that pulls off morphing into different, contrasting sounds while remaining entirely cohesive in execution. It's an album that is as dark and avant-garde as it is light and playful, just like the life that Deer depicts in her music.

2021-12-09, Joseph Leroux,7,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Teen Daze's 'Interior' Embraces the Power (and Production) of House Music ,,"Interior , the newest release from British Columbia's  Teen Daze , finds producer Jamison Isaak succeeding his signature realist ambiance with French house-inspired kicks and bitcrushed samples. It's a danceable deep-dive into some of Isaak's first inspirations, and a demonstration of his mastery of production methods both old-school and contemporary.      With this artistic expansion in mind,  Interior  still  retains the gentle palatability of previous Teen Daze releases.  A decade of globe-trotting and producing ""soft-focus synth pop and romantic electronica"" gradually revealed to Isaak what role Teen Daze plays in his life: ""dream fulfillment."" He describes  Interior  as ""an album of first loves refracted through prisms of wisdom, wounds, and wonder.""    These refractions are rarely more apparent than on lead single ""Swimming"", whose four on the floor beat and sidechained ambience is adorned with skittering electronic chirps. Another standout track , "" Nite Run""   pleasurably disorients the listener in a cloud of finger-tapping samples, until a kick bristling with late-evening energy punches proudly through the mix.      Interior  recalls Teen Daze's 2015 EP  A World Away,  which also draws upon European dance music for inspiration, juxtaposing wide-open synth pads and hopeful arpeggios against 909-reminiscent beats. To its merit,  Interior  feels immediately more robust and multidimensional than that aforementioned effort, showcasing Isaak's growing understanding of the legacy production methods behind iconic house tracks.     The production on  Interior  speaks to Isaak's fascination with the individual sounds that make up his music and the sense of cohesion they can lend. Field recordings of running water, the hiss of hi-hats and white noise, as well as delicate vocal processing unite these tracks with one another.  Joseph Shabason 's ethereal saxophone on album opener ""Last Time In This Place"" sets the stage for the funk-inspired lines on album closer ""Translation"".     While getting back in touch with some of his earliest inspirations may have brought out a more beat-forward side of Isaak's production,  Interior  actually expands upon the width and density indicative of earlier releases in the Teen Daze catalog.    On late-album interlude  ""Still Wandering"", delicious aliasing combs the ear amidst a sheen of vocals processed past intelligibility, before dropping into the  Cecile Believe -assisted  ""2AM (Real Love)."" As the only track on the record to unabashedly lead with its house music influence, this is when  Interior  really expands into that style's celebratory space. ""I feel it coming slowly / like a window gently opening"" sings Believe in a tone-bent undersing, dripping with the coolness of a hot dancefloor.  It is hard not to wish that this energy and sure-footedness had announced itself earlier.       Less about injecting four-on-the-floor dance rhythms into the Teen Daze sound or detouring through them,  Interior  highlights French house as one of the primary reasons for Isaak's transfiguration into Teen Daze, alluding to dance music's much celebrated power as catalyst for personal awakening. Reverse engineering the methods behind the iconic dance genre brings Teen Daze into focus.

2021-12-14,Wesley McLean,7,"ALBUM,HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Rick Ross Revels in His Signature Sound and Style on 'Richer Than I Ever Been',,"Rick Ross  has spent almost twenty years mastering not only his craft, but his character and sound. Album after album, Ross has expanded his catalogue without ever veering away from his signature recipe — instrumentals that feel luxurious, bars bloated with braggadocio, and a sprinkle of anecdotal tales from a drug dealer's diary. As the saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" and if  Richer Than I Ever Been  teaches us anything, it's that Rick Ross ain't broke, and his formula isn't either.     Richer Than I Ever Been  is another solid outing in Ross's catalogue. While it doesn't reach the heights of 2009's  Deeper Than Rap   or 2010's  Teflon Don ,  it shows that Ross hasn't forgotten what made those albums so endearing in the first place. Pair that with his unrivalled and always excellent ear for beats, and it becomes simple to see how Ross has found such comfort, and success, in his creative process.    Barring a few duds here and there, Ross again delivers songs that showcase the best of his abilities, and brings a few friends along for the ride. It's quite impressive that this deep into his career and catalogue, Ross can still pull out a showstopper of a drug rap track like the Benny the Butcher-assisted ""Rapper Estates."" The pair deliver immaculate verses over an extremely cinematic, lavish soundscape, laced with an infectious horn sample and some thudding 808s courtesy of Boi-1da.               The album's biggest highlight is the Bink!-produced ""Warm Words in a Cold World."" Outside of incredible guest spots from Wale and Future, it's a unique sonic entry in Ross's catalogue. On it, he takes an instrumental that sounds completely out of his wheelhouse and crafts a song that fits right into the world he has spent nearly two decades building, crafting standout moment that would easily be a highlight on any of his last few projects.                Richer Than I Ever Been 's tracklist also packs in archetypal Ross tracks, ranging from solid to very good, but there are places where Ross's loyalty to his sound becomes a detriment. In these moments, his reliance on his signature style comes off more as a reluctance to leave his comfort zone, or worse, a retread of something we've heard before.    For example, ""Marathon"" on its own is a pretty good track, but if you're a Ross fan, you've heard him rap over a similar instrumental on Mac Miller's  Faces  cut ""Insomniak,"" where his flow and cadence aren't all that different. Hearing it for the first time, the track comes off a tad uninspired, even if it's mostly due to the recycled sample.               Another moment on here that feels like a rehash of Ross's past work is the title track ""Richer Than I Ever Been,"" which feels like Ross either went into the studio with a checklist of Rossisms to use, or just fed his entire discography to an AI designed to generate its own Rick Ross song. Again, it isn't an inherently bad song, but on a short 12-song album, this one puts an end to an otherwise great stretch of songs from ""Warm Words in a Cold World"" to ""Imperial High.""    Still, these two rather lacklustre moments don't do much to derail how enjoyable this album is. While Ross's loyalty to his signature sound may lead to weaker moments on  Richer Than I Ever Been , it is this familiar foundation that his music is built on that has given him continued success throughout his career. This album won't change anyone's opinion of Rick Ross, but fans will get everything they love about his music: some standout tracks, an abundance of charismatic luxury raps and a slew of incredible, lavish instrumentals for you to cruise around to.

2022-01-04,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,9,"ALBUM,HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Nas Deepens His Legacy by Making 'Magic',,"On Christmas Eve, veteran Queens MC  Nas  dropped his  Magic  project to an unsuspecting audience. If the  Grammy win  and  nomination  for his first two  King's Disease  projects with producer  Hit-Boy  weren't enough to grab listeners' attention, this sublime collection of stellar songs certainly will. Nas spits ""I am 21 years past the 27 club"" on the grimy yet melodic opener ""Speechless,"" confirming his longevity in the game on an album where the themes are timeely but the flow is reminiscent of the Nasty Nas era.    The eternal JAY-Z-versus-Nas debate looms overhead as Nas announces "" KD3  on the way, this just to feed the buzz"" on the soulful ""Ugly."" Indeed, the superb chemistry he showcases with Hit Boy, combined with astute cross-generational social observations like ""Marvin Gaye to Young Dolph, we taking out our brothers,"" indicates that Nas has currently taken the edge over Hova in the Grown Man Rap category.     Magic  also comes with its share of certified bangers, such as the braggadocious ""Meet Joe Black,"" where Nas confidently repeats, ""Your top three, I am not number one, how could you post that?"" in the infectious hook. The song's outro skit alludes to Nasir Jones' infamous  Hip Hop Is Dead  claim, a statement the rapper has  recently amended . This is a symbolic moment on the record, as  Magic  proves the rapper's potency — not through press quotes or his legendary status, but via the music.    ""40-16 Building"" is chock-full of throwback sound effects from the early 2000s, while the bounce of ""The Truth"" brings back to the Nas Escobar persona of 1996's  It Was Written . However, this album is likely to be more unanimously accepted by fans, with tracks like the playful ""Wu for the Children"" taking listeners down memory lane as Nas insightfully reflects on his place in the rap world and broader society.    As the album progresses, the cliché of ""all killer, no filler"" rings true. ""Hollywood Gangsta"" directly addresses the New York drill movement and its tragic repercussions without becoming preachy. Similarly, when Nas teams up with iconic producer  DJ Premier  and fellow NYC rapper  A$AP Rocky  on ""Wave Gods,"" the chorus scratching and boom bap beat are never in danger of being corny. Instead, the track proves that Nas doesn't depend on Hit-Boy and can meld generations to concoct a standout song.     Magic  closes with the majestic ""Dedicated,"" as a sumptuous beat switch allows Nas to effortlessly change flows. This caps off an immaculate project that finds Nas regaining top form and will surely find its way close to the top of his illustrious discography, which is aging like fine wine.    Nas himself sums up the project in the chorus of ""Wu for the Children"": ""Special like my classics / Special like my listeners who have attachments / To my old style, won't let me pass it.""

2022-01-10,Wesley McLean,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Weeknd Cements His Status as an All-Time Great on 'Dawn FM',,"It's rare to be able to acknowledge the presence of an all-time great while they're still in their prime, but when an artist has made it as apparent as  the Weeknd  has, it becomes impossible to ignore. Toronto-born Abel Tesfaye has undoubtedly become one of the biggest names in music today, essentially living at the top of the charts since 2014. Impressively, he has maintained that position without ever allowing the success of one record to dictate the sound of the next. Instead of chasing continued success through familiarity, he has continually experimented with his music and constantly re-invented and pushed the boundaries of his sound with every release, a trend that continues with his latest,  Dawn FM .    This project is easily the most conceptually sound, concise and cohesive Weeknd project to date, but not at the expense of variety.  Dawn FM  is an extremely ambitious body of work, fusing elements from R&B, hip-hop, disco, new wave, electropop and synthpop to create a unique and ethereal soundscape that somehow manages to feel incredibly futuristic while being drenched in '80s nostalgia. The result is a musical backdrop that helps to score the album's complex narrative in an endearing and enchanting manner that perfectly fits its concept, helping to enhance it even further.     Dawn FM  plays as a fictional radio show on a station of the same name, hosted by none other than  Jim Carrey , who guides the listener through purgatory, aiding them as they patiently wait to make their transition and ""step into the light."" Carrey is perfect in this role, as his spoken-word interludes all exude a certain celestial quality that, in conjunction with the sublimely produced soundscape, evokes a truly transcendent feeling. It's an extremely well-executed and interesting concept, and it becomes even more so when one considers how this album, and its narrative, fit into the Weeknd's discography.     There have been common threads throughout all of Tesfaye's projects as the Weeknd, regardless of how different they've been from one another. Since the mixtape days, Tesfaye's music has often been characterized as nihilistic, telling tales of himself in disrepair, and the escape that he sought through drugs, sex and excess, leaving behind a path of destruction. While there are remnants of those themes on this LP, it's nowhere near as present, and this project also happens to be his most upbeat by far.  Dawn FM 's concept may, on the surface, be about transitioning into the afterlife, but it also seemingly plays as an allegory for Tesfaye's cathartic escape from the personal purgatory that he's held himself in for so long.    In a catalogue that is filled with so many moments of self-destruction and sorrow, it's refreshing to hear a lighter and more upbeat approach to the music while Carrey delivers lines like ""Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed / Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame."" One can't help but see how the concept, while applicable to any listener, applies directly to Tesfaye. There's a feeling of clarity here that just wasn't present on past Weeknd projects, as if a fog has been lifted, revealing an artist who is not just at his very best but at a personal turning point as well.     Whereas much of his music up to this point has been rife with tales of debauchery and drug abuse, with Tesfaye displaying a nonchalant disregard for his own life and the damage left in his wake, he approaches  Dawn FM  with a more thoughtful, remorseful tone. He is no longer the drug-addled Casanova he once presented himself as, and he's no longer living a life with reckless abandon for his own wellbeing as well as the emotional wellbeing of any woman who crosses his path. This is a person learning from their past and wanting to be free of their guilt and shame, a person who is looking inward, recognizing their faults, and attempting to grow into someone better.     This feeling is communicated throughout most of the album, but it's at its most potent on its standout tracks. On ""Out of Time,"" a sparkling, smooth '80s R&B-inspired track, sees Tesfaye acknowledging the error in his ways (""The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby / There's so much trauma in my life / I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby / I look back now and I realize"") and pining for another chance. Meanwhile, ""Less Than Zero"" is an admission of the immense guilt he feels for his actions in a past relationship, and the shame he feels knowing that his former partner now sees him as ""less than zero."" Moments like are a far cry from earlier hits like ""Wicked Games"" and ""The Hills,"" which depicted the artist as a heartless sadist fixated on substance-fuelled flings free of commitment.    It's for these reasons that  Dawn FM  feels like a truly pivotal moment in the Weeknd's already illustrious career. It's a brilliant new benchmark in his already stellar discography, showcasing just how much of an artistic powerhouse he has become and a clear shift from the darkness that his music, even at its poppiest, once embodied. The growth Tesfaye has demonstrated not even two years after the excellence of  After Hours  leaves the realm of possibilities for his future release endless. With  Dawn FM , Abel Tesfaye has truly cemented himself as one of the modern greats, and it's been a treat to be able to experience it in real-time.

2022-01-12,Michael Di Gennaro,7,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Gunna Is Best When He Stays in His Lane on 'DS4EVER',,"Like any emerging rap artist from the South,  Gunna 's emergence into the hip-hop consciousness in the late 2010s was met with a number of comparisons. For some, he sounded too much like the man who signed him, Young Thug; others had trouble distinguishing him from partner-in-crime Lil Baby when they rapped together. In reality, Gunna never really sounded like either: he's much too relaxed to be confused with the eccentric Thug, and Baby's rugged intensity is more of a contrast to his signature laid-back nature than a similarity. The best parallel to Gunna isn't even one of his contemporaries or a Southern rapper at all; it's Mase. It all checks out: they both emphasize opulence and indulgence in their music, wear equally ridiculous outfits, and worry less about being the hardest or best MC and more about being the flyest one.    If the finely aged, criminally underrated  Harlem World  epitomized exactly what Mase was about, then 2018's  Drip Season 3  did the same for Gunna. Both wielded multiple strong singles (""What You Want,"" ""Lookin at Me"" and ""Feel So Good"" for the former, ""Oh Okay"" and ""Top Off"" for the latter) and are shockingly consistent in their message that yes, they are richer than you and yes, your girlfriend knows it. Yet where Mase struggled post- Harlem World , eventually choosing an early retirement in 1999, Gunna's career has grown significantly. His post- DS3  career has only seen him grow in popularity, morphing his signature sound to fit an aquatic theme on 2019's  Drip or Drown 2   and a tropical aesthetic on 2020's  WUNNA . His music, at its best, is heavily addictive, and resembles the auditory version of a viral ""satisfying video"" compilation. His ability to find the perfect pocket on production from Wheezy, Taurus or Turbo has become second nature, and his flows are so smooth and carry so much forward momentum that it feels less like rapping and more like watching a perfectly-executed figure skating routine.     DS4EVER , Gunna's latest effort, is a departure from the singular moods of  Drip or Drown 2  and  WUNNA . Whether for streaming optimization reasons or a desire to mix things up, Gunna experiments more than ever, throwing in a few R&B cuts and some Rod Wave-esque ""pain"" songs. The experiments are mostly hit-or-miss; where some, like the Keith Sweat-sampling ""livin wild"" and closer ""so far head > empire"" succeed at shedding a more personal light into the rapper's life, the R&B collaborations can come off as phoned-in, playlist fodder in order to cover all bases. Considering Gunna already has such a calm, laidback approach to making music, the possibility of inviting singers into his world could have yielded interesting results; instead, he awkwardly fits onto his own tracks, and ends up coming off as a featured artist on his own album.    The varied success of the songs that look to expand Gunna's palette are balanced out with a number of records that call back to the vibe of the previous  Drip Season  tapes, dominating the record's strong first half and keeping its backside afloat. Whether buttery smooth (""south to west"" ""flooded"") or dark and brooding (""pushin P"", ""idk that bitch""), they're displays of a master at work, someone who knows exactly the type of emotional reaction he wants to get from his audience and how to reach it.    He's also found organic chemistry with many of the rapping guests on the album, specifically  Young Thug ,  Future  and  Kodak Black . Unlike the singers on the record, he plays off them perfectly, often going back-and-forth with his guest and elevating them along the way. These are the moments on  DS4EVER  that remind you why Gunna has become so popular; he's able to lend some of his borderline-unreasonable confidence into his audience and his guests. The high points of  DS4EVER  provide escapism in its most enjoyable form: it doesn't matter where you are in life; when you hear a song like ""poochie gown"", with its pummeling  Metro Boomin  beat and its unrelenting bravado, you're young, rich, and sought-after.      DS4EVER  is certainly a good mainstream rap record, and fans of Gunna and the community of high-profile Atlanta artists he's aligned with will find plenty to enjoy across the album's 19 tracks. Still, the question of where he goes from here is left for listeners to wonder. The attempts at diversifying his sound go over decent at best, and while he's mastered his specific lane of luxury rap, the time will come when it either becomes dated or his fanbase simply loses interest. It would be foolish to totally count out someone who was able to forge a distinct sonic identity in what is possibly music's most saturated genre, and it's exciting to see Gunna actively looking for new ways to innovate on his signature sound even if they didn't come out perfect this time around. With the  Drip Season  era coming to a close with  DS4EVER 's release, here's to hoping the next chapter of Gunna's career is just as addicting as the first.

2022-01-12,Max Heilman,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Chastity Plumbs the Passion of Emo on 'Suffer Summer',,"The genius of  Chastity 's 2018 debut  Death Lust  manifests in the many roads it opened for the project's mastermind Brandon Williams.  Death Lust  brought together everything from Deftones and Helmet, to the Smashing Pumpkins and Hum, allowing 2019's  Home Made Satan  to favor haunting lyricism and jangly angst while grounding itself in a comparable stylistic nexus. Suffice to say,  Suffer Summer  preserves key tenets of this nexus, this time recalling the palatable hooks and passionate depth of '90s and 2000s emo.     It's telling that Williams released ""Pummeling"" as a single, considering he had second thoughts about dropping a song so cut-and-dry. The song's simple, infectious riffs and ear-worm melodies immediately set a distinct tone from Chastity's darker, moodier past. Indeed, comparisons to classic emo run deeper than Williams collaborating with Alexisonfire's Dallas Green on ""Vicious Circle."" Complete with swelling string accompaniment, this surprisingly lush ballad solidifies  Suffer Summer  as an unapologetically pleasant iteration of Chastity's sound.     So pleasant, in fact, that processing the despondent pep talk within ""Real World"" might require reading the lyrics without listening to Williams' singing: ""I think I'd rather suffer / I always feel worse / before I feel better.""  Suffer Summer 's road-weary grappling with happiness (or a longing thereof), gives the lovesick ""When You Go Home I Withdrawal"" a uniquely endearing melancholy: ""Kept the door unlocked / So you could get right back in."" Co-written by PUP frontman and friend of the band Stefan Babcock, both these tracks deliver exhilarating syncopation and anthemic sheen with respective splendour.     Deeper cuts help clarify why Deathwish Inc., of all labels, released  Suffer Summer  internationally. Regardless of the extreme music Deathwish usually caters to, it's no easy feat to dismiss Chastity's tenacious choruses and dynamic nuances because ""it's not angry enough."" Whether it's the chest-pumping grit of the riff-tastic ""Overstimulate,"" or the buoyant gloss and climatic peaks of ""The Barbed Wire Fence Around Happiness,"" Williams extracts convincing intensity and memorable motifs from every end of  Suffer Summer 's sonic spectrum.     As a more streamlined affair,  Suffer Summer  greatly benefits from a bolstered production value. ""Dying To Live"" can hit harder with its mid-tempo bounce, but also elevate Williams' straightforward vocal leads with sweeping shifts to oscillated drum tones and glistening guitar ambiance — two aspects it shares with ""Somersault."" Based on a voice memo Dallas Green sent to Williams (aptly titled ""Pumpkins""), ""Somersault"" nods to the orchestral beauty of Smashing Pumpkins' ""Tonight, Tonight"" atop hypnotic, vigorous riffage. Blissful nihilism secures the song's place as an album highlight, hitting at the centre of pandemic dread: ""Stay in bed 'cause it's safe / I don't leave, it's doomsday.""      Suffer Summer 's emotional quotient hits critical mass with the deceptively energized ""Happy Face,"" dedicated to Williams' friend — a victim of fentanyl overdose. His memoir paints a heart-wrenching portrait of loss and addiction with his most passionate singing to date: ""Dopamine is hidden in a lot of deathly places / You're the part of me that's missing."" Williams encapsulates this balance of vulnerability and arresting melodies with final cut ""Smiling."" Its pristine, strummed acoustic guitar and placid groove brings  Suffer Summer  full circle, in pursuit of elusive hope in the midst of hardship.     From start to finish, there's enough gnarly distortion and explosive percussion to connect this album's most poppy arrangements to Chastity's raw inception. In this lies the overarching significance of  Suffer Summer  as Williams' third artistic metamorphosis. Williams offers a more accessible facet of his vision, but retains the fervent personality that first made Chastity one of Ontario rock's finest up-and-comers.

2022-01-13,Dylan Barnabe,9,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Bonobo's 'Fragments' Is an Inspiring Meld of Organic and Electronic,,"From the moment  Fragments  begins, you know you've arrived. Where is of little consequence — it's certainly not bearing of any physical location. Rather, it's a place of spiritual reflection and familiar reverie that British producer and DJ  Bonobo , a.k.a. Simon Green, has carefully refined for over two decades. From early days as a downtempo solo project to becoming a worldwide headliner and five-time Grammy nominee, Bonobo has become synonymous with some of today's best emotive dance music.      Fragments  is Green's seventh album and follows 2017's wildly successful  Migration .  Recorded over 2020 and 2021, the album took shape during periods of intense isolation and personal turbulence. Green sought solitude among nature to reignite his inspiration, reaching out to other artists like Miguel Atwood-Ferguson to add to the album's rich texture (see the string arrangement for opener ""Polyghost"").    The aptly named  Fragments  was born, featuring collaborations with Jordan Rakei, Jamila Woods, Joji, and Kadhja Bonet among others (a particular delight is the use of harpist Lara Somogyi's samples throughout). Oscillating seamlessly between downtempo and dance, Green's music continues to inspire introspection and contemplation among listeners. It's hard to imagine a world in which this latest release will not garner the same critical acclaim as its predecessor.     The most awe-inducing moment of  Fragments  arrives with ""Otomo,"" featuring O'Flynn. With little access to a real dancefloor, Green somehow manages to bottle the magic of a rave through its bass-heavy breakdown and pulsating energy. Most notably, the six-minute masterpiece samples a Bulgarian choir, elevating the dance track to anthemic proportions.    Similarly, ""Age of Phase,"" ""Rosewood"" and ""Closer"" hold dance floor potential, while ""From You,"" ""Tides"" and ""Day by Day"" elicit Bonobo's classic roots. In particular, Bonet's vocals on ""Day By Day,"" as well as the elegiac saxophone, are immediately reminiscent of Andreya Triana's liquid gold on 2010's  Black Sands .  It closes the album with the hopeful refrain, ""Inch by inch, day by day / We'll make this a better place."" In this way,  Fragments  charts the ebb and flow of our collective struggle and perseverance, choosing to end in optimism.        Though Green excels at the many production-heavy elements, such as stitching together the perfect loop or drum beat, he remains unchallenged when it comes to his ability to create organic sound that is at once full-bodied, warm, and filled with textures from around the world. Bonobo's growth, too, across the past two decades has seen a natural and consistent progression, each record building beautifully on the last.  Fragments  is no exception. It is an album to find love again; to reignite creativity; to regain hope; to find connection.

2022-01-14,Ian Gormely,6,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Moist Keep Their Legacy Afloat on 'End of the Ocean',,"The knock on so many Canadian '90s alt-rock bands was that they couldn't make it in the States. Try as they might, Our Lady Peace, Matthew Good, the Tea Party and their contemporaries could never quite convince Americans that their respective sonic flavours were needed in a country already drowning in Lives, Everclears and Collective Souls.     Popularity as a measurement of artistic success has always been dubious. But the dilemma these bands faced then is a useful prism through which to hear new work from any artist whose time in the pop-culture sun has dimmed. In an era when thousands of new songs are released every day, is this music for anyone beyond a core group of diehard fans?      Moist , the Vancouver-via-Montreal five-piece who lit up airwaves in the second half of the '90s with hits like ""Push"" and ""Resurrection"" (and happened to sell a million discs, mostly in Canada, in the process) certainly think so. Built on the broad theme of the emptiness of overconsumption,  End of the Ocean , their fifth album (second since reforming in 2013) threads this tricky needle of needing to please nostalgia hounds while still creating something of lasting merit.     Like its predecessor, 2014's  Glory Under Dangerous Skies , the album ditches the broader sonic palette introduced on  Mercedes Five and Dime  and singer David Usher's solo work in favour of a focus on the basics: guitar riffs and Usher's knack for impassioned vocal hooks. The band have always been a bit self-serious, but in the '90s, who wasn't? Usher remains a master of wringing drama from weighty subject matter. Bass player Jeff Pearce returned to the fold after sitting out the last few years to focus on family, and he lets his presence be known with rumbling bass lines that anchor ""Put the Devil on It"" and the title track, two of the record's standouts.     Guitarist Mark Makoway produced and mixed the record, nixing individual flashiness for a clean, cohesive sound. But at their best, Usher was a live wire, his voice exploding out of speakers while Makoway's guitars and Kevin Young's piano trills filled the space in between (""Silver"" showcased this dynamic to a tee). Things here are more compact, the songs more streamlined. Usher is reigned in and Young's keyboards can be hard to even pick out in the mix. It's a safe choice that nevertheless leaves things feeling a little anodyne.     ""Tarantino (Bullet Kill Sex Love Thrill)"" is probably the most Moist-esque song on the album, but the band are at their best when they're at their most unpredictable. The keys and vocals-driven ""High On It"" pulls the band outside their usual lane and is all the better for it.     Like so many of their '90s peers, Moist are a legacy act. Most of the fans popping their name into Spotify's search bar are looking for a hit of the past. Moist (one has to assume) know this.  End of the Ocean  deftly scratches that itch while pushing things forward, just enough to keep things interesting. It's what you want, it's what you need, it's what you wanted [them] to be.

2022-01-17,Noah Ciubotaru,8,"MARCH 2022 ISSUE,FROM THE MAGAZINE,ALBUM,MIXTAPE,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",FKA twigs' High-Concept Approach Elevates the Mixtape on 'CAPRISONGS',,"FKA twigs  has been known to fashion herself into an art object. She was the focus of protracted closeups in her earliest music videos, calling upon the viewer to contemplate patiently and carefully. The simmering intensity of the visuals mirrored the music: languorous vocals that could swell and shatter along with daring electronic arrangements, an ecstatic seesaw of tension and release.    For her 2019 masterpiece,  Magdalene , twigs ditched the aesthetic that initially rendered her a sort of digital avatar and, instead, framed herself as a classical painting. That album's cover depicts her from the shoulders up, possessing hints of surreal features, and in an accompanying piece, brushstrokes seem to be layered over a full-bodied statue, one that's inflated with mountainous muscles. The similarly warped proportions of Ancient Greek sculpture connoted self-mastery and trained athleticism, virtues apparent in FKA twigs' history of retreating and returning with new skills. The  Magdalene  era began with the release of the stunning  ""cellophane,""  complemented by an equally stunning video in which twigs revealed that she had conquered the art of pole dancing. The next trick up her sleeve was a sword, brandished in the  ""sad day""  video as well as onstage during live performances, after her penchant for astounding feats of discipline led her to wushu.    In the eyes of an artist drawn to high concept and self-imposed constraints, the open terrain of the mixtape could present itself as another hill to climb. How might FKA twigs put down her sword and surrender to the informality of this medium?    In terms of approach, a distinction could be noted within the first 10 seconds of  CAPRISONGS ' opening track, ""ride the dragon."" In the gentle coo of her speaking voice, twigs addresses the listener, telling them that she made a mixtape for them, as if extending a tangible object into a distinct pair of hands. This barrier had never been broken down in her work; it was crucial to the construction of FKA twigs that whatever whittling occurred to arrive at something new and pristine remained invisible to the audience. But this time, that process is on full display, unfolding in the music.     CAPRISONGS  is stitched together by recordings of twigs' friends, who are unveiled to be a significant force (if not the most significant) driving her latest transformation. At the outset of ""meta angel"" — the project's offering that most closely resembles the dazzling slow-burns twigs is known to expertly command — she confides in them that she aspires to be less timid, and is met with responses that both lift her up and lovingly make fun of her earnestness, a fitting introduction to a song about incinerating one's ego. Ironically, the empowering messages that enabled twigs to let loose and pursue the structureless endeavour of creating a mixtape ended up providing its unifying thread.    Like the presence of friends, openness to musical collaborators seems vital to the ethos of this project. To be about de-centering the self and invigorating our fading memory of what it feels like to gather, other people are needed, populating the mix if not the shared physical space of a studio, party or club. Principal collaborator and executive producer  El Guincho  excels at summoning the desired sensation with thrumming, sweating production that invites twigs to play with her punchiest delivery to date. She seizes the opportunity to talk her shit on ""honda,"" carving out rap cadences alongside  Pa Salieu , who contributes a perfect, pithy verse. Like ""honda,"" the tape's most consuming tracks (""ride the dragon,"" ""tears in the club,"" ""oh my love"") strike a balance between atmospheric and carnal, potently reflected in the moments when twigs stretches her lithe harmonies across an airy expanse before snapping back into the bounce of a beat.  Jorja Smith  and Unknown T assist in scattering biographical morsels across the melancholic UK drill of ""darjeeling,"" mapping out an ode to their hometowns and past selves.    ""pamplemousse"" and ""which way"" serve as the purest evidence of the freedom achieved on this mixtape. These experimental sketches are delightful in their rejection of seriousness. On the former, twigs skips around a skittering instrumental, simulating the tease of online thirsting before a fan interrupts with a request for twigs to release an official version of her leaked collaboration with Dua Lipa.  CAPRISONGS ' more frivolous wanderings are offset by twigs pausing elsewhere to confront herself. ""Did you give yourself away again?"" she asks on ""lightbeamers."" What might have led one to do so, or any related regret that might be lingering, is irrelevant here. ""Don't do it again"" is the simple reminder that reverberates after that question, like a mantra, as twigs slides between different registers, channeling a whole chorus of affirmations imparted by the people around her.

2022-01-18,Calum Slingerland,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Earl Sweatshirt's Resilience Is the Remedy on 'SICK!',,"Opening new album  SICK! ,  Earl Sweatshirt  exhibits a creative clarity his music has eschewed in recent years. On first track ""Old Friend"" — which sounds and feels like an account from one companion to another after time apart — wistful strings from  the Alchemist  soundtrack rhymes of filling a void with writing and busting open blunt wraps to fight pandemic cabin fever, maintaining ""strong spirit where the body couldn't get asylum,"" finding ""the middle in a bit of balance.""    This lucidity, seldom felt as strongly in the kaleidoscopic cacophony of 2018's  Some Rap Songs  and on the shadowy, spectral 2019 EP  Feet of Clay , is at the core of  SICK! , driving momentum for Earl's navigation of present-day pitfalls, viral or otherwise. While the artist ended up scrapping a 19-song project with ""a really optimistic energy,"" as mentioned in  a recent  Rolling Stone  interview, in favour of  SICK! , he still leads with encouragement, rapping on ""2010,"" ""We got us a fire to rekindle / Redirect the fight where it's meant for / Triumph over plight and immense loss.""    Resilience, and an eye on a route forward, manifest even in the smallest observations of Earl's prose — pandemic uncertainties be damned. ""Keep changing for the better, what to do when your job thankless,"" he offers on ""God Laughs,"" knowing how even the best-laid plans can be sunk while ""swamp marching on, on the quest for my lost halo."" On ""2010,"" he also contends with the difficulty such decisions can evoke: ""Didn't look back when I broke soil / 'Cause every time I did it would hurt more."" On closer ""Fire in the Hole,"" led along by a cinematic guitar loop conjured by Black Noi$e, Earl affirms, ""It's no rewinding, for the umpteenth time, it's only forward.""    This juxtaposition is also explored in a sequencing sense, with the placement of the title track of  SICK!  back-to-back with the  ZelooperZ -assisted ""Vision."" The former sounds as if it were conceived in the thick of pandemic doldrums, with Earl seeking ""pleasure by the gram"" over dour, cascading keys, monotonously declaring ""Somethin' gotta give, cover me, I'm going in."" Soon enough, it backs into the vibrant, gleaming glissando of the latter, ZelooperZ ascending on the wings of his blissed-out bars before Earl picks himself up: ""Couldn't belittle myself / Couldn't be all weak-as-hell.""    However, that mindset at its most striking on ""Tabula Rasa,"" the project's centrepiece, on which Earl and  Armand Hammer  (the duo of  Billy Woods  and Elucid) saddle up to stumbling piano-bar production and pour out clever, affecting verses. Elucid's stoned reflection and Woods's recollection of a night out eventually leave their host to throw caution to the wind: ""You only trash if you trash, I keep it simple and dynamic / Trust the passage rites to life's chapters / I have to write to find balance / This game of telephone massive / I do what I have to with the fragments.""    What constitutes the ""end"" of the COVID-19 pandemic will differ among us, and with  SICK! , Earl Sweatshirt relays that the continued, hopeful push forward into the future — however long — will be all the more advantageous with one's best foot forward.

2021-11-12,Adam Feibel,4,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",'Crawler' Is the Sound of IDLES Running on Empty,,"Well, they've done it. Against all odds,  IDLES  have become… boring. What an unlikely feat! For a group of rowdy British punks who rose to prominence due to their rambunctiousness and politically targeted hooliganism — and whose most highly regarded album is earnestly titled  Joy as an Act of Resistance  — it seems impossible that they could make music that's listless, lethargic and half-hearted. Yet here we are.    IDLES' fourth album  Crawler  is a sludgy, murky mess; a sink full of dirty dishwater in which the band is perpetually circling the drain. On opener ""MTT 420 RR,"" it initially seems like they're building suspense; there are sparse guitars, ominous synths, and singer Joe Talbot holds his voice to a breathy croak, his syllables slithering in the empty spaces. But more than five minutes go by without that suspense amounting to anything. Eventually Talbot asks, ""Are you ready for the storm?"" And you've just got to wonder… what storm, exactly?    Whatever momentum the band has ,  they tend to squander it. On the post-punk shuffle of ""When the Lights Come On"" and ""The New Sensation,"" they aim for anthemic but meander too aimlessly to persuade anyone to sing along. ""Stockholm Syndrome"" is basically allergic to melody and rhythm. ""Crawl!"" is an overlong attempt at old-school punk, a style they already did much better on their 2020 effort  Ultra Mono .  ""Car Crash"" is a slog of industrial noise that shows only a loose grasp of what qualifies as a song. ""Progress"" sounds like an info dump of A. G. Cook's unused ideas; the harsh squawking of saxophones is the only respite from the monotony of ""Meds""; and ""Wizz"" is 30 seconds of blast beats, arhythmic hacking, and the sound of Talbot hollering in frustration as he tries to clear a stubborn gob of phlegm from his throat. They barely even muster the energy to end it with a bang. ""The End"" is there, and then it just… ends.    Even the album's strongest tracks feel like they're only 70% loaded, at best. With a soulful swing and the ring of a Hammond B3 organ, ""The Beachland Ballroom"" is like a punk take on Otis Redding. It's the record's most interesting song, and the most sensibly composed. Meanwhile, ""The Wheel"" takes the ol' shimmy 'n' shake of Chuck Berry-style rock 'n' roll and crosses it with Sunn O)))-style drone metal with downtuned guitars and guttural growls. These songs manage to succeed in spite of themselves, and only just barely.    One of the most notorious elements of IDLES' music has been Talbot's political stumping. He spent the band's first three albums snarling away at fascism, white supremacy, the patriarchy, the wealthy class and all manner of inequitably designed socioeconomic systems. Here, it's a lot harder to make out much of a clear message amid the madness. Even when Talbot calls out, ""Can I get a hallelujah?"" it isn't enthusiastic enough to be genuine, nor is it disinterested enough to be sarcastic. It just sounds like he's reading words on a page.    At 14 tracks and 47 minutes,  Crawler  is IDLES' longest album — and it really feels like it. It's actually pretty astonishing how little they manage to do in these songs. There are plenty of good ideas and somewhat convincing moments, but they're constantly letting the air out of their own tires. Throughout, there's this yawning gap where you'd normally find that palpable sense of an artist's love for their art.  Crawler  feels sad and empty… dispassionate and incomplete.    So what's to blame? Is it the result of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders that sapped the energy and vitality from so many people? Is it the influence of producer  Kenny Beats , whose style is perhaps better suited for the likes of Vince Staples, Denzel Curry and Freddie Gibbs? Did IDLES rush to follow up their last album and push a collection of half-cooked ideas out the door too quickly? However you try to explain it, it simply sounds like a band that's running out of gas. At least for now.

But even though  Silk Sonic 's cheeky lyrics and comedic delivery play like an  SNL  sketch,  Bruno Mars  and  Anderson .Paak  don't mess around on  An Evening with Silk Sonic . For those who have yet to return to in-person concerts,  An Evening  provides a formidable alternative: it's big, it's immersive, and, thanks to solid musicianship and impeccable cohesion, it evokes the feeling of a live set.     As solo performers, Mars and .Paak are both spunky and inherently commanding in their own right. But, refreshingly, when the two combine forces, they sharpen each other rather than overshadow, volleying vocals and quips with Olympian precision. Whatever camaraderie and mutual respect lives in their professional relationship underscores every song on the album — their chemistry is so airtight, it suggests the two once shared a womb.     Not one second on the album goes to waste. It's an efficient half-hour endeavour where every song, (save for the rousing intro), sounds like the grand finale of an epic live show. .Paak floats on ""Fly As Me,"" delivering breakneck rhymes that drip with show-stopping charisma. Mars polishes his charm and sings from his gut on the seductive ""After Last Night."" ""Smokin Out the Window,"" the inside joke that birthed this whole affair, showcases the pair's precise comedic timing and pulls laughs from the pit of the belly. And, as if the album didn't already have enough vigour, the pair knock their performance straight into the stratosphere with cosmic closer ""Blast Off.""  ""Skate,""  the album's summer single, is as weak as this project gets — its flaw is being a merely ""good"" song among great ones.     On production, Brooklyn phenom D'Mile joins Mars at the helm to create a warm, decadent bed of music dressed in '60s and '70s funk and soul. They shine in this capacity — where the lyrics on the album provide tongue-in-cheek comic relief, the production is where Silk Sonic establish themselves as a duo meant to be taken very seriously. The music spares no luxury; D'Mile spoils us with rich instrumentation throughout. Lavish cellos, twinkling vibraphones, spicy trumpets and spirited tambourines provide a feast for the ears; a welcome respite from the lethargic feel of computer-generated soundalikes. Every element — from the type of guitar picks the band used, to the legendary  Bootsy Collins  playing the role of master of ceremonies, to the vintage skins on .Paak's drums — is the result of excruciating attention to detail.  An Evening  cuts no corners in creating an authentic, retro sound.    But although it captures the feeling of a bygone era with such accuracy,  An Evening with Silk Sonic  still feels current and avoids sounding parodic. .Paak and Mars each contribute their own modern take on the music rather than trying to mimic greats of the past. They're expert method actors who provide less of an album and more of an experience.

2021-11-16,Luke Pearson,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The Darkness Rev Up Their Humorous Rock on 'Motorheart',,"One sometimes gets the sneaking suspicion that North America has largely slept on British arena rockers  the Darkness . After being briefly catapulted into the spotlight in 2003 on the strength of singer Justin Hawkins's arresting falsetto in ""I Believe in A Thing Called Love,"" the band struggled to stick the landing with their sophomore album, 2005's undeniably weak  One Way Ticket to Hell… and Back .     Hawkins left the group shortly after, briefly formed the band Hot Leg (their one effort, 2009's  Red Light Fever , is a wholly decent lost Darkness album in everything but name), and for many, that was the end of it. Since regrouping in 2011, however, the group has released three totally worthwhile efforts (2012's comeback album  Hot Cakes  is the best of these), and one career masterpiece (2015's outstanding  Last of Our Kind ). 2021's  Motorheart  doesn't quite approach this achievement, but it's stronger than their last two efforts by a good margin, full of their usual humour and omnivorous rock acumen.    There really is a lot of silliness this time around. Queen-channeling lead single ""Motorheart"" is about a  Jetsons -esque love robot that gains sentience for instance, while ""Welcome Tae Glasgow"" is a goofy ode to the Scottish city featuring boisterous barroom accents (""Eastbound"" features a rattled-off itinerary of actual bars). Perhaps most bizarre however, is ""Jussy's Girl,"" which finds Hawkins applying the famous Rick Springfield refrain to his own situation for a fairly affecting lament of unrequited love. One's affection for this kind of goofiness may vary (a taste for  Monty Python  will likely help), but Hawkins's lyrics are never without creativity, and they're often endearingly un-hip and earnest as well, like he's a sort of glam rock Rivers Cuomo, or a more emo David Lee Roth.     The songs themselves are all largely excellent as well, with a particularly stacked second half. The dreamy harp and strings arrangement surging beneath the ringing chords of ""Sticky Situations"" is evidence that even the most florid and overwrought elements of the power ballads of yore can still sound fresh and authentic when treated with respect (and restraint). It would be remiss not to mention album closer ""Speed of Nite Time,"" a sunglasses-at-night banger that cruises the synthier side of the '80s to an extent the band has never done before. Indeed, they have a real knack for extracting some of the cheesier sonic touchstones from the rock of the '70s and '80s, refashioning them to refract their influences at angles that are new, yet still familiar — and often highly creative. It's the kind of joyful irreverence that sets them apart from the common run of trad-rock bands that venerate instead of celebrate their source material.     Some clichés are easier to rescue than others however, and there are definitely a couple of rock commonplaces on  Motorheart  that could be retired. For instance, do we really still need to be hearing those drawn-out, one-note finales where a band starts slow and then gets really fast, ending in frenzied noise? Recording beat-perfect versions of what should arguably be a spontaneous performative impulse seems like the kind of dusty, display-case energy the Darkness usually avoids so expertly. With the wheat comes the chaff perhaps, and if these superfluous histrionics are the necessary price of the whole, then it's easily paid — and at a tight nine tracks, any fat that needs trimming from  Motorheart  is easily digested. This one runs smooth.

2021-11-17,Chris Ayers,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Dream Unending's 'Tide Turns Eternal' Dives into Death and Doom Metal,,"Toronto death metal sadists  Tomb Mold  buried the competition with their 2019 full-length  Planetary Clairvoyance , which, amid the smothering chaos, contained a curious ambient track titled ""Phosphorene Ultimate."" Its droning tones and disembodied whispers sounded more like a moody intro than a standalone song. Guitarist Derrick Vella captures this aura for maximum use in his new side project,  Dream Unending , alongside  Innumerable Forms  vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Justin DeTore.     Vella and DeTore play in such perfect lockstep with each other that one would never know that their debut album,  Tide Turns Eternal , was recorded in different countries: Vella in Toronto, DeTore in Boston. Such is the modus operandi for these seasoned metal musicians, who waste no time getting knee-deep in the doom with moody album opener ""Entrance."" Aside from this track, and the brief instrumental ""Forgotten Farewell,"" the remaining songs clock in at eight minutes long. The first slab, ""Adorned in Lies,"" resembles classic Mindrot in slo-mo, with fluid chord progressions and Vella's melodic soloing.     ""In Cipher I Weep"" is awash with church organs, anguished transitions, and Thergothon-esque creeping doom, while the glistening chords of ""The Needful"" resemble an  Animals -era Pink Floyd scoring a particularly tristful film soundtrack. Like Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath, the band named a song after themselves: the eleven-minute ""Dream Unending"" drags out crippling doom with increasing tempos before taking an immense draught of Tiamat's  Wildhoney  infused with echoing voice samples, and DeTore's deeply resonating gurgles create a layer of forlorn atmosphere throughout.     To cap the proceedings, the near-ten-minute title track navigates through gossamer, late-career Anathema chords before heaving the death/doom hammer down for six minutes; lithe female vocals rise from the mist, drawing influences from Novembers Doom and My Dying Bride. Co-produced and mixed by Arthur Rizk (Power Trip, Crypt Sermon, Cavalera Conspiracy),  Tide Turns Eternal  is funeral doom for Pallbearer fans, but more cerebral for Mortiferum acolytes.

2021-11-22,Kyle Mullin,9,"DECEMBER 2021 / JANUARY 2022 ISSUE,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Adele Pushes Her Songcraft to Even Grander Heights on '30',,"Six years after the release of her  record-breaking success   25 , British pop chart-topper  Adele  has returned with  30 , taking bigger risks and revealing enough hard truths to make this her most powerful album yet.    After  filing for divorce in 2019 , nurturing her now-nine-year-old son all the while, Adele has had no shortage of material to mine for  30 . But background context and lyrical catharsis aside,  30  is essential listening on a sonic level alone. Adele assuredly pushes her sound forward with a number of powerhouse producers, nimbly keeping pace with the skipping jazzy instrumental and lofty background vocals of ""Cry Your Heart Out,"" all of which are more reminiscent of an Erykah Badu or Janelle Monáe deep cut than anything from Adele's back catalogue (though the lyrics about wiping away tears are in-keeping with her material from  21  and  25 ). ""Oh My God,"" meanwhile, boasts understated stomping percussion for which Adele adopts a spellbinding staccato cadence. And the kitchen-sink production of ""Can I Get It"" features acoustic guitar breakdowns, slickly produced drum loops, blaring whistles and horns, and more, all of which Adele anchors with swaggering singing.    Adele's vocal prowess is matched by her ear for on-point production throughout  30 . Those collaborators include  25  alumni like Greg Kurstin (who co-wrote that album's chart-topper ""Hello""),  Tobias Jesso Jr.  (the British Columbia-born songwriter who co-wrote ""When We Were Young""), Max Martin (the ace behind some of Britney Spears' and the Backstreet Boys' biggest hits) and Shellback (who worked with Martin on hits by Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande). She has also recruited new collaborators like Swedish producer and composer  Ludwig Göransson  and, more interesting still, Inflo of the mysterious and critically acclaimed English band  SAULT . Martin and Shellback certainly throw every sonic trick in the book at ""Can I Get It,"" and Adele gamely rises to the occasion. No one would blame Kurstin, meanwhile, for resting on the laurels of the ubiquitous ""Hello,"" but he instead stays laudably hungry with eclectic production on ""Oh My God"" and ""Cry Your Heart Out.""     Yes, Adele and company have certainly made musical strides on  30 . But the singer's thematic growth is equally thrilling. Prime examples: ""Woman Like Me,"" a kiss-off for the ages to a lazy deadbeat, and the tender ode to motherhood ""My Little Love."" The lyrics of both those richly mature tracks would have shocked the lovesick Adele of the smash hit ""Someone Like You"" a decade ago, also heartening her because of just how far she's come along. It all comes together on standout ""I Drink Wine,"" where Adele captivatingly escalates her voice on the chorus, while lyrics like ""everybody wants somethin', you just want me"" succinctly convey the isolation of her singular success.     And yet, fans of Adele's back catalogue (who, of course, amount to many millions) will relish the acoustic guitar and gentle percussion of ""Woman Like Me,"" which echoes the spareness of ""Best for Last"" from her 2008 debut  19 . Meanwhile, the pained piano and high-note singing on both ""Hold On"" and ""To Be Loved"" will give listeners chills à la ""Someone Like You."" Indeed, Adele has deepened the niches that made her preceding songs so powerful. But instead of playing it safe with only those established tricks, her bold exploration of new terrain on ""Cry Your Heart Out"" and ""Oh My God"" help Adele become not only the world's top hitmaker but also a pop music visionary.

2021-11-23,Veracia Ankrah,7,"MIXTAPE,HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Haviah Mighty Is a Hot Commodity on 'Stock Exchange' Mixtape,,"When  Haviah Mighty  received the Polaris Music Prize in 2019 for her album  13th Floor , she became the first-ever rapper to claim the title. The 28-year-old from Brampton, ON, has yet to properly break out from the underground, but on her latest mixtape,  Stock Exchange , she isn't entirely concerned with proving her dominance as much as she is her artistry.    The mixtape is all politics and growing pains; over 12 songs, she attempts to make sense of a global pandemic, unemployment and a racial reckoning. But the general concept is no concept. ""I just wanted to release a bunch of dope singles without the expectation for it to be deep on any level,"" Mighty said in a press release accompanying the project.     Stock Exchange  is inspired by both the sound and political messaging of reggae. Songs like  ""Obeah""  and  ""Protest,""  featuring UK grime artist Yizzy — where Mighty refers to police in patois as ""bwoy dem"" — reflect her Jamaican roots, and the reggaetón-inspired ""Flamenco"" with the help of Mala Rodriguez.     As a curator, Mighty lends the spotlight to guests based on their strengths. But even in collaboration, she maintains a DIY approach: ""DIY, I learn it if I know I'm not equip,"" she raps on  ""Antisocial,""  featuring Old Man Saxon. ""This that Imma do it on my motherfuckin' lonesome.'"" She relishes self-sufficiency on ""Good On My Own Tonight,"" too, featuring fellow Bramptonian  TOBi . You can hear her desire to deemphasize sales and commercial success on songs like the summery ""Avocado.""    The music videos for  Stock Exchange  thus far are as vibrant as the project's lyrical imagery. In the video for  ""Tesla,""  one of the mixtape's biggest standouts, Mighty wreaks havoc through Toronto with the ferocity of a  Mario Kart  racer, picking up items that aid in her symbolic level-up. In the ""Obeah"" video, Mighty is set up by one of her friends after suspecting betrayal from another.    With the dozen tracks from  Stock Exchange  having been released on a monthly basis since dropping mixtape opener  ""Atlantic""  last November,  Stock Exchange  does what it was intended to — push back on the way music is manufactured, quickly consumed and has its worth determined by streaming metrics. There is something for every hip-hop lover as if to echo the recent push for everyone to invest in stocks, yet Mighty is not interested in selling her soul to the market.

2021-11-24,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,8,"EP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Kaytranada Isn't 'Intimidated' When Pushing the Boundaries of His Sound,,"Kaytranada 's career arc has been characterized by a constant evolution in sound and scope that somehow continues to solidify his core signature style. If the lengthy break between breakout debut  99.9%  and its  Grammy-winning  follow-up  Bubba  was certainly worth the wait, eager fans could always get some sonic satisfaction from random Soundcloud drops. Kaytra's new EP,  Intimidated , will help to tide fans over, and although it contains only three tracks, the variety of moods and strength of its features edge it to the same level of excellence as its aforementioned predecessors.    After a sublime collaboration on this year's ""Bloody Waters,"" groove master  Thundercat  and vocalist  H.E.R.  each reunite with Kaytranada and are afforded individual space to freely express their creativity.    H.E.R. appears on title track ""Intimidated,"" which features some familiar claps overtop of a derivative piano loop that is brought together by the singer's soaring yet soothing voice. Continuing in this contrasting fashion is the Thundercat-featuring ""Be Careful,"" where Kaytra provides a melodic background that is closest to what his fans have come to know him for. However, Thundercat's approach to attacking the song is quite surprising, as his playful lyrics and falsetto tone replace what would have been a famous R&B singer's role in one of Kaytranada's early career defining remixes. Even within the confines of such a short project, Kaytra is exploring new ground.    Those who knew him as  Kaytradamus  remember a more hip-hop focused producer who often blessed local rappers of Haitian descent with remixes and production. ""$payforhaiti."" the unexpected collaboration with  Mach-Hommy , is a return to Kaytra's roots in more ways than one. The fast paced rhythmic structure is matched by a controlled rapid-fire delivery in Kreyol from the usually mellow Hommy. This refreshing effort allows both artists to come together in harmonious and hard-hitting fashion.     Intimidated  finds Kaytra continuing to push the boundaries of his sound while never losing the essence of it. As an artist known for his singular processes and hand-picked collaborators, this EP surprisingly contains the highest profile guests of Kaytra's career. The project will not only satiate fans until the next album, but will also raise curiosity about where he might take his sound next.

2021-11-23,Daniel Sylvester,8,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC","Julie Doiron Sounds Revitalized on Brash, Energetic 'I Thought of You'",,"Anyone familiar with  Julie Doiron 's work ethic knows that, just because she hasn't put out a proper album in a moon's age, doesn't mean she hasn't been busy. Since her last full-length, 2012's  So Many Days , the Moncton singer/songwriter founded  a couple of supergroups , recorded  another album with Mount Eerie , and  re-recorded some of her material in Spanish .    Maybe this is why her ninth solo LP,  I Thought of You , finds the three-decade vet sounding wonderfully revitalized and well-worn. Compiled from songs Doiron wrote across the last decade (including several previously released numbers), these 13 songs meld several eras throughout her career, both musically and emotionally. Tracks like ""Thought of You"" (from her  Greville Tapes  EP in 2016 with Nancy Pants) and ""How Can We Keep Laughing"" stand out due to Doiron's ability to deliver heart-wrenching lyrics overtop crashing instrumentation — courtesy of her starkly plucked playing and a rough-edged backing band that includes Dany Placard on bass alongside brothers Ian and  Daniel Romano  on drums and guitar, respectively. Opening number ""You Gave Me the Key"" conjures up Neil Young & Crazy Horse's dusty vulnerability, while the sweet, angular re-recording of 2019's ""Run"" is floated by Doiron's stop-start melodies and echoed guitars.    Once you begin to compare her re-recorded tracks with the originals, it become clear just how stimulating and energetic Julie and her band sound on her latest LP. This is best demonstrated by how the docile and sparse acoustic number ""Cancel the Party"" (originally from a 2003 split single with Okkervil River) is transformed into a thumping, brash rocker, while ""Good Reason"" (also from  Greville Tapes ) gets a paisley underground redux, complete with aching slide guitars.    Doiron's newly written tracks included here are just as sonically absorbing, as the vibrating, jammy ""Just When I Thought"" allows listeners to virtually feel the atmosphere of the room it was recorded in. But when Doiron wants to convey a certain emotional and lyrical gravity that defined albums like 2001's  Désormais  and 2002's  Heart and Crime , she's able to push her vulnerable and tender voice to the front, as demonstrated by the melodic ""How Can We"" and the prairie-ready on ""Darkness to Light.""    On  I Thought of You , Julie Doiron defends her crown as indie rock royalty, giving listeners yet another full-band classic that equals her material with the Wooden Stars and even Eric's Trip.

Following similar influences as their debut record,  Lower Than Love  sees a matured hardcore band tackle topics of depression, loss and heartbreak. While the subject matter remains similar to their debut, the manner with which these ideas are executed are more heartfelt and honest than ever.  Lower than Love  is an ode to the emotions that accompany loss, and everything else that comes with it.    Even though  Lower Than Love  is a bit of a sonic departure for the band, there are still plenty of riffs that will satisfy older fans.""Life as a 9-5"" plays out as a tribute to the Chariot, as the whole things revolves around one breakdown being reimagined. Heaviness is also achieved in other manners: ""Déjà Vu"" features some of the beefiest bass lines in Botfly's catalogue, while ""Reflect//Reject"" is stuffed with ascending riffs.    The album's highlight, riff-wise, is ""Cowards,"" which starts out with some of Botfly's most technical guitar work and then dissolves into a Bison-inspired ""Fear Cave"" breakdown at the end. When it comes to heavy moments on the album, Botfly have assembled  Lower Than Love  around these riffs for the ultimate cathartic response.    But even more than the heavy riffs, the best part of  Lower Than Love  is how Botfly embrace quieter atmospheric moments. While their debut record struggled to pull these dynamics together,  Lower Than Love  excels in these moments. Songs like ""Lower Than Love"" and ""Intermittent Depression"" highlight these stripped-down passages that create a vulnerability seldom heard from hardcore bands. By borrowing from Alexisonfire's  Watch Out!  playbook, Botfly deliver candid and emotional payoffs that separate them from many of their hardcore contemporaries.     Lower Than Love  is a successful dip into the unknown for Botfly. These songs feel honest and egoless, opening endless possibilities for the band going forward.

2021-12-03,Safiya Hopfe,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Arca's 'KICK' Cycle Is an Explosive Exploration of Her Multidimensionality,,"As a nonbinary trans woman raised in Caracas, Venezuela — at the height of social unrest — and suburban Connecticut,  Arca  (aka Alejandra Ghersi) is no stranger to existing in between worlds.    Since the 2012 breakthrough of her  Stretch  EPs she has played in the fertile chaos of liminality, straddling possibilities beyond binaries with ease. In her visual collaborations with transhumanist artist Frederik Heyman, for example (see the music video for ""Prada/Rakata""), esoteric symbolism meets CGI latex in fusions of human and machine. Her reconceptions of gender, genre, language, physicality, and erotic expression coexist in a transgressive multiverse where nothing is out of the question. Her music lives here, too.    Though she is known for helping produce  Yeezus , collaborating with artists like FKA twigs and Björk, and posing for portraits for Calvin Klein, the essence of Arca's creative mission is made most apparent elsewhere. Following positive reception of her 2020 album   KiCK i   (including a Grammy nomination), she released an LP composed entirely of remixes of the track ""Riquiqui"" generated by the AI software Bronze. Last year she released a single called  ""@@@@@""  which clocked in at 62 minutes. Her contributions to Philippe Parreno's installation in the MoMA lobby — a technological entity named ""Echo"" who responds to stimuli ranging from movements of the public to cloud coverage outside the building — have expanded into an online project (echo.world) which allows anyone to tune into the dreamscape of live AI technology.    She has a vast community of online followers who call themselves ""Mutants"" and, in 2015, she was banned from Instagram for art created with Jesse Kanda for her single ""Vanity,"" in which a cyborgian human is depicted with anatomically correct genitalia. Xen, the ""genderless being"" that shaped her  2014 album of the same name , was not just a character Arca made up. It was an aspect of her identity which she once used to sign off journal entries.    For Arca, fluid embodiment, category defiance, and the merging of dissonant worlds are more than abstract concepts. Her work exists deliberately beyond the margins of what can be neatly categorized.    The five-record  KICK  cycle also refuses to be reduced by a lens of linearity. A press release explains that Arca's follow-ups to  KiCK i  are not sequels, but fractal-like ""expansions."" Each is intended as a self-contained and totally unique world within a larger multidimensional self-portrait.    The first of these new fractals forays into familiar territory, further developing the avant-electro-meets-reggaetón universe Arca started building with  KiCK i . Sung primarily in Ghersi's native Spanish,  KICK ii  manages symmetry and catchiness despite its descents into the bizarre. Gravelly purrs and the sounds of blades sharpening collide with robotic heartbeats and the crackling of flames. Even at her most accessible, Arca refuses to paint from a predictable palette. But for all her experimentation and chaotic tangents, it is clear in  KICK ii  that she is acutely aware of the balance necessary to build a bop.    The record is nothing if not danceable, although the territory it covers varies. In ""Born Yesterday,"" Arca and Sia pull off anthemic pop. On ""Lula Llena,"" which translates into ""Full Moon,"" eerie otherworldly musings are subdued by a hypnotic dancefloor beat on the cusp of dissolution, while ""Araña"" invites listeners to tune into something resembling the soundtrack to a video game gone wrong.    If  KICK ii  keeps things weird while remaining approachable,  KicK iii  practically dares listeners to come closer. The opener ""Bruja"" makes it clear from the get-go: Arca will not cater to those easily spooked out of her turbulent cyborgian utopia. ""Hush it while I lick my bloody claws,"" Arca instructs. ""Did I stutter? Hear me roar."" An aggressive rhythmic pulse drives the 12-track album, which harks back to Arca's roots in underground dance music. She bends and breaks down structural formalities, letting echoes and aberrations create warped containers for incendiary sonic layering. There are moments which approach the lucidity of pop, such as in ""Señorita,"" the record's punchy lyrical centerpiece, and ""Joya,"" which closes  iii  on a note of all-encompassing peace. For the most part, though, the album bears little narrative consistency—only expansions and distillations of sound which create an ambience so overpowering it is inescapable.    We then enter the eye of the storm.  kick iiii  swaps cacophony for the serene comfort of atmospheric subtlety. Songs like ""Esuna"" grace us with raw orchestral elements which are seldom found in Arca's work. While ""Whoresong"" sees Arca describe her cyclical rebound from hardship and the ""bloodlust for beauty"" which guides her, ""Witch,"" a collaboration with No Bra, recites a hypnotic incantation and meditates loosely on Kristeva's ""abject"" over a stripped-down piano melody. In ""Queer,"" Arca and Planningtorock ode LGBTQ+ resilience, singing of the ""tears of fire"" inherent to the struggle in a sea of celestial sound.    By  KiCK iiiii , we are in truly subdued territory. An avant-classical journey into quieter realms, it privileges instrumental detail and tender lyricism over rhythmic intensity. In fact, the record is largely stripped of percussion. Even at its most upbeat, it is reminiscent of the sublimity of Aphex Twin, reminding listeners of the influences which shaped Arca's earliest musical ventures. The  KICK  anthology is an intergalactic escapade with occasionally violent pit-stops, and  iiiii  signifies our landing on a planet where peace is possible. One can practically hear birds chirping in the distance.    If the  KiCK  cycle is an ambitious attempt to make Arca's multidimensionality as human/artist/machine tangible in the formation of a musical universe, the result is neither fully cohesive nor flawless. Her apparent artistic worldview begs the question, though: is it supposed to be?    After all, the anthology began last year with the track ""Nonbinary,"" in which Arca takes wry stabs at those who are distressed by her sovereign ambiguity. Arca seems uninterested in guiding us from a starting point to a definitive destination. Instead, she invites us to explore layers of being with her in a descent/ascent that is constantly both departing and arriving.     KICK ii ,  iii ,  iiii , and  iiiii  demonstrate Arca's prowess in multiple worlds, as she curses in English and laments in Spanish, oscillating between softness and grit, symphonic realness and grating distortion. The records' stand-out moments are almost exclusively  moments : a glitch which grows to an arc, a sudden instance of sharp contrast, or a verbal assertion of badassery from Arca herself.  KICK  lacks a stable throughline, but it is perhaps the possibility of holding many discordant throughlines at once that drives Arca. The albums paint a self-portrait, and no human, no matter how cyborgian, is composed of parts which can be perfectly consolidated.    As a fully-formed whole,  KICK  is vibrant if not somewhat scattered. As a jumping-off point for more fractal-like expansions, though, it is explosive, with potential only really conceivable to Arca herself.

2021-11-02,Sun Noor,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,R&B",Curtis Harding's 'If Words Were Flowers' Blooms with Love and Optimism,,"There's no singular way to describe  Curtis Harding 's sound, aside from how it always manages to evoke emotion, immediately drawing listeners in. Nearly a decade into his solo career — following early stints backing CeeLo Green and as a member of the Black Lips side project Night Sun — his three albums demonstrate a progression within his sound. With each project, Harding aims to move away from minimalism, implementing new layers and textures into his music.    Third album  If Words Were Flowers  builds off of the multidimensionality of his acclaimed sophomore record, 2017's  Face Your Fear . On this latest effort, the multi-instrumentalist delivers a wide range of eclectic love compositions and opts to focus on the more positive and hopeful side of life. Harding also explores new territories, incorporating elements of jazz into his self-proclaimed ""slop 'n' soul"" mix while also embracing his gospel roots. That soulful foundation that encapsulates his sound remains prominent throughout the album, as the jazz and gospel influences linger throughout the record, creating a mosaic.    Drawing inspiration from an old saying of his mother's that stuck with him,  If Words Were Flowers  alludes to paying respect and appreciating people while they are still here. Throughout the album, Harding emphasizes the need for more love during these difficult times, and aims to look forward in a reflective and cathartic manner instead of dwelling on the negativity.    Lead single ""Hopeful"" sets the tone, with a cathartic feeling that highlights the importance of resilience. Harding illustrates the hardships faced by Black people and the need to move forward while paying homage to those who lost their lives. Instead of dwelling on trauma, Harding takes a positive perspective and conveys the importance of searching for the light within the darkness.    The first half of the record is lively, moving in an orchestral direction, with choral harmonies, horns and strings pairing well with Harding's leading vocals. ""Explore"" is a percussion-driven love ballad that swells near the end thanks to strings and an alluring theremin solo. Meanwhile, the last few songs adopt a melancholic yet reflective tone. The experimentation continues with the addition of the flute in ""So Low,"" a sax solo in ""Forever More"" and the prominent keys in ""It's a Wonder.""     If Words Were Flowers  is Harding's most experimental record to date, touching on a wide range of genres. This radiant record serves as a reminder to look forward and the importance of love during chaotic times.

2021-11-03,Katie Tymochenko,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",SATE Pushes the Limits of Blues Rock on 'The Fool',,"Named for one of the tarot cards,  SATE 's sophomore studio album,   The Fool , embodies new beginnings and opportunities. When pulled upright, the namesake tarot card represents curiosity, discovery and spontaneity, but if pulled reversed, it could indicate one's hesitations to embark on a new project. Resonating with both definitions, SATE (the daughter of Canadian blues and jazz legend Salome Bey) has publicly discussed the reservations she had throughout the songwriting and recording process. Thankfully, her feelings ultimately subsided, resulting in a thought-provoking rock album steeped in sonic experimentation and exploration.    At its core,  The Fool  is concise and straightforward. While SATE's sound is rooted in the blues, there are hints of electronica, ambient pop and grunge sprinkled throughout the album. Lyrically, ""Howler"" is a fairytale gone wrong (""Dress me up then dress me down / Pose me in the way you like / 'Cause I'm not pretty when I frown / Nod my head 'cause I play nice""), and the arrangement keeps it real with blues-based guitar riffs and grimy licks. The subtle electronics recall St. Vincent, but the similarities stop there — SATE is unequivocally her own being, bringing a powerful sense of cosmic energy into guitar-based rock. Other highlights include punchy, riff-laden electro-rocker ""Famous,"" feisty early number ""Dirty Little Lie,"" and the grand ""Weight on Me.""    SATE's grand scope is furthered with a series of interludes that punctuate the tracklist, including soft-spoken poetry and ambient distortion sounds. Opening track ""0: loofeht"" acts as an overture with samples from each of the album's tracks. By doing this, SATE knowingly prepares the listener for what's to come by planting a sonic seed before the album properly gets going. The gesture is welcoming and allows for a sense of familiarity throughout the listening experience. Possibly the most significant moment comes near the end with ""#sfc,"" a spoken-word piece featuring Ursula Rucker that discusses doubts, fears and ultimate desires for creating art. It's an existential moment on the record that forces listeners to remove themselves from the album and witness the body of work from the artist's point of view.    It's a powerful moment that leads in nicely to the album-closing title track, which pairs emotional vocals with a poppy melody. Recalling '90s pop rather than rock, it showcases SATE's versatility and ends the album on a powerful and experimental note. It shows SATE's musical compass pointing her in ever-changing directions.  The Fool  is significantly less accessible than 2016's  RedBlack&Blue , and in challenging herself to expand her sound and narrative as an artist, SATE has arrived at a place of personal vulnerability and musical thrill.

2021-11-04,Alex Hudson,10,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Radiohead's 'KID A MNESIA' Still Feels Terrifyingly Relevant,,"In hindsight, Y2K paranoia seems absurd — but at the time, it really did feel like the turn of the millennium could reset the world's computer systems, resulting in a cyber-apocalypse that would throw our increasingly digitized world into darkness. It never happened, of course, but it did reflect the mindset of a world that had opened up a Pandora's box of technological possibilities without being quite sure what would come out.    Into this fray marched  Radiohead  with sibling albums  Kid A  (2000) and  Amnesiac  (2001) — LPs that blended rock music's past with a synthetic future, a sense of dread buzzing through a tangle of circuits and wires. The albums weren't about Y2K, exactly, but they foretold of mass alienation and societal collapse — things that, it hindsight, seem prophetic in a broad sort of way. ""Ice age coming, ice age coming,"" frontman  Thom Yorke  chanted over a cold, clanging beat, heralding the onset of a techno-dystopia as frigid and unnatural as the mountain range on  Kid A 's front cover. The words ""everything in its right place"" have never felt less comforting.    These albums — Radiohead's fourth and fifth, now packaged together as the three-disc  KID A MNESIA  — were famously born from a  period of writer's block  and turmoil following the massive success of 1997's  OK Computer . Most of the band hoped to continue with the rock sound they had already established, but frontman Thom Yorke, feeling repulsed by melody and enamoured with IDM artists like Aphex Twin and Autechre, forced the band down a path that avoided traditional songwriting in favour of amorphous abstractions. They nearly broke up, and producer Nigel Godrich quite literally divided them into separate camps while they worked on the material. To this day, Radiohead remain the reference point for rock bands who set aside their guitars and make alienating electronic music. But, 20 years later, what stands out about the sound of  Kid A  and  Amnesiac  isn't how influential they are, but how they resemble little else.     Kid A  in particular is fearlessly experimental but laser-focused, with a blend of styles that's wildly diverse yet seamlessly connected by haunting reverb and creeping anxiety. The album's middle section is breathtaking: a jazz rock freakout (""The National Anthem"") is followed by a dissociative acoustic lament (""How to Disappear Completely""), then by an ambient sketch (""Treefingers""), leading into the closest thing here to a rock anthem (""Optimistic"") and then finally a chilling harbinger of civilization's downfall (""Idioteque""). It's mercilessly bleak in its outlook, and yet the actual sounds — from the purring synthesizer and flittering robo voices of opener ""Everything in Its Right Place"" to the stately harps of closer ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" — offer some comfort amidst despair. It's so consistently masterful that it lends a sense of order to the chaos. If there's an ice age coming, at least we're in good hands.     Amnesiac  offers no such consolation. Although presented as a stand-alone album, it still feels a bit like a grab bag of oddments that didn't quite fit on  Kid A . Some songs are more straightforward than anything on  Kid A  (the  OK Computer -styled rock arpeggios of ""Knives Out""), while others are far more jarring. In particular, the start-stop beats and computerized voices of ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors"" bore themselves harshly into the listener's skull with the delicacy of a pneumatic drill, and half-formed instrumental ""Hunting Bears"" resembles an isolated guitar stem that was included on the album in some sort of error at the pressing plant.    But most importantly,  Amnesiac  has ""Pyramid Song"" — a spine-tingling masterpiece that's a shoo-in for any ""Top Five Radiohead Songs"" list. Its interpretation of a 4/4 rhythm is so complex that, 20 years later,  people are still trying to figure it out , and the lyrics are simultaneously vivid and total nonsense. ""I jumped in the river, what did I see? / Black-eyed angels swam with me / A moon full of stars and astral cars,"" Yorke moans, like a person who has been to the other side of a black hole and lived to tell the tale. It's avant-garde music at its most inviting, sounding freakishly alien and instantly transportive.    If  Amnesiac  is a bit scattershot, the bonus disc  Kid Amnesiae  is even more so. A collection of offcuts, it does what deluxe reissue bonus tracks are supposed to do: offer moments of revelation alongside strange castoffs that, even if they don't necessarily  need  to exist, give devoted fans insight into the creation of the album. The extras here are far less substantial than those from 2017's  OKNOTOK , as  Kid Amnesiae  plays out like a fever dream, with moments of familiarity blending together with scraps of new content, abstract vignettes giving way to more fully realized scenes.    A new version of ""Like Spinning Plates"" is particularly essential, combining the whooshing digital weirdness of the album version with the haunting piano arpeggios of the  beloved live version . It's as if Radiohead mashed up  Moonlight Sonata  with juddering backmasking to beautiful, unsettling effect.    ""Pulk/Pull (True Love Waits Version)"" is another absolute treasure for Radiohead completists: the rumbling beat makes sense of the chopped-up version that appears on  Amnesiac 's ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,"" setting a haunting groove for Yorke to sing a version of the long-elusive ""True Love Waits."" It stops abruptly and feels unfinished (it certainly doesn't supplant the version that appeared on 2016's  A Moon Shaped Pool ), but it offers further proof of how ""True Love Waits"" sounds gorgeous in practically any context.    The recent single  ""If You Say the Word""  is a clear highlight, its acoustic arpeggios and skulking rhythms fitting in nicely with the more straightforward moments of  Amnesiac . It's the only brand-new material here, and certainly the only track that sounds fully realized:  ""Follow Me Around""  is a long-circulated B-side, with strains of folk and blues that wouldn't have fit particularly well in any era of Radiohead; ""Fog (Again Again Version)"" is a peaceful new version of a B-side from the ""Knives Out"" single, its dry vocal treatment not quite gelling with the haunting atmosphere of the album at large. Several ""Untitled"" and ""Strings"" tracks place snippets from the albums in a new context, functioning a bit like a scrapbook for one of most legendary recording sessions in rock history.  Like new Oreo flavours , these bonus tracks aren't trying to replace your old faves — they're just intended to drive you back to the original.    As I listen to these songs, Facebook has just announced that it's rebranding under the parent company Meta Platforms, Inc., a move that comes hot on the heels of the damning Facebook Papers leak and ever-increasing awareness of how social media misinformation harms democracy and worsens a deadly pandemic. Donald Trump is launching his own TRUTH Social network — which, in a stranger-that-fiction twist, appears to have  directly stolen its code from open-source platform Mastodon . The quaint paranoias of Y2K now feel terrifyingly real. And while it would be an exaggeration to say Radiohead predicted this,  KID A MNESIA  carries just as much real-world dread as these albums did 20 years ago. Maybe our current fears will blow over just like Y2K did — but something tells me we won't be quite so lucky this time around.

2021-11-04,Jordan Currie,8,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Hana Vu Unpacks Uncertainty on 'Public Storage',,"Hana Vu  has had a brimming career, and she's still only at the beginning of it. The 21-year-old Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter has toured and opened for artists such as Soccer Mommy, Wet and Kilo Kish, collaborated with Willow Smith on the 2018 song ""Queen of High School"" and has been steadily self-releasing a sizeable discography, including the EPs  How Many Times Have You Driven By  (2018) and  Nicole Kidman / Anne Hathaway  (2019). Her DIY bedroom pop rock ranges from danceable synths to delicate, instrumental folk arrangements, where she often dissects the age-old themes of existentialism, failure and the fear of getting older, all of which are ever-present and fully fleshed out on  Public Storage .     Vu's experiences with moving around a lot in Los Angeles as a child and making frequent use of storage units informed the title of the album. "" Self-storage is just a collection of my things that I accumulate over time, and that's what songwriting is to me – notes back to myself of experiences, and stuff I was feeling,"" she shared in an interview with  NME . Moving and feeling unable to settle into one space is a motif on the album, first explored on the opening track ""April Fool,"" where Vu expresses an inability to communicate. The staccato piano chords and soft horns drawn out underneath them invoke the dreamy feeling of tiredly riding the train home after a long day. ""Aubade"" is an infectious dance track with bouncy synths and bass about  disappearing and becoming a new person where your old self can't be reached. Vu's alto voice is big and wide, but possesses a sleepy, languid quality to it — a tone reminiscent of a poppier Lucy Dacus, or Ella Williams of Squirrel Flower.     The chaos of uncertainty in the transitional period from childhood to adulthood brings the longing to believe in something greater or finding a place to belong. Vu has said she isn't a religious person, but on ""Anything Striking,"" she waits for something to guide her, whether it be a real life figure or a spiritual presence; the eerie descending piano and slow beats like the tolling of a bell, leading her down an endless hallway. The pulsating synths on single ""Keeper"" make for the type of cinematic tune that would play at a raging house party, but as the protagonist, Vu isn't interested in what's going on and longs to be elsewhere.      Public Storage  is not all brooding pop, however, and a handful of pleasantly surprising sounds lift it up from that realm. ""Gutter"" is pure grunge with crunching guitar riffs, and the strict, tight string section on ""Heaven"" sounds like it could have come from Empress Of's 2015 album  Me . The title track delves into Vu's contemplations on failure, family and defeat, but has the most classically indie rock sound on the whole record. ""World's Worst"" strikes the perfect balance between childhood innocence and the quiet, casual loneliness of adulthood. Soothing, plucked strings that resemble a music box build and blend into rousing percussion, but lyrically, Vu warns a potential lover of the turbulence of her life: ""Oh honey / I promise I'm the world's worst lover / You can tell all your friends / I wonder if I get much younger than this.""     ""Maker"" closes out the album, a hushed, tender folk ballad accented by the soft twang of a banjo and velvety, warm chorus harmonies that envelope listeners in a comforting hug. ""Can you make me anybody else?"" Vu sings. Though she seemingly poses this question out into the void in search of an answer, it's true that she at least is musically self-assured and fully realized on a debut as layered and meditative as  Public Storage .

2021-11-09,Alex Hudson,6,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Something Is Missing, Is Missing from Courtney Barnett's 'Things Take Time, Take Time'",,"Courtney Barnett 's best songs twist fleeting moments into profound observations — like the way she turned a real estate hunt into a  heart-wrenching meditation on mortality , or when she paused for an exchange of mutual admiration with a ""clever"" paramedic during a near-death experience.    Those moments, which seemingly used to come so easily for Barnett, are conspicuously missing from  Things Take Time, Take Time . Instead, the social critiques of ""Rae Street"" are pedestrian at best, as Barnett parrots a popular activist talking point when she sings, ""All our candles, hopes and prayers / Though well-meaning, they don't mean a thing / Unless we see some change."" It's a fair point, but hardly outside-the-box thinking if you've spent five minutes on left-wing Twitter. And on ""Write a List of Things to Look Forward To,"" she sings, ""A baby is born as a man lay dying / And so on it goes,"" a bland juxtaposition of life and death seemingly borrowed from Live's ""Lightening Crashes.""    Barnett still has a beautiful singing voice, with a nonchalant delivery that sounds like she's talking with melody. And just as much as ever, her songs hit a sweet spot between classic rock and '90s grunge. Barnett has a newfound interest for drum machines and songs that emphasize groove and atmospheric vibe over storytelling. ""Sunfair Sundown"" is a gorgeous tapestry of jangling arpeggios and steady thwacking electronic beats, and the songwriter drops a quintessential Barnett-ism when she sings, ""Shall we leave? Are you sure? / Let me grab my bag, we can sneak out through the side door.""    For a virtuoso wordsmith like Barnett, it's a bit of a backhanded compliment to say the best thing about  Things Take Time  is the guitar playing, since that's probably not why most listeners are tuning in. But it's certainly true of the deliriously wonky solo that ends the minimalistic bass vamp ""Turning Green,"" or the Real Estate-esque patchwork of chiming riffs on ""Write a List of Things to Look Forward To."" The guitar chops she showcased on the  outstanding tour  behind 2018's  Tell Me How You Really Feel  are on fine display here.     Things Take Time, Take Time  is an exceedingly nice-sounding record — but with almost no quotable zingers, it's hard not to shake the sense that something is missing, is missing.

2021-11-10,Chris Bryson,9,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Jon Hopkins' 'Music for Psychedelic Therapy' Is a Trip,,"The Tayos Caves of Ecuador are steeped in myth and history. Its landscape draws many seeking a special connection to its unique, natural wonders.     After his last album,  Jon Hopkins  felt it was time to reset, and find inspiration in another source. The UK producer made the decision to take a different direction with his next record, eschewing the beats and expansive ambient IDM of 2013's  Immunity   and 2018's psychedelic-leaning  Singularity  for something introspective and egoless, with raw, emotional honesty. It was from this that an opportunity arose to fulfill this purpose, bringing Hopkins to the Tayos Caves on a creative expedition that proved life-changing.     The expedition let Hopkins shift from a more abstract approach that sometimes unveiled meaning in time, to creating work inspired by a direct, personal experience. Hopkins wanted to create a narrative that gave the feeling of being in the caves, and, for anyone who hasn't been there, the results sound like he's excelled and then some. Two years passed between the Ecuador trip and writing  Music for Psychedelic Therapy . ""I really believe that there's so much to be said for letting an idea percolate,"" Hopkins has said of its process, and it's clearly had a profound effect.    There's an amazingly dreamlike sense to experiencing the LP in full immersion, enhanced by 7RAYS' woodland surround and multi-dimensional synthesis. Throughout the cave compositions, Hopkins improvised exquisite and processed flourishes over field recordings made by Mendel Kaelen, a neuroscientist and founder and CEO of psychedelic therapy music app  Wavepaths , who was on the expedition with him.     In a tradition used in many spiritual and healing practices, the album's opening ""Welcome"" grows slowly from a struck singing bowl into fluorescent drones and bubbling keys, drifting the listener towards the cave entrance on a chiming, sparkling astral plane. ""Tayos Caves, Ecuador i"" follows, and its massiveness is felt. As if floating through them, the details are vivid and tranquil. A distant lone bird sings dolefully as a sustained hum, created by a crystal ball's natural reverberations, lines the chasm and water falls all around. Further along, a melancholic melody trembles through the abyss like a healing heart, lulling the listener. In ""Tayos Caves, Ecuador ii,"" things have gotten deeper. It's felt in the immenseness of the drone and its deep space aura, recalling some of past collaborator Brian Eno's work, with sound signals being cast off into awe-inducing nothingness.     Part ""iii"" follows with whirring and strings that intensify around a sustained wistful counterpoint before emerging from the cave to a world abuzz with colour and life. Here, violins sing high notes and chirp among birds in their own rhythm, evolving into a softly shimmering orchestra. In their ascent back to the rainforest, Hopkins noticed the different choruses and layers of insects and birds and how they would change notes in unison, by their own internal logic, and attempted to mimic this unknown harmony by imbuing the song's instruments with their own unpredictable unity.     Much of the collection has a trance-inducing effect, like the engulfing and glittering ""Deep in the Glowing Heart"" and ""Ascending, Dawn Sky."" It's an ingenious record of expertly woven environmental music, always in a state of enchanting motion, and as one dedicated to being  Music for Psychedelic Therapy,  it will surely succeed on that front for many. But it also succeeds in being, as it was described pre-release, not quite classical, drone or ambient, but an effort that draws from all three.    Hopkins shapes each element with refined, instinctual care – nothing distracts or lingers for too long – creating comforting spaces for the mind to wander, get lost, or find itself in. There's a feeling of flowing through serene, yet vital space, with each sound possessing its own special place and magic, acting as tiny guides on this spiritual odyssey.     For the first single released from the album, ""Sit Around the Fire,"" Hopkins collaborated with ceremony guide and producer East Forest to score part of a '70s talk by late spiritual and psychedelic luminary Ram Dass. The song, which closes the LP, is the only one to feature words, and feels like the perfect end to this meditative journey.     Music for Psychedelic Therapy  is a magical union of nature and creativity, a space where the mind can open, and do so with transportive beauty. Over pensive keys, Dass speaks to expanding love and celebrating the inner flame – the spirit – within everyone, the need to sustain it, and the need to just be, summing up a part of humanity's shared experience with the album's final lines: ""all we're going to do for eternity, is sit around the fire."" It's a simple, remarkable close to a work of such depth, and one that's also a beginning.

2021-11-10,Stephan Boissonneault,9,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Technical Kidman's Mathieu Arsenault Soundtracks Self-Discovery on Seulement's 'EX PO',,"EX PO , the debut album from Seulement (aka  Mathieu Arsenault of Montreal's  Technical Kidman ),  is an electronic collection of songs that explores the idiosyncrasies and the frenetic energies of self-perception, and it could not have come at a more unprecedented time. Right now, much of society is rewriting the very fabric of their being, either deciding to continue down the same road they once lived, pre-pandemic, or transform their life into something greater.     This is what  EX PO  is truly about: coming to terms with the fact that you've been molded by constant, simultaneous media, subconsciously or consciously, and determining if it's a right fit. It's looking at yourself in the mirror and dissecting the pieces that make you, you.      Using an array of samples, FM radio feedback, decaying blips and bloops, and his menacingly passionate voice, Arsenault presents these personal themes and then slowly morphs them into something that becomes more and more unrecognizable. At times you hear muted, but tense paranoia (""ENVERS""), sensations of strained memory (""TRANSIT""), and quivering vocal work, bringing an image of Arsenault almost at the point of tears (""PLI"").     His voice is the glue that holds the chaos together and the lyricism — derived from a more phonetic French, stream of consciousness space — puts his listeners in a trance, only broken by a few dramatic pauses between tracks.      "" EXCEPTÉ 1 ,"" begins with a recurring crackling and bouncing, sort of like a game of electronic pong, and then turns inward with the first set of anthemic vocal melodies about bending bodies. It sounds as if Arsenault is leading you up a grand spiral staircase, surrounded by oscillating geometric patterns and shapes, to an unknown, vague reward of your choosing.      The title track ""EX PO"" continues this build, introduced by a flatlining heart monitor and then waves of claustrophobic, distorted static. Again, Arsenault loops and layers his voice to create a choir that guides you through his micro world.      Watching the corresponding visualizers, what Arsenault calls ""artistic collaborations,"" created/directed by Myriam Bleau, Véro Marengère, and Charles-Andre Coderre — all championed visual artists whose work has been presented at MUTEK, ACOUSMA, and others — adds another audiovisual interpretation to  Seulement's  musical frenzy. They're definitely recommended viewings when listening to the tracks for a second or third time.      EX PO  is only eight songs, but has an almost theatrical beginning-to-end programming. It could be called required listening for any experimental electronica fans or anyone remotely interested in the genres surrounding, but has been too shy to dip their feet in. It's just weird enough for the hardcore electronic purists, but Arsenault's voice makes it increasingly accessible.

Blur  hasn't performed since a one-off gig for one of Albarn's Africa Express events in London in 2019, the seemingly pandemic-proof  Gorillaz  are busy celebrating the  20th anniversary of their debut , and  the Good the Bad & the Queen  is a wrap; how about a solo album inspired by 17th century poetry then? Enter  The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows .    Gleaned from a line in the John Clare poem ""Love and Memory,"" the album title is alluded to in its first track, which offers a contemporary adaptation of the first two stanzas in Clare's poem. For Albarn, that mostly means swapping out Clare's formal thous and thees, though he does skip ahead to cut and paste some lines from Clare's seventh stanza (""The year has its winter / As well as its May / The sweetest leave us / And the fairest decay"") before landing on the words that open the third — the same Albarn's album and the first track borrow their titles from.     Clare's poem balances a sense of loss with appreciation for life's gifts; Albarn's subtractive touch denies  his bleak, observational lyrics the sense of closure Clare's glass-half-full reflections do.  Fountain  goes on to rehash old memories like a doomed time traveler trying to right the course of history, Albarn returning to the album's title phrase on ""Royal Morning Blue"" and ""Particles"" as if attempting to return to the poem's lesson or rewrite its ending, his ending, too.    As a meditation on memory,  Fountain  frequently measures memory's transportive quality against the limitations of the physical world. On ""The Cormorant,"" Albarn is imprisoned on an island unable to touch the passage of time, but he can ""drift day dreaming""; on ""Royal Morning Blue,"" the persistence of thought and memory resist the passage of time.     It's a more focused effort than scattered 2014 solo debut  Everyday Robots  and more delicate than the bulk of his back catalogue, but Albarn's still drawing outside the lines. The album began its life as a classically inclined instrumental piece inspired by Iceland's rugged beauty, but when the pandemic hit, he had to pack it up and finish it in Devon, a shire county in South West England, where  Fountain 's sound profile exploded to include synthesizers, drum machines, and all manner of noises.    While ""Royal Morning Blue"" matches a downcast provincialism with the pulsing verve and buoyancy of a Gorillaz track; ""Combustion"" smacks with sax skronk and deflating ambient synth passages; ""Darkness to Light"" swings like a modern doo-wop crooner. ""Esja,"" on the other hand, is a patient orchestral instrumental, mounting strings communicating a ceiling-less expansion. But as the instrumentation progresses higher and higher in the octaves, the intensity feels claustrophobic — distance has a way of freeing you as much as it isolates.

While the Atlanta songwriter's relationship reflections aren't unfamiliar territory, her demonstrated artistic progression is what elevates these themes beyond classic breakup record tropes.    Walker leads off with a Cardi B confessional on ""Bitter,"" and ends  Still Over It  with invocations from another special guest on ""Ciara's Prayer,"" showing her own curatorial skill and substance in having her guest artists reveal authentic life experiences. It's also what leads to inspired features from Omarion (""Screwin"") and SZA (""No Love"") as Walker's lyrics contrast with their honest contributions, while the standout ""Toxic"" features a refreshingly vulnerable verse from Lil Durk.    Of course, Walker's own voice and relatability work to carry the nicely paced 20-song album. The bulk of  Still Over It  spans an emotional spectrum of  breakups, self-doubt and renewed freedom, until the aptly-titled ""Closure"" allows for Walker's voice to shine through controlled pitch changes. In contrast to her debut, she has become more melodically adventurous, while that aforementioned vocal control is imbued with a greater effortlessness.    Walker also shows an improved ear for beat selection:  t hrowback banger ""Dat Right There"" has its upbeat nature supported by the Neptunes, and when the production gets more varied on the afro-tinged ""Unloyal"" with Ari Lennox, the results are spectacular.     While its subject matter isn't anything unexpected to Walker's fanbase,  Still Over It 's  storytelling arc and risqué production choices add depth to make this collection more than a  solid R&B album.

2021-11-12,Nicholas Sokic,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC",Cedric Noel Confidently Asks the Tough Questions on 'Hang Time',,"It's difficult for an artist to remain both prolific and good at their craft, but  Cedric Noel 's  Hang Time  — coming a year after his  Patterning  and  Nothing Forever, Everything  releases — assuages all doubt.     The Montreal songwriter's latest album wastes no time enveloping listeners in the sort of ambient folk-pop that is his stock and trade. Opener ""Comuu"" launches immediately into its marching percussion rhythm building fivefold, and all anchored by Noel's vocals. Throughout the record, his voice entrances and commands without overpowering, thanks to his ability to build to a sense of inevitability while remaining soft, even vulnerable.    Take ""Dove,"" a duet between Noel and  Common Holly . It doesn't linger in pretense, with the pair beginning the track singing, ""I tried to care about trivial things like love / to waste away trivial things like love."" The rest of its runtime is spent repeating wordless vocalizations over a simple, reverberating guitar line, but rather than feeling incomplete, the song functions almost like a simple equation for emotional devastation.    Much of the album deals in questions of friendship and allyship. The album was largely written in 2017 and 2018, as Noel contemplated his status as a Black musician in a mostly white indie rock community. This conflict is presented most obviously in  ""Allies,""  in which  Noel plaintively asks ""Are you on my side?"" atop a sample of Malcolm X speech. That the otherwise gentle, probing song ends in a cacophony of noise and a garbled yell keeps in theme with the album's moments of mounting intensity, while also speaking to the discomfort in questioning whether or not these allies are in fact genuine.    Noel's occasionally triumphant choruses, bolstered by drum work from  SUUNS ' Liam O'Neill on seven of 13 tracks, helps to keep the album confident and assured in spite of the difficult questions it asks of love and relationships. Naturally, it often presents as the sort of confidence that can only arise from asking such difficult things.

2021-11-12,Nicholas Sokic,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Casper Skulls Find Beauty in Childhood Trauma on 'Knows No Kindness',,"Knows No Kindness  finds  Casper Skulls  a long way from the shoegazing rock of previous material, from 2015's  ""King of Gold""  single to 2017 debut LP  Mercy Works . That applies to their personnel change in new drummer Aurora Bangarth, as well as their switch to a dreamier, more expansive — yet still grounded — sound.     The album centres around vocalist Melanie St-Pierre's experiences growing up in Sudbury and Massey, ON, before moving to Toronto. In turn, the experiences range from the soaring to the heartbreaking. The album largely matches the simultaneously icy and inviting atmosphere of a typical northern Ontario community, and many of its tracks evoke a long history, such as  ""The Mouth,""  written about a park St-Pierre went to often as a child.    This is most evident on standout track ""Witness,"" a song based on St-Pierre's experiences testifying after witnessing the murder of her best friend's father. It's chock-full of strong storytelling details, anchored by a steady pacing and unobtrusive guitar, but it's the last thirty-odd seconds of St-Pierre asking with a plaintive bitterness, ""What have you done?"" that best conveys the emotional impact of the traumatic tale.    The band's soft-heavy approach to lyrics and musicality invites comparisons to '90s icons Mazzy Star, in that many of the tracks feel anthemic without becoming overpowering or staid. Others, like ""Rose of Jericho,"" take the folk-rock approach to pondering love in an ever-changing world — fitting for a song named after a resurrection plant.    The album title and self-same track refer to American Modernist painter Georgia O'Keeffe, who was also a frequent collector of bones in the New Mexico desert. Once, she wrote, ""The bones seem to cut sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive on the desert even though it is vast and empty and untouchable – and knows no kindness with all its beauty."" That titular track focuses on St-Pierre's fear of death, as borne from her childhood experiences. But as a whole, Casper Skulls' latest batch of tracks all balance on a similar knife's edge — finding the tender and beautiful in the trauma of one's formative times.

2021-10-21,Tom Beedham,8,"POP AND ROCK,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Grouper's Latest Brings Every 'Shade' of Liz Harris into Focus,,"Over the past two decades, Liz Harris has embarked on a series of northward moves up the Pacific — Los Angeles, Portland and then further north in Oregon to Astoria — implying a relationship to the coast that is at once deeply identified with it and without roots. Similar purgatorial circumstances haunt the music she makes under the  Grouper  alias, itself an allusion to Harris's childhood growing up in the Group, a commune inspired by the Fourth Way Christian philosophy of George Gurdjieff — to being of a world without belonging to it.    Capturing songs Harris has been working at for 15 years and nearly as long as Grouper has been active,  Shade , Grouper's 12th studio album and Harris's first since her 2019 offering as  Nivhek , feels like a career in focus.    Rich with expansive tape hiss and reverb-affected voice and guitar fog, opening track ""Followed the Ocean"" immediately articulates  Shade  as typical Grouper landscape. Or, landscape as portrait — Harris is a ship without a port, watching the world around her transform, erode, disappear, but she's trying to connect to it; hide from it too. After spending 2014's  Ruins  and 2018's  Grid of Points  exploring works for upright piano and voice, the track feels like a return to the drone buried spells of early albums like  Wide  and  Cover the Windows and the Walls , but then the noise drops out a second into ""Unclean Mind"" and we meet a Grouper we haven't heard, virtually unadorned acoustic guitar and voice, fingertips squeaking on strings as Harris moves up and down the fretboard, clearer than ever before, and then signal becomes noise: ""Tried to hide you from my unclean mind,"" Harris sighs, harmonizing with her own vocal track, ""Put it in a costume / Turning patterns with a perfect line.""    That these are some of the clearest lyrics in Grouper history isn't insignificant. Harris has previously said that her music is ""more honest to the way my mind works when it is blurred and gestural; more meaning comes across,"" and here, her lyricism achieves something similar — that Harris is her most accessible when describing the process of making her inaccessibility inaccessible is itself a blurring. Harris relishes in these paradoxical between zones.     On ""Pale Interior,"" Harris's words lap into each other as she sings of sleepless nights and hiding places erased by nearby lighthouses. On ""The Way Her Hair Falls,"" Harris struggles to make external things recognized internally, fumbling a guitar progression multiple times, adjusting her fingering and reconvening, preserving the track's incompleteness and documenting something between studio and field recording, a decision that diverts attention from the song's lyrical content.    Hiding in plain sight, Harris maintains the purgatorial quality that consistently makes Grouper's most indecipherable performances such comforting places to return to and hard to pin down; there's something so out of reach and unattainable about them, yet the same neglect of an authoritative voice demands listeners bring their own meaning(s) to the songs.    Submerged in reverb, the penultimate ""Basement Mix"" is more typically indecipherable as Harris's breathy sighs accompany ruminative guitar arpeggios and we're left to follow spare clues: a titular reference to somewhere deep, subterranean, foundational — subtextual? Remarking on 2011's  A I A  double album, Harris once claimed ""That album was torturous to produce,"" and that, ""I didn't finish feeling clean. I'd been living in a basement studio by myself for a year trying to finish it, and when it was done I didn't like it.""    Given time to breathe, to live, to coast, with  Shade , Harris has found a new stream to navigate, but with distance, it's clear Grouper doesn't have to commit to one world or another to enjoy their comforts. Maybe we don't need just one Grouper either.

2021-10-21,Leslie Ken Chu,7,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Sad China's 'ilyimy' Captures the Power of Community,,"Nanjing-born Vancouver artist Sunny Chen, a.k.a.  Sad China , turns darkness into light on their debut full-length,  ilyimy  ("" I Love You I Miss You ""). Like  other hyperpop albums made during the pandemic ,  ilyimy  is about wanting to sing and dance with friends and touch each other's faces. But more than that,  ilyimy  captures Chen's shifting ideas of community — how it can create a false sense of safety and what true support looks like to them now.     ilyimy  was partly shaped by Chen's past experiences with abusers in the arts. Their processing of the manipulation, gaslighting and gatekeeping they've endured is ongoing, but  ilyimy 's fulsome set of collaborators is a testament to how far Chen has come in learning how to trust again.    Over the tunnelling, tumbling electronics of ""Toxic (friends),"" Chen points out that ""solidarity's not a perfect picture for the 'gram / My real ones, I got you / And I know you got me, too."" Rapper  JERRYCHERRY  makes his recording debut here: ""Lose a couple people from my life / I just might,"" he chimes in. ""Bless.bliss,"" featuring soulful singer  Khamisa  & Afrohop artist  Adewolf , is the purest distillation of the R&B influence that courses through  ilyimy . The slow jam practices what it preaches: take time to appreciate life's little joys.    Most prominent of all Chen's collaborators is electronic pop composer  KERUB . Not only did they co-produce seven of the album's 10 tracks alongside Chen (pop maven  pseudo-antigone  and  I Am Omo  handled the rest), KERUB also helped workshop ""Seen,"" a track about the mental trappings of the virtual space. ""Watching the numbers going up / I shouldn't equate that with love,"" Chen sings over a luminous, swelling synth line. Despite their desperate question, ""Can you understand me from this tiny screen?"" they realize ""people come and go."" Likes, comments and shares are no substitute for tangible support; at most, they're Band-Aids where stitches are required.    Chen also addresses colonial violence — settlers systematically dismantling Indigenous nations. ""We settled on the lost creeks of Vancouver / On stolen lands / You claimed stolen names,"" Chen indicts on the mournful yet shimmering ""Mt. unPleasant,"" a reference to one of the city's fastest upscaling neighbourhoods, Mount Pleasant.    Elsewhere on  ilyimy , Chen turns their attention towards their own ancestry. ""Between the realms / We'll make you proud / You know our ancestors / They're watching over us / They guide us home / Among the stars,"" they sing on ""hum人n."" On the bilingual ""nbl,"" which emulates the downbeat electro of guest vocalist  Yukari* , Chen warns in Mandarin: ""My ancestors can see you."" Though Chen never spoke with their maternal grandparents due to a language barrier, they thank them for all their love on ""永远在我的心里 forever in my heart,"" a song that urges listeners to ""remember our shared past.""    Despite it all,  ilyimy  brims with undeniable optimism. ""Good things come to those who wait,"" they sing on the chirpy title track. Such patience is key to one of the album's core tenets, care — of oneself and of others. ""Trust me to take care of you even when it's hard to do / 'Cause I want to trust you too / ... / It's a new beginning / You can do it all again,"" they encourage. And on the crystalline ""VirgoVenus<3,"" even in Chen's dark moments, they put others first. ""Don't cry for me / Don't die for me / Even on bad days / Live your life for me."" Chen manifests their future on ""nbl,"" declaring, ""I'm a natural born leader."" But Chen has already proven themselves to be a leader who fosters community: equipped with a psychology degree, they offer marginalized creatives  professional and personal coaching .    ""Why do all good things come to an end?"" Chen asks over the dreamlike weavings of Vancouver harpist/producer  desire process . The almost-namesake song, ""all good things (come to an end),"" is rhetorical, of course. With  ilyimy , Chen has only started building new beginnings atop a solid foundation. Adversity's shadow will always fall on Chen — they are ""hum人n,"" after all. But as  ilyimy  proves, light and love will always prevail.

2021-10-21,Alisha Mughal,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Lana Del Rey's 'Blue Banisters' Delivers Elizabeth Grant, Unfettered",,"Everything  Lana Del Rey  does is cinematic and with careful intention; she's spent so much of her career crafting and redefining personas, constantly mediating herself. Her eighth studio album,  Blue Banisters , is accordingly cinematic and controlled, but this time around, the control is geared toward being carefully unmediated, toward telling stories of her real past. This album is pure autobiography and that's what makes it all the more sad, bluer than anything else Del Rey has ever produced.    With  Blue Banisters , Del Rey gives us Elizabeth Grant, unfettered: an impassioned woman whose façade is cracking at the edges as she remembers her traumas, like a tired lounge singer jaded by the nightclub's smoke. While her previous albums dealt in a sly, winking rambunctiousness, here, a tired sadness that nonetheless is capable of unbridled love (both fierce and gentle) runs lazily through the album, uncaring, rewriting, allowing for self-corrections and cognitive dissonances, of walking forward and then walking back. This album rings vulnerable, like a breakup album, vacillating between self-love and longing. ""Do you think if I go blonde we could get our old love back?"" she wonders in ""Text Book."" A meandering and messy, but still stunning, oscillation between cradling love, frustrated but complacent anger, a sharp sense of humour, and dejected jealousy make for an album that ultimately hopes to be a balm for your blues. It seems that the fucked-up-ness of the world has finally gotten to Del Rey.    Del Rey said that  Blue Banisters  — her second album of 2021, following March's  Chemtrails over the Country Club   — does nothing more than tell her story, and boy did she mean it. Where 2019's  Norman Fucking Rockwell!  was — quite literally — an exclamation,  Blue Banisters  is a sigh. If in previous works she's looking for America, here she seems to have found it and is underwhelmed and scared, as though realizing it was always with her, which it was, in her past. That being said, this album also continues  NFR! 's pastoral work through piano ballads and brassy folk, this time coalescing the two into a weary, nightclub jazz. Taking what was started with  NFR!  to the next level by coming back down to herself, away from personas and façade and types of women to something seemingly organic, whose timelessness smuggles in the contemporary — there are references to the pandemic, girls without masks — this is Del Rey showing us she can be just as diaristic as Sylvia Plath, she can be Elizabeth Grant for us. You can discern this earthiness from the names of the tracks on the album itself: names of flowers (""Wildflower Wildfire,"" ""Cherry Blossom""), events in weather (""Thunder""), everyday items (""Black Bathing Suit""), things platitudinous and simple (""Text Book,"" ""Arcadia,"" ""Beautiful"").    The most glamorous-sounding track is ""Nectar of the Gods,"" whose name suggests heaven — but don't be fooled. ""I used to dream about people like you, now I don't know why / I used to sing about people like you, now I just get high,"" Del Rey's voice confides in a tone more sober than the baby voice she might lapse into were this  Born to Die . This kind of tired sadness undergirds the entire album; this song, talking about being ""fucking crazy,"" had the potential to be like ""Ride"" but acoustic, pared back and meditative — all hushed croonings and brassy plucking.    There's a sense of paradise lost and equilibrium found in  Blue Banisters . Not as glamorous as her other work and not as prone to glitzy name dropping, this album is also more academic in the sense that it contains fewer colloquialisms — though still very many ""fucks"" — and more literary stylings as she reckons with her past, which refuses to be buried, slipping through to the surface as is its wont during much time spent alone. On the title track, references to Russian poetry come through a voice that puckers against the mic — unprocessed, raw, unaffected, and so, so beautiful. We learn about the women in Del Rey's life, her mother, her sisters, and then there's her father, too; all of them working to teach us more about Grant.     On ""Wildflower Wildfire,"" heartbreaking confessions bleed through even more. Though each track contains the superfluousness Del Rey is known for,  Blue Banisters  also has a shopworn loneliness to it. ""Wildflower Wildfire"" best exemplifies this: it's atmospherically lush, heady like the gardenias she sings about, but then she says, ""Here's the deal, my father never stepped in when his wife would rage at me, so I ended up awkward but sweet. [...] Comfortably numb, but with lithium came poetry."" The baby voice is gone but the violence is still there — Grant's voice cracks instead and it sounds like she's too inured to the pain to sing through tears. These songs are most reminiscent of Del Rey's quieter, more sweetly romantic songs like ""Lucky Ones"" off  Born to Die  and the questioning inflections in tracks off  Ultraviolence , like ""Old Money"" and the title track, all three of whose shades can be heard from  Blue Banisters ' opening moments.      None of the tracks on  Blue Banisters  contain the anthemic hooks found in her earlier work; rather, it's all rambling images and the kinds of poetic turns you'd find in an indie New York litmag. There's a stir-crazy madness to this album. Listen to ""Black Bathing Suit,"" whose end crescendos with a clanging, twinkling cacophony. This album is delicate by virtue of its intimacy, but also sturdy for this same reason. It's crafted with confessional piano and weeping violins, in turn balletic and weighty as a funereal organ march, and they work in a muted concert to showcase Del Rey's poetry and stunning voice. ""Dealer"" is a showstopping effort wherein Del Rey carries her voice to the edge of madness in a way she's never done before, like a pained wail out of a Sophoclean tragedy.    Though blue, there is much hope in this album, so much attempt at finding beauty in the organic relationships with her sisters and everyday objects, in the fact of feeling itself, and in the ability to love. Each track is full of a kind of love that, though tired, is still tender, as though rejoicing at the fact that it exists at all. On ""Beautiful,"" she says, ""I can turn blue into something beautiful, beautiful, beautiful like you."" Though still world-weary as ever, Del Rey is, on  Blue Banisters , for the first time diaristic and ad hoc. This album is a stunner.  (Interscope/Polydor)                           REVIEWS   ALBUM   POP AND ROCK   MUSIC              More Lana Del Rey",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/lana_del_rey_blue_banisters_album_review
2021-10-25,Alex Hudson,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",The War on Drugs Aim for Arena Grandeur on 'I Don't Live Here Anymore',,"The War on Drugs  was always essentially a solo project — the product of songwriter Adam Granduciel holing up in a studio, playing most of the instruments himself and, as he  said back in 2014 , ""going off the rails a little bit in my own head.""    But on  I Don't Live Here Anymore , Granduciel sounds like he has emerged from from isolation and is ready to wrap his arms around the world. Instead of hunkering down by himself, Granduciel demoed these songs with members of his live band, bouncing between multiple studios with collaborator Shawn Everett (who has been promoted to co-producer since mixing 2017's  A Deeper Understanding ).     I Don't Live Here Anymore  continues Granduciel's journey away from his shoegaze- and psych-inspired origins, as he peels back the murk and makes an album that sounds very much like his influences. The arpeggios that open the  title track  are a dead ringer for '80s hit ""Bette Davis Eyes,"" while standouts ""Harmonia's Dream"" and ""Wasted"" have the fist-pumping quality of Bruce Springsteen. He used to make music for the heartland, but now he's making anthems for arenas.    Occasionally,  I Don't Live Here Anymore  drifts a little into pleasantry — folksy opener ""Living Proof"" doesn't make much of an impression (it was a bizarre choice for a lead single). Same with breezy back-half cuts like the power ballad ""Old Skin"" and the mellow troubadour tune ""Rings Around My Father's Eyes.""    But even if the tracklist isn't quite 10-for-10 in terms of quality, much of the appeal of  I Don't Live Here Anymore  lies in the little sonic details rather than the songs themselves. It's in the way ""Victim"" careens between half-speed and full-throttle before melting down with a fucked-up solo that sounds like Granduciel put his distortion pedal in the microwave, and how the acoustic guitars glisten like streetlights on a damp sidewalk as Granduciel repeats the title lyric of closer ""Occasional Rain."" Guitar-based rock music has rarely sounded lovelier than it does in the War on Drugs' hands.

2021-10-25,Luke Fox,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Wale Gives Himself His Flowers on 'Folarin II',,"Wale 's greatest artistic gift has always been his ability to make hard work sound effortless. The DMV emcee has a natural knack for riding whatever beat is tossed his way, for immersing his vocals deep into the track, to the point where they sink in like sitting on plush sofa. Seldom, if ever, does the rapper fight the rhythm he's given or pummel it into submission. Instead, he finds the pocket and works with the instrumental. Voice and music become one.    Because of this, we'll suggest, Wale doesn't always get the props he deserves for the content of his rhymes. They wash over you instead of smashing you in the noggin.    So on his new project, the breezy and excellent  Folarin II , Wale decides to give himself some flowers. ""Never won a Grammy / I'm misunderstood,"" he spits on ""More Love."" Sentiments like this aren't delivered with bitterness, though. There is a conversational tone throughout the LP, as if the rap veteran is working out his own thoughts and, at 37, his own place in the game. The hook for that same joint is upbeat: ""I love me, baby / You should love you more.""     A sequel to his 2012 mixtape  Folarin , Wale's latest offering is fun, playful and familiar. Sure, he and co-executive producer  Rick Ross  recruit some A-list producers (Cool & Dre,  J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League ,  Harry Fraud ) and top-notch guests ( J. Cole ,  Jamie Foxx ,  Boyz II Men 's Shawn Stockton), but the album isn't overly ambitious. It's not desperately reaching for the pop charts, which has sometimes been a fault of Wale's in the past.     A wonderful throwback vibe is going on here, as our host freshens up turn-of-the-century hip-hop and R&B samples for the now. Mike Jones's ""Still Tippin'"" becomes ""Down South,"" a blazing spitfest featuring  Maxo Kream  and  Yella Beezy . Q-Tip's ""Vivrant Thing"" becomes the dancefloor trifle ""Poke It Out,"" featuring J. Cole (sample lyric: ""She got a little butt / So what?""). And Puff Daddy's ""I Need a Girl"" becomes lead single ""Angles,"" which flexes Wale's clever romanticism: ""I put infinity stones on all your fingers.""    Wale allows his skills to glide and his chest to puff out on the superb ""Tiffany Nikes"" and ""Light Years"" (with Ross). The former is rapid-fire, the latter more calculated. As always, the beat dictates. Perhaps the most compelling conceptual joint is ""Fluctuate,"" which addresses the phoniness in the industry. Here, Wale examines how money has affected his inner circle and calls loyalty the ""worst drug"" he's used: ""You gonna question who you trust when that paper fluctuate.""    Ironically, while Wale is clearly disillusioned by the politics of the record industry, with  Folarin II , he's given that industry a project worth rallying around.

2021-10-26,Manus Hopkins,9,"DECEMBER 2021 / JANUARY 2022 ISSUE,METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Archspire Attain Technical Death Metal Mastery on 'Bleed the Future',,"There's no arguing that when it comes to technical death metal, Canada knows what's up. Several of the genre's modern key players hail from our country, including  Archspire , inarguably one of metal's fastest-playing bands. Each of Archspire's albums has topped the last, most recently with 2017's  Relentless Mutation  showcasing a mind-bending display of extremity in every sense of the word, and begging the question: how will the band follow it up?    A day may come when an Archspire album fails to live up to its predecessor, but as demonstrated by  Bleed the Future , that day is a long time away. Only seconds into the album, it's clear that the band's footing has never been steadier, as the hyper-speed attack of ""Drone Corpse Aviator,"" with its carpal tunnel-inducing instrumentation and lung-flattening vocal delivery, launches the listener immediately into tech-death oblivion.    The seven tracks to follow offer up the same frenzy of dizzying speed and crushing heaviness, but with enough variation in the techniques, rhythms and song structures to keep the album from sounding repetitive. Any song from the album could serve as a perfect example of what Archspire is, but its three lead singles, ""Drone Corpse Aviator,"" ""Bleed the Future"" and ""Golden Mouth of Ruin"" probably do it best. One of the best things about these tracks is how the musicians manage to show off their chops in a way that contributes to the songs, and aren't just showboating for the sake of it.     Most of  Bleed the Future 's tracks contain clean guitar-driven instrumental passages, and the instantaneous jumps back and forth between these and the album's chaotic onslaughts do a lot to accentuate the intricacies of the songs. Though not everyone may agree — album closer ""A.U.M."" starts with a recording of a friend of drummer Spencer Prewett's, telling the band to stop playing beautifully and ""bring back the fucking danger"" — Archspire's ability to work melody into vigorously heavy music is uncanny.     The album is only eight tracks in length, the longest of which clocks in at under five minutes, but to say  Bleed the Future  is short would be a disservice to the musicianship and songwriting of this mind-bogglingly talented quintet. If it were any other band playing these songs, the record would be an awful lot longer. So to clarify —  Bleed the Future  isn't short, it's just really, really fast. All in all, it's a brain-melter of an album, and Archspire's best by a significant margin. They've certainly got their work cut out for them for the next time around.

2021-10-26,Myles Tiessen,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Wine Lips' 'Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party' Is a Trippy Garage Rock Clinic,,"We all know that scene from  Pulp Fiction  when Uma Thurman's character Mia overdoses on drugs, and Vincent (John Travolta) stabs a needle of cardiac adrenaline through her breastplate, into her heart. Mia violently jolts back into consciousness, shaking uncontrollably with new life. That's kind of what listening to  Wine Lips '  Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party  is like.    It's pure adrenaline, it's noise, it's intense, it's refreshing, and it feels life-giving. The garage-psych band's new album is, for all intents and purposes, pretty fucking crazy.    Every  Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party  track is an unrelenting and ferocious psilocybin-infused garage rock clinic. Wine Lips bring an infectious energy to the album with their fuzzy power chords, distorted guitars, and lead singer Cam Hilborn's high-pitched screaming vocals hardly breaking through the sonic wall of drums.    One of the highlights, ""Choke,"" starts with a looping guitar riff and slowly builds to become a blitzed-out power-pop earworm, complete with a guitar solo so sketched-out that it would probably make John Dwyer jealous. ""Choke,"" much like the rest of  Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party , follows one creative impulse to the next, hardly allowing for any form of reprieve.    Since many of the songs on  Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party  are quite literally about taking a shit-ton of drugs (see ""Tension""), Wine Lips do their best to underscore some of the possible adverse effects of overconsumption. On ""Suffer The Joy,"" Hilborn, in an attempt to salvage a bad trip, hollers, ""I don't know what you've been thinking / Help me out 'cause you've been sinking / I'm so sick I'm on the brink..."" This leads up to Hilborn lending one piece of sage advice: ""I can't help you unless you learn to love yourself.""    This isn't to say that the album feels like a 'Choose Life' PSA.  Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party 's eccentric instrumentation takes the listener to a space where experimentation with drugs (and music) is not only encouraged, but exalted. However, on an album with such manic energy and fantastical songwriting, overinterpretation probably isn't worth your time.    Any fan of psych music worth their weight in delay pedals will not be hearing anything groundbreaking or wholly unique. But truthfully, that doesn't even matter, because the pace at which Wine Lips tear through each track is jaw-dropping. As your heart rate skyrockets from the lightning-fast guitar riffs and pounding drums, you can only think that  Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party  is fun as hell. It's audacious, shameless, and most of all, great to listen to.    Like that  Pulp Fiction  scene, when it's all said and done, you can say, ""That was fucking trippy.""

2021-10-27,Max Heilman,9,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Mastodon's 'Hushed and Grim' Is the Grandest Realization of Their Artistry,,"Four years ago,  Emperor of Sand  proved that a streamlined  Mastodon  doesn't result in a worse Mastodon. This might not be the same Atlanta sludge metal quartet that wrote ""March of the Fire Ants,"" but their embrace of arena-ready hard rock found praise from metal tastemakers and mainstream critics alike.    The secret? Authenticity. Whether it's prog/sludge concept albums, or anthems ripe for WWE entrances, Mastodon have remained true to a unique vision. This vision remains intact as they drop an 80-minute double album.  Hushed and Grim  lives up to its name, embracing Mastodon's past and future with dark aggression and soulful meditation.      Mastodon reinstate their unique chemistry right off the bat with opener ""Pain With an Anchor."" Brann Dailor's dexterous drum fills careen into Brent Hinds' winding guitar leads, as the band's four-vocalist attack stacks rich melodies against some nostalgically punishing riffs. The same goes for the bombastic rhythm changes of ""The Crux,"" as Mastodon build a bastion of exhilarating, transfixing dynamics. It's prime Mastodon, from Bill Kelliher's chunky guitar tone to bassist Troy Sanders' balance of harmony and groove.      While Mastodon could have written a double album full of skull-caving violence, contrasting the singles ""Teardrinker"" and ""Pushing the Tides"" reveals the dualistic nature of  Hushed and Grim . The latter comes through with the dissonant, syncopated nastiness, while the former eases off the throttle for a mid-tempo lamentation. In both cases, the band's songwriting chops become the star of the show. Hearing Sanders and Hinds trade solos over the lackadaisical, hooky ""Teardrinker"" hints at a successful divergence from rip-roaring riff-a-minute onslaughts like ""Pushing the Tides.""      Where  Emperor of Sand  drifted dangerously close to butt rock, the  hushed  parts of  Hushed and Grim  contain some lofty heights of their own. In fact, the sprawling, passionate balladry of ""Had It All"" is Mastodon's most heartfelt number to date, contextualizing their perspective following the loss of their  manager and close friend Nick John . And yet, it's easy to zone out to the repetitious motifs of ""Skeleton of Splendor."" It's during these monolithic dirges that Mastodon's atmosphere and melody crosses into kaleidoscopic spiritualism. Even the volcanic, almost noisy solo work of both tracks complements a palpable sense of magnitude.      Contrasts aside, these 80 minutes pass by smoothly, because Mastodon still worship at the altar of mighty riff. Yes, ""Sickle and Peace"" is in a 7/8 time signature, but it's barely noticeable thanks to Dailor's impeccable groove and Hinds' infectious licks. On top of that, it seems these guys have only grown more comfortable with harmonizing their respective voices over such involved arrangements. The ominous, melodious interlude of ""More Than I Could Chew"" takes nothing from its crushing weight, instead gearing it up for a rapturous convulsion of explosive chords and soaring vocals.      Mastodon also avoid prog-metal's indulgent riff salad trope by writing catchy songs first, and embellishing them to complement rather than to bedazzle. The sensual half-time shuffle and resonant strains of ""The Beast"" don't demand attention, providing gloomy shades of blues-rock to accompany haunting falsetto vocals. This layered approach allows shreddier parts like the intro of ""Peace and Tranquility"" to pop more, while also fleshing out Mastodon's versatility as they cycle through distinct, memorable doses of emotive riff mongering. It doesn't simply  sound  impressive… It  feels  awesome.      Granted, elevating sludgy riffs with stellar musicianship isn't a new concept for this band. What makes deep cuts like ""Savage Lands"" stand out in Mastodon's discography boils down to a willingness to settle in on ideas worth marinating in, be it galloping thrash steez or a foreboding doom-laden solo section. This would explain why the synth-heavy psychedelic trip ""Dagger"" feels so natural. Though it lacks an overt structure, the track remains transfixing in its churning ocean of rumbling tom-toms, chilling sound effects and droning modulations. These moments also spotlight this thing's clean, yet earthy production, courtesy of  David Bottrill (his work with Tool comes to mind, as far as immersive vibes and tasteful chops).      Even when Mastodon burn slowly and dimly, the whacking percussion and thick distortion of ""Gobblers of Dregs"" hit like a gut punch. Even so, the band know exactly when to break the tension with a jammy crescendo — a sentiment shared by ""Eyes of Serpents."" Mastodon constantly find ways to recontextualize riffs, push technical chops and augment nuanced beats, all the while maintaining a potent throughline of empathy amid the fervor.      The appropriately-named ""Gigantium"" closes this massive journey with anthemic glory — the final realization of Mastodon's foray into rafter-shaking power balladry. The song just keeps getting louder, even after the rapturous guitar solo! It's not at all what anyone could have expected back in 2000, but controlled, tactful dynamics allow  Hushed and Grim  to succeed at both brutality and accessibility. Mastodon have crafted the fullest realization of their artistry, revelling in primal, visionary euphoria.

2021-10-27,Laura Stanley,8,"POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Charlotte Cornfield Embraces Sweet Emotion on 'Highs in the Minuses',,"The beautiful thing about  Charlotte Cornfield 's music is how she is able to make stories so personal to her, feel personal to you. On her fourth record  Highs in the Minuses , Cornfield is her usual candid self, but she sounds steadier and her experiences are even more in focus. Maybe you've never spent a summer in Brooklyn (like she sings about in ""Out of the Country"") and you probably don't know Chris or Ana (some of the people mentioned on the album) but Cornfield always makes sure that the emotions at the core of each song are accessible to everybody.     Highs in the Minuses  is about exactly that: the dizzyingly sweet moments that happen even when things feel unbearably bad. In the minuses, there's a pandemic (""Headlines""), all-consuming anxiety (""Destroy Me""), and a toxic relationship (""Drunk For You""). But the highs are filled with skateboarding (""Skateboarding by the Lake"") and a face-hurts-from-smiling-so-much type of love permeates the record. ""Partner in Crime"" is a love story that will tug on even a cynic's heartstrings and on ""Black Tattoo,"" Cornfield is head over heels in love: ""Guess my heart is yours to burglarize so come on in and steal everything.""    Largely recorded in five days with Alexandra Levy (Ada Lea) on bass and Liam O'Neill (Suuns) on drums — with additional contributions from guitarist Sam Gleason and Amy Millan (Stars) providing vocals —  Highs in the Minuses  is both playful and raw-sounding. ""Headlines"" and ""Modern Medicine"" have casual pop-rock grooves that combat the dread of their lyrics, while tracks like ""Pac-Man"" and ""Blame Myself"" have a grungier full-band sound to them. On the album's stark piano ballads, Cornfield's lyrics are particularly shattering. ""I don't even need you to be tender,"" she sings on the devastating ""Drunk For You."" ""Just don't be mean.""    The album's opening song ""Skateboarding by the Lake"" is a brief exultation that mirrors the joy you feel when you nail your first ollie. It's also where Cornfield introduces the happiness that's nestled into  Highs in the Minuses . It's a song about forward motion and doing your best with whatever comes your way. ""You lean on my shoulder and tell me that you think you're finally getting the hang of the kick push thing,"" Cornfield sings about an unnamed person in her life. But she could also be singing about herself, or maybe she's singing about you as you finally start to get the hang of things.

2021-10-28,Myles Tiessen,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Hot Garbage Free Fall into Electronic Psych Rock Experimentation on 'Ride',,"The psych rockers of modern times are usually blitzed out, acid-taking, guitar-jamming bands that make music at an Adderal-abusing pace. Just uttering the phrase ""garage-psych"" will most likely bring to mind the names of prolific bands and titans of the genre still working today.     Every once in a while, a relatively unknown player will break through the scene, bringing everything they've got and twisting the ear of anybody willing to listen.  Ride , the debut LP from Toronto's Hot Garbage, is a fuzz-induced skydive into the sonic abyss. It's a free fall that provides the band with unlimited space to explore, experiment, and test the limits of psych music. The good news is, Hot Garbage stick the landing and come out on the other end fully evolved.     This full maturation isn't surprising, given that the band have been releasing singles and EPs since 2017. On  Ride , Hot Garbage explore the far-off reaches of psych by integrating a heavy amount of electronic music. It's often hard to tell what is digital and what might just be a guitar amp on overload, but the anomalous way Hot Garbage use electronic music on  Ride  is what makes the album a show-stopping standout.    Not only does it subvert any expectations of what to expect from a garage-psych band, but it also adds more depth to the production and helps flesh out the project. The droning synths of ""Soft As Gold"" aid in complementing the atmosphere of the track. Lead vocals from Alessandro Carlevaris are completely drowned in a maze of computerized buzz, and as the song comes to a crescendo, the fuzzy guitar and drones unite, whirling around one another — floating in and out. It's mesmerizing and holds onto you with vise-grip strength.    While most songs on  Ride  feel weighted with an electronic post-punk transmission or shoegaze exceptionalism, there remain a few slow-burning hallucinatory standouts. ""She Figured It Out"" is a relatively conscientious track that moves at a different pace. Chimes and bells cautiously make their way through the mix between reverb-washed vocals and a jazzy drum pattern. The ascending guitar slides through your brain over and over again, working in tandem with Carlevaris' four-word chant that reinforces the song title. At a certain point, the repetitive lyrics feel like an intentional mantra rather than monotonous drudgery, and the intentionality of the songwriting becomes clear as day.     On  Ride , Hot Garbage shape-shift from one song to the next — at one point sounding like Syd Barrett, the next My Bloody Valentine. Despite this, they manage to control their influences and showcase their own creativity. Their melodic song structure clashes beautifully with their experimental tendencies, and the result is a worthwhile spectacle.

2021-11-02,Luke Pearson,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",MUNYA Struts into Outer Space on 'Voyage to Mars',,"Those with an ear for new releases have likely already fallen in love with Montreal-based artist  MUNYA 's cover of the Smashing Pumpkins' ""Tonight Tonight."" Forgoing (perhaps sadly) the original's gorgeous finger-picking in favour of a dusky, Parisian after-party vibe, and replacing (perhaps not so sadly) Corgan's famously nasal delivery with her own breathy tones, MUNYA (real name Josie Boivin) has come up with something truly special here: a proper reinterpretation as opposed to a simple cover that is likely already populating various high-profile playlists.    As strong as the rest of Boivin's debut full-length  Voyage to Mars  is — its title, like the original Pumpkins video for ""Tonight Tonight,"" is inspired by Georges Méliés'  Le Voyage dans la Lune  — this cover is definitely the strongest thing on it. Then again, it would be unfair to let this detract too much from such a promising debut.    There are indeed plenty of other highlights here. ""Cocoa Beach"" impresses with its slinky bassline and disco-ball chic even before the chorus suddenly changes both key and language—a real swoon-worthy Francophone moment. Elsewhere we get more disco-funk goodness on ""Voyage,"" some Beach Fossils-style jangle-pop on the extra hummable ""America,"" and ""Perfect Day,"" with its funky '80s palette straight out of a long-lost Madonna (or Mitsou) B-side. A subtle through-line of '60s French psychedelia (fans of Air and maybe Broadcast will be at home) holds it all together as well, giving  Voyage to Mars  a breezy, cosmopolitan feel — it is a mature, unified sound.     Breezes, as pleasant as they are, don't often leave lasting impressions, however, and there are pockets of  Voyage to Mars  that, depending on one's sensitivity perhaps, offer little more than a fleeting caress. The album's strengths definitely revolve around Boivin's overall style and seemingly effortless conjuration of a specific vibe, rather than an abundance of hooks and memorable moments. The gauzy (albeit soothing) production and reliance on same-y, mid-range tempos threaten to carry some of the lesser tracks into the background sometimes — but then there are little details, like the Boards of Canada-style noodling in ""Tresor,"" or weird deep cut ""Captain Ron,"" full of unexpected turns and impulsive synth leads; both are welcome complications. Certainly, as a stylistic statement of intent,  Voyage to Mars  is a triumph. As a debut full-length, it is also very good.

2021-12-07,Daniel Sylvester,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Neil Young and Crazy Horse's 'Barn' Is Built on a Familiar Foundation,,"There are two faces of  Neil Young :  Harvest -folkie and  Zuma -rocker. But the truth is, he's at his best when he straddles both approaches and (more times than not) at his worst when he wanders. On  Barn  — his 41st LP, and 14th with  Crazy Horse  — the proud ""Canerican"" (as he refers to himself) decides to plant himself squarely between both modes, creating a breezy 10-track affair that sounds reassuring and recognizable.    Co-produced by Niko Bolas, who helped record one of Neil's finest works (1989's  Freedom ) and joined by his longtime musical partners Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina,  Barn  finds Young reaching back to his glory days for something familiar. On tracks like the stomping, dusty ""Heading West"" and the moody, eight-minute album highlight ""Welcome Back,"" he certainly attempts to keep his fiery demeanour alive. But for what numbers like the excellent ""Human Race"" make up for in sonic intensity and gallant themes — an anti-corporation dirge that shows Neil and recurring Crazy Horse member Nils Lofgren hammering out beefy chords — many other tracks lack the lyrical acumen of old.    While even Young's most autobiographical (""Old Man"") and tender (""Harvest Moon"") songs deliver a level of poetry and mystery to his plainly spoken lyrics, much of his folk material here is paired with often cheesy and typical phrasing. The acoustic, yearning ""Song of the Seasons"" shows Young waxing poetic between wistful accordion and harmonica, singing, ""I see the palace where the queen still reigns, behind her walls and lonesome gates / The king is gone now and she remains / I feel her banners rippling in the rain."" But this vibrant opener is countered with tracks like ""Shape of You,"" a love letter to his wife, Daryl Hannah (who directed the corresponding film for this LP), where Neil drops well-worn lines like, ""You changed my life for the better / Wore my love like your favourite sweater.""    That said, at 76 years of age, Young is still making more shrewd, relevant, and valiant albums than any of his peers not named Bob Dylan. ""They Might Be Lost"" is a gentle, whispered ode to ""the old days"" that pulls at the heartstrings, while the gang vocals of ""Change Ain't Never Gonna"" show Neil as angry as ever about our stubbornness to face climate change.     Barn  will not go down in history as one of his best remembered LPs, but it nonetheless provides listeners with everything what they want out of a late-career Neil Young: a familiar nod and wink to both sides of Shakey.

2021-10-07,Kaelen Bell,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Magdalena Bay Surf Beyond the Internet on 'Mercurial World',,"In the winter of 1984, Madonna declared herself a ""Material Girl."" She lived, unapologetic and decked in diamonds, in a ""material world."" Four decades later — and over a piece of home-recorded production so lush and dewy that Madonna and her collaborators at the time could scarcely dream of it — Mica Tenenbaum offers an update; ""We're spinning around/ So let it rain down/ Living in a mercurial world.""     Traditional material has little place in the realm of  Magdalena Bay , crafted with tongue-in-cheek glee by Tenenbaum and producer/multi-instrumentalist Matthew Lewin. The duo's extended universe spans TikTok, Twitch, YouTube, Discord, Reddit, Twitter and beyond; there are few corners of the internet they haven't touched, and vice versa. Their music is inextricable from its digital incubator — it exists inside a laptop screen's 15-inch expanse of forever, the sound of blue light.     The shtick isn't necessarily novel — 'deeply online DIY pop auteur' is essentially a genre of its own at this point, and Lil Nas X is currently taking over the world using a similar mould — but Magdalena Bay set themselves apart with the startling richness of their music.  Mercurial World  rejects the ironic chintz and hyper pop-lite aggression of so many of their web-obsessed DIY contemporaries, cultivating a grounding opulence instead. Massive drums, glittering synths and dense strings land like jewels scattered across a velvet bedspread.     The duo aren't a throwback act, and they're not eternity-bound innovators like SOPHIE, whose own Immaterial World represents the sonic and ideological inverse of Madonna's ode to the tangible. Instead, they play in the vast gulf of neon between those two poles, incorporating funk guitar, bouncing disco piano, and every texture and tone of synth imaginable into an omnivorous take on pop music fundamentals.     Their previous endeavour as a prog-rock outfit is felt in the psychedelic sweep of  Mercurial World , the way it seems to move in waves, songs bleeding into one another — they've crafted an  album , one that climbs in peaks and valleys without ever really slowing down.     The highlights are plentiful, though generally funnelled into the record's fantastic middle stretch, starting with the starched funk of ""Secrets (Your Fire),"" and running all the way through the pounding pop-rock bruise of ""You Lose!,"" the menacing, transformative ""Something For 2,"" the sparkling recoil-piano of ""Hysterical Us,"" and serpentine first single ""Chaeri.""     The six-song sprint, which includes the brief, tick-tocking ""Halfway,"" is Magdalena Bay at their best, a suite of diverse, electrifying songs that chew up four decades' worth of pop spectacle and spit it out in flamboyant, sticky new shapes. Unfortunately, this peak is bookended by some of the record's more faceless songs.     At its most fundamental, good pop music is a scientific effort. It's about base elements, the building blocks of life and electric impulses. The best pop songs split atoms and cut straight to the feeling —  Mercurial World  stumbles when its ideas get too big and its words too indirect, flattening the endorphin rush of pure sensation that drives its better songs. ""Dawning of the Season,"" ""Prophecy"" and, to a lesser degree, the title track, all suffer from a case of broad, placeholder lyricism — ""They say I'm dancing with my demons""; ""Will you be my prophecy?"" — that hint at apocalyptic feeling without digging to the heart of it. The record has big, cosmic questions about time and space and possibility swirling 'round its bejewelled head, but it's at its best when putting these concepts under a microscope. The vulnerable self-interrogation of ""Something for 2"" or the ode to a troubled friend on ""Chaeri"" help focus ideas of time-travel and transformation into something painful and true.     ""The Beginning"" closes the record with Tenenbaum whispering ""Matt, Matt"" as her voice dissolves into echo. It's an infinite loop, caught up again in the opening seconds of ""The End,"" where she continues her call, whispering Lewin's name before shouting, gleefully, ""wake up!""     There's something endearing about the intimacy of the exchange, Tenenbaum prodding Lewin into wakefulness with her theory — ""I was thinking about how there's no true end to anything / Everything comes from and goes to the same place: Nowhere!"" — and kickstarting the record's great tides of sound. It's like a peek into their process, and a reminder that for all the star-gazing majesty of the record, it's a two-person affair — a big album from small places, one that revels in the protean nature of the internet and sees the possibilities for reinvention that still exist there. Listen to  Mercurial World  and squint hard at your black computer screen — it might just start to look like the night sky.

2021-10-07,Peter Boulos,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",James Blake Lays Himself Bare on 'Friends That Break Your Heart',,"Few today occupy similar standing across musical spheres as  James Blake . Of his ardent supporters, he can count rap phenoms, folk crooners, reggaetón hitmakers, and underground protégées all in the same breath. In the last few years, he has made it a point to dip his toes into a great variety of musical flavours, most evident on his last album  Assume Form , an album featuring the likes of Rosalía and Travis Scott, among others. Subsequently, it shouldn't be any surprise that he would continue in a similar vein of collaborations and experiments across the pop spectrum. If  Assume Form  was a sampler of his future artistic trajectory,  Friends That Break Your Heart  is the case of an artist finding his stride in a new lane — one he's long wanted to be in.    The album feels often as though it borders on the edge of manic sonic intrepidity (a shadow of his early post-dubstep days), but in many cases, it opts for balladry and emotiveness in its stead. For the most part, it's not quite to the level of boundary-breaking electronic pop as in, for instance, his excellent single ""If the Car Beside You Moves Ahead."" Rather, the album is a deep dive into his emotional state without abandon. His sonic quirks appear on occasion, but they take a backseat to the emotion on display.    Overall,  Friends That Break Your Heart  stands alone in his discography with the sheer brilliance of the vocal performances. The performances on his eponymous debut and the subsequent albums were all nothing to scoff at, but the crystalline clarity in this most recent work is evident to hear. Images of isolation and ostracism are regularly conjured throughout, both in the context of a relationship and in the context of Blake's relationship with society and music. These themes have appeared in many of his previous works, as in songs like ""Overgrown,"" but the difference here is that these ideas are stripped bare of metaphor and are confronted with lyrical candour. ""I can only be what I am"" he sings on ""Life Is Not the Same,"" as if to draw a line in the sand to his detractors in saying that his malleability is far from limitless. He does readily admit on ""Coming Back"" that ""there's a mile between my heart and my head,"" almost signalling that his desires may not always be the most rational ones.  SZA  features excellently with a verse that alludes to the same point: ""Do you fantasise about the things you really want to feel?""    On many occasions, the album retracts into cigarette-lighter-swaying crooning, as on ""Funeral,"" where Blake feels as though he ""live[s] in leaves that crunch under your feet."" The song, and others similar on the album, can feel as though it relies a bit too heavily on ballad-esque musical tropes to deliver its message of vulnerability. These are themes he has considered in the past, especially raised in the face of masculine societal expectations. ""Frozen"" offers a counterpoint with menace and aggression, featuring  J.I.D  and SwaVay bringing light to the manic symptoms of isolation that can manifest: ""Lately, I've been thinking that I might've lost my mind.""    Ultimately, this is an album about frank self-reflection in the absence of abstraction. It does occasionally err too heavily towards swaying ballad tropes, but importantly Blake never hides his feelings through allegory or metaphor, nor does he mangle his vocal delivery with electronic trickery.  Friends That Break Your Heart  is James Blake delivering a crooning stream of consciousness that lays bare his thoughts for the world to hear, and he hasn't a care what you may think about them.

With nearly a decade together and two EPs already under their bullet belt, the band have decidedly found their sound by now — even if that sound is something of a patchwork of traditional heavy metal, melodic death metal, thrash metal and more.     To put it simply,  Hiraeth  contains all the characteristics you'd find in a description of what metal sounds like, without losing its cohesiveness by jumping from sound to sound. Frontwoman Krista Shipperbottom's vocals range from intense operatic bursts to agonizing growls, with guitarists Victor Bucur and John Raposo creating a similar duality between soaring leads and violent chugs, while an ardently solid rhythm section of bassist Chris Pacey and drummer Duval Gabraiel provides a mechanically precise foundation for 10 smoulderingly forceful tracks.      What Lutharo have managed to pull off with this record isn't easy. It's plain to see the classic metal music these well-rounded musicians have grown up on in their own songwriting, yet  Hiraeth  doesn't sound stuck in the past. Despite its constant callbacks to the glory days of heavy metal, it has a fresh, modern edge, and the renewed energy of a band with everything to prove. The band stress that this release sees them taking more risks than on their previous release, 2020's well-received EP  Wings of Agony.  Though the catchy choruses and earworm riffs of that effort are still there,  Hiraeth  sees the band stepping further out from safe-feeling territory, into a vaster landscape of more epic songs and ramped-up heaviness.      Hiraeth  is bookended by singles ""To Kill or to Crave"" and ""Lost in a Soul,"" both strong tracks that sum up the album pretty well — and though the symphonic intro of ""Lost in a Soul"" yielding into an aggressive power metal-tinged cut isn't quite original, it's done impeccably here. Yet still, there is much more to hear beyond these two tracks, from the gruelling stomp of ""What Sleeps in Your Mind,"" to the impossible-not-to-headbang-to ""Valley of the Cursed,"" to the massive solo-laden ""Eclipse."" It's truly an album with no skips, each song bringing something different while still standing nicely alongside the others.     Why Lutharo have yet to really blow up certainly has nothing to do with their music. With the right promotion and reach,  Hiraeth  could surely see the band reach new heights and grow well beyond Ontario's regional scene.

2021-10-13,Joe Bagel,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Le Ren's 'Leftovers' Is a Folk Music Feast,,"Strumming thunderbolts out of her guitar, Lauren Spear's debut LP as  Le Ren  is a folk music marvel, one that charts the human heart and all of its treacherous chambers — spanning love between mother and daughter, love between friends, love lost, and sure, why not, love for the night.     With stripped-down arrangements that elevate Spear's country chops and rangy mezzo, the best of  Leftovers  easily equals the oeuvre of Canada's very best alt-country voices: Orville Peck, Jennifer Castle, Julie Doiron, and Daniel Romano.     The album begins with the curiously baroque ""Take On Me,"" a sacred-sounding hymn which omits all pretence of groove or hook. It's a brazen gambit only a poet would bother making; Spear lets her songwriting stand naked, confronting listeners like a Greek statue at the harbour of Rhodes: "" Take on me / For I have seen the day  / Where love is in the gloaming / And we are on its wings.""     It's the sort of album-opening line that could cock David Berman to attention and make Leonard Cohen run home to go scribble jealously in his diary.     Because (unlike Berman or Cohen) Spear's voice is conventionally pretty, the songwriter's stunt worthily draws attention to itself — holding you by the ear, putting melody in check — before the album launches off in earnest.     The gamble pays off immediately. The song that follows, ""Dyan,"" is almost impossibly tender, a real miracle of craft, a loving ode to Spear's mother steeped in mythological beauty, worth every gallon of smeared eyeliner it is sure to provoke.     While it's possible that other songs can be this good, they cannot be made any better.     Whereas ""Dyan"" is written from the perspective of Spear herself, ""I Already Love You"" is written from the perspective of her mother. It's more subdued, but still poignant, with an almost lullaby quality to it — arranged like a Magnetic Fields   song with cello weaving and bobbing through acoustic guitars.     Other song pairings within the album are less precious: the subtle snatches of pedal steel that trace heartache in ""Was I Not Enough?"" are put to use almost immediately thereafter to gild the cheeky Tinder anthem ""Who's Going to Hold Me Next?"" and the sensual metaphor fest ""Your Cup.""     It's a gorgeous collection of songs, showcasing Spear's preternatural songwriting ability.  If  Leftovers  is as aptly named as we hope it is, Le Ren's career will be a feast for the ages.

She  bought and relaunched a music label , had  vocal cord surgery , released an instrumental album called  Perséides,  is expecting a second child and, in the midst of all of this, found the time to release a new album,  Impossible à aimer .  In this whirlwind, she managed to deliver an album that finds her exploring different styles and going in different directions.     Beautiful piano ballads like ""Tu ne seras jamais là"" (featuring the remarkable pianist  Alexandra Stréliski ) and ""Une chanson brisée"" (a sombre tune about a relationship that didn't work) show a softer, vulnerable side to Coeur de pirate, putting her voice and emotion at the forefront. Meanwhile, disco-pop bop ""On s'aimera toujours"" recalls much of her past work.    Coeur de pirate finds more secure footing in slower songs with fewer instruments as opposed to heavily orchestrated pop beats which can be hit-or-miss, like ""Dans l'obscurité,"" a club banger that doesn't quite deliver the punch it wants to give. However, closing song ""Hélas"" hits the spot. Using a vocoder effect to transform her voice into an instrument, she greatly impresses with an offering drastically different from her usual offerings    Coeur de pirate continues to exceed expectations as one of Quebec's finest musicians with masterful music production, and devotion to her art and career.

2021-10-18,Stephan Boissonneault,9,"PUNK,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","'Dooms Children' Is Wade MacNeil's Raw, Psych-Toned Autobiography",,"With the self-titled debut album of his new psych rock project  Dooms Children , post-hardcore old salt  Wade MacNeil  is sonically nostalgic — nostalgic for a time in music when pioneer bands like Grateful Dead (there's even a cover of ""Friend of the Devil""), Blue Cheer and the Zombies dominated the charts. Through this trippy wistfulness and his grizzled, raw voice, MacNeil has managed to create one of his most personal works to date, a harmonious grimoire that never loses its lustre.    On  Dooms Children , MacNeil opens the door to the murky marrow of rock'n'roll as its many themes line up with some of the most vulnerable points of his life. There are songs about the sorrows that come with lost love, battling addiction and intimate misgivings. Musically, MacNeil utilizes an arsenal of instrumental techniques — along with guest musicianship and co-production from the prolific  Daniel Romano  — to give the whole record a retro feel.     MacNeil is clearly wearing his musical influences on his sleeve, though it comes off more as reinvigorated punk rock devotion than cheap homage. The opening phaser arpeggios and slide guitar on ""Flower Moon"" brings to mind a soft rock epic like Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Tuesday's Gone"" before slowly morphing into a heavier garage Black Sabbath number, right down to the devil-horned Tony Iommi lead guitar tone. For a moniker like Dooms Children, there isn't too much heavy sludge on the LP — hazy, sun-drenched jams like ""Skeleton Beach"" or ""Morningstar"" are more the norm — but when MacNeil does decide to crank up the intensity, like during the outro of ""Lotus Eater,"" the creeping headbangs ensue.    The lyrics are also surprisingly tender, such as the brutally honest opening lines on ""Psyche Hospital Blues"": ""My father cried when he dropped me off at rehab"" / Caused so much pain, I didn't even know / In that instant, the world felt smaller."" Then there's ""Heavy Year"" that, with lyrics like ""It's been a heavy year in retrospect,"" could go down as the Canadian pandemic anthem, though is more of a more personal form of catharsis for MacNeil, opening with the lines ""In the iron weeks that passed since my mother's death / We all grieved in our own way.""    This isn't the first time we've experienced a vulnerable MacNeil — he's responsible for many of the heavy, angst-ridden  Alexisonfire  and later  Gallows  narratives — but with Dooms Children, there's no vague cloak over the lyricism; it's just him chronicling his story over a 20-year career. Call it a psychedelic-toned autobiography from a man who has experienced the best and worst life has to offer.

2021-10-18,Daniel Sylvester,6,"SOUL & FUNK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Xenia Rubinos's Lyrics Steal the Show on 'Una Rosa',,"Eight years into her career, it's apparent that  Xenia Rubinos  prefers to wipe the proverbial slate clean before releasing her next album. Although she's worked hard at avoiding idle musical classification, her 2013 EP,  Magic Trix , was nonetheless praised by lovers of angular post-rock and found her supporting indie weirdos Man Man on tour, while her 2016 debut album,  Black Terry Cat , earned comparisons to Erykah Badu.    On sophomore LP  Una Rosa , her first in five years, Rubinos throws a dizzying and merciless array of influences, sounds, and ideas at the canvas, often to diminishing returns. But it's the Hartford artist's tight musical acumen that frequently saves this LP from completely collapsing under its own weight. While there's some strong material here, including the rubbery English/Spanish track ""Sacude,"" the cascading, skeletal ""Worst Behavior"" and the moody, sonically sleek ""Si Llego"", too much of  Una Rosa  finds Rubinos's style of first-draft experimentalism more self-serving than innovative.    With her early material pulling air-stretched beats over sturdy structures, Rubinos was able to squeak out two celebrated recordings that felt much more enduring and resourceful. But on her latest, the Berklee-trained musician ops to draw influences from a more modern (and frankly liquidated) spectrum, pouring out an oversaturated Kanye West autotune intro onto ""Ay Hombre,"" a DJ Khaled-level uncomplicatedness on ""Working All the Time"" and a bleary rewrite of Bob Markey and the Wailers' ""I Shot the Sheriff"" on ""Who Shot Ya?"" that's only rescued by its poignant subject matter.    Inspired by her immigrant great-grandmother and brimming with first-person accounts of the struggles and efforts shared by people of colour in America, much of  Una Rosa 's lyrical content remains refreshing, but tracks like ""Don't Put Me in Red"" (""Kids you put in cages, look like they could be my sons, you forget we were here, when the west was won"") and the aforementioned ""Working All the Time"" (""You better keep me poor and busy, or I'd be a danger, the truth is I'm a threat"") don't possess the same emotional resonance sonically as they do poetically, as words, rhymes and wordless laments are delivered aimlessly and without musical yearning.    Rubinos's major folly on  Una Rosa  seems to be her desire to push her craft forward and to challenge herself. And while that may be the main ingredient for truly groundbreaking music, she forgot to draw up a blueprint beforehand.                            SOUL & FUNK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Xenia Rubinos",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/xenia_rubinos_una_rosa_album_review

Since blowing up upon the 2013 reissue of  Light Up Gold , the Brooklyn band have released numerous highly celebrated albums, culminating in regular appearances on year-end (and even decade-end) lists.    On their latest full-length, the quartet tempt fate by shifting their sound, a move that has sunk so many of their indie rock forebears. Recorded pre-pandemic with producer Rodaidh McDonald (David Byrne, Hot Chip, the xx),  Sympathy for Life  is an album heavily influenced by (and indebted to) dance and club music, building an entire LP around the beats and rhythms their previous LP, 2018's  Wide Awake! , flirted with. Throughout  Sympathy for Life , Parquets Courts pull their grooves more holistically, chiselling songs from live jams that reportedly stretched to over 40 minutes. This allows numbers like punchy opener ""Walking at a Downtown Pace"" and chicken-scratch chanter ""Zoom Out"" to show off a more smoothed out and propulsive version of the band's often spontaneous-seeming style of songwriting.    But for an album built around an up-tempo blueprint, much of  Sympathy for Life  comes off dour and plodding. Unlike prior Parquet Courts albums, the band explicitly set out to write these songs in a very specific style and mode, which finds them shoehorning a forced dance rhythm into what is an otherwise wordy mess on ""Application Apparatus"" while building the gassed-out ""Sympathy for Life"" around an unfortunate lounge melody.    This doesn't mean that their downbeat tracks don't make an impression, as ""Marathon of Anger"" comes off as moody as its title suggests while ""Trullo"" features Tom Tom Club aural quirks that keep it cheeky and buoyant. Although the motorik, yearning ""Black Widow Spider"" and the dubby, jammy ""Plant Life"" present an esteemed new dimension to their craft, many of the other tracks fall flat. The wild synth-punk energy of ""Homo Sapien"" lays out an appealing blueprint for the band to follow, but it's as if they ran out of stream, leaving the listener with a few listless songs instead.     Sympathy for Life  isn't a failure as much as it's just a step down from the indie rock podium. There's still a lot to admire for longtime Parquet Courts fans here, while the rest just requires some patience and a bit of unconditional love.

And even though the song sounds nothing like its namesake, Wolf actually does a pretty damn good job at embodying everything that's good about Red Hot Chili Peppers:  Juno  is funky, horny, funny and packed to the brim with summery hooks, all of which disguises an undercurrent of emotional pain fuelled by addiction. (Wolf spent time in rehab for alcohol in 2020.) She's even from California, just to really complete the picture.     Juno  channels those familiar characteristics through an extremely modern sound that blends the futuristic energy of hyperpop with a grab bag of soul and hip-hop. ""Quiet on Set"" has a clavinet riff that recalls classic funk, chanted hooks à la the Go! Team, and bawdy raps that reference ass-eating, ""2 Girls 1 Cup"" (don't Google it) and an ""orgy at Five Guys with five guys."" Wolf channels SZA's husky-voiced soul on ""Volkiano,"" there's a splash of doo-wop and girl group harmony on ""Anthony Kiedis,"" and ""Buzz Me In"" juxtaposes a story of romantic uncertainty against a bubblegum chorus that sounds like pure joy.    Wolf and producer Jared Solomon (a.k.a. Solomonophonic) pack every song with laugh-out-loud jokes and confetti blasts of brightly coloured synth-funk, but for all the modern bedroom pop accoutrements,  Juno 's greatest strengths are the raw materials of melody and lyrics. This is particularly apparent on closer ""Street You Live On,"" which places a chorus of pitch-raised harmonies atop a mid-tempo hip-hop beat. Wolf sings of a still-raw breakup, tempering her heartbreak with a beautiful hook as she admits, ""I avoid the street that you live on / You're a magnet pulling my feet and my head off / And I scramble my brain, wasting away / Looking for ways that I can avoid you / To pull the weeds, suck the venom."" It's gorgeous breakup anthem, perfectly embodying the way  Juno  manages to be both timely and timeless.

2021-10-20,Daniel McIntosh,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC","Ouri Offers Something for Everyone, from Electronic to Neo-Classical, on 'Frame of a Fauna'",,"Ouri 's first full-length feels more like a culmination than a debut. After all, she's coming into it with a deeper musical background than most. She started in France as a prodigious composer, training in piano, cello and harp from the age of five. She left home at 16, bound for Montreal, drawn to the electronic music scene — a far cry from her orchestral upbringing. She began producing and DJing, collaborating with local musicians, and developing a profile for the heavily textured mix of instruments, synths and found sound that coloured her first singles and EPs.    She quickly became a fixture of the city's bubbling music scene, participating in the prestigious Red Bull Music Academy Bass Camp and headlining Boiler Room events. On her debut album,  Frame of a Fauna , Ouri binds the layers of her musical history together in a dense fusion.      Fauna  stretches Ouri's ability for worldbuilding over a nebulous theme. While examining the shifts of life, death and trauma, she laces orchestral compositions with industrial fuzz and trip-hop. Opener ""Ossature"" combines Ouri's soft lilt over an amniotic heartbeat of a drum loop, eventually giving way to glitching textures.    Shades of  Frame of a Fauna  feel like a showcase of her skill to combine genres into an abrasive, heady mix. The development of the album was similarly transient, starting with recording sessions in London and Berlin, and persisting through births and deaths in her family. Moments like these are sewn into the narrative and emotional structure of the album, with Ouri probing the sweeps of fate as they move through her life. ""Shape of It"" sets Ouri's lyrics over trembling strings that build into an assured chorus as she recites the track's central mantra, ""I care for mine / that's what I find the most freeing / so I care for mine."" Vocals fade, the din of a crowd develops and a dissonant orchestra wraps everything with a gut-wrenching tailspin.    As usual, Ouri shines in collaboration. ""Odd or God"" sees fellow Montrealer Mind Bath trading vocals over a beat that seems designed to match his James Blake-esque vocals. This and the mobilegirl-featuring ""Too Fast No Pain"" see Ouri meeting features at their level, rather than the other way around. Both songs feel just a bit more streamlined than the others, perhaps colouring within the lines to accommodate for featured voices. It doesn't necessarily take anything away from any of the songs, but it begs the question of whether it's necessary at all. After all, we've seen other vocalists meet her on her level in previous instances, namely her 2017 collaborative EP with Mind Bath or with Helena Deland on this year's  Hildegard  album.    In all,  Frame of a Fauna  presents a compelling archive of Ouri's many musical personas. First-time listeners will certainly find somewhere to stand on her spectrum of sound, whether it be the Aphex Twin-influenced breakbeats or the alt-classical compositions. It's a nuanced encapsulation of her sound from underground DJ to fully-rounded composer.

2021-10-20,Owen Morawitz,9,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Every Time I Die's Ninth Album Gives a 'Radical' Edge to Their Dark Metalcore,,"Longevity and critical acclaim notwithstanding, it's a bold move for any musical outfit to label their new record  Radical . After all, using a term this symbolically-loaded can easily be viewed as an open invitation for polyvalent readings. Could it be an indicator of stylistic variance? A grand gesture towards progressive philosophy? Or merely a nod to '90s anachronism and Bart Simpson catchphrases?     For  Every Time I Die , the answer appears to be a little more nuanced. Their ninth studio album arrives five years after 2016's  Low Teens  — the longest gap between recordings of their career — and two decades since the release of their raucous 2001 debut,  Last Night In Town . Yet, in the fast-paced realm of heavy music, five years is practically an eternity. The distant past of 2016 appears almost quaint compared to the stark reality that birthed  Radical , one shaped by the dismal spectacle of four years of Trumpism, the tragedy and stasis of a global pandemic, and a divisive political landscape punctuated by rampant inequality, police violence, and social unrest.     The metalcore pioneers make this narrative influence apparent on the album's scathing lead singles. Beginning with the reflective ""Post-Boredom,"" the band pairs stomping rhythms with a monstrous hook — recalling the haunting oblivion refrain from ""It Remembers"" — as frontman Keith Buckley knocks back shot after shot of lyrical apathy with a chaser of resigned annihilation. The scorching ""Planet Shit"" has Buckley dragging racist cross-burners, flag-waving nationalists, and ""soulless hypocrites"" kicking and screaming to the guillotine. Shored up by a barn-burning southern-rock instrumental, the track eventually sharpens to a penetrating point: ""When all the lines that were drawn / Are washed away in the blood / The blade that cuts through their spine has good people on both sides.""     Much of  Radical  plays out like a compositional ""greatest hits"" for the Buffalo quintet, with returning producer and engineer Will Putney (Knocked Loose, Counterparts) rendering each performance in glorious detail: sludgy grooves and thrashy licks from axemen Jordan Buckley and Andy Williams (""Dark Distance""; ""Hostile Architecture""), scattered panic chords (""A Colossal Wreck""; ""Distress Rehearsal""), chaotic fusillades from new addition and former Norma Jean drummer Clayton ""Goose"" Holyoak (""Sly""; ""People Verses""), and a smattering of off-kilter, jackhammer breakdowns (""Desperate Pleases""; ""AWOL"").     Adding to Every Time I Die's already impressive list of coveted guest features (including My Chemical Romance, the Gaslight Anthem, Alexisonfire, Panic! at the Disco, Glassjaw, Fall Out Boy, the Bronx, and more), ""All This and War"" allows '68's Josh Scogin to exorcise himself over the top of a nihilistic party anthem, powered by stop-start transitions and larynx-shredding screams. With versatility in mind,  Radical  immediately pivots into the sweeping grandiosity of the plaintive ""Thing with Feathers,"" as Buckley and Manchester Orchestra's Andy Hull croon over ruminations on eternal life and divine light.     As a published author, Buckley has consistently brought a philosophical, literary bent to his sardonic lyricism and  Radical  is no exception. If  Low Teens  was the product of the frontman's brush with death and despair, then LP number nine is informed by denial, ego death, and the transformative potential of self-discovery. Tracks like ""The Whip"" and ""sexsexsex"" lend a dark, libidinal edge to Buckley's notions of pleasure and pain, interpolating Deleuzian masochism with the erotic desire for a ""Venus in fur.""     Meanwhile, ""White Void"" is positively Nietzschean in its existential cry for meaning (""By the time we saw the sun it had set / By the time I saw the light I was dead / You sing into the white abyss / The white abyss sings back to you"") and album closer ""We Go Together"" echoes  Low Teens  standout ""Map Change"" by embracing a sense of cosmic scale, daring to question the very fabric of reality itself. Taking a psychic inventory of all his flaws and self-destructive impulses, Buckley expands his consciousness to encompass all things: ""I am mother / I am daughter / I am the body, dead in the water / All points are in the center in a space that's never-ending.""     With one of the most uncompromising and sophisticated discographies in heavy music, it's hardly surprising that Every Time I Die move into their third decade of existence with an emphasis on refinement and range over unnecessary risks. Rather than fix what isn't broken,  Radical  finds the group doubling down and levelling-up their expansive, swaggering metalcore in every way possible.

2021-09-23,Mark Tremblay,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The Body and Big Brave Fly from Metal to Folk on 'Leaving None but Small Birds',,"On  Leaving None but Small Birds ,  the Body  and  Big Brave  — two of the most consistent and prolific acts in heavy music — have come together to create something completely unique to each other's catalogue. Both artists, known for creating walls of punishing sound and emotional contrast through distortion, have taken a stab at creating folk music.    Through lush instrumental arrangements and haunting vocals, these two artists have created a beautiful album through means previously foreign to them. While somewhat inconsistent,  Leaving None but Small Birds  is an attempt at daring creativity and emotional honesty that few heavy bands could conjure up.    The album opens with ""Blackest Crow"" and ""Oh Sinner,"" a pair of highlights that feature complex melodic arrangements and restrained percussion. Instead of walls of distortion, the listener is met with twangy guitars similar to those that soundtrack a Spaghetti Western. The typically bombastic-sounding drums are replaced with a range of much more subdued percussive instruments. For example, ""Oh Sinner"" fills out Robin Wattie's haunting croons of vengeance with piano and string arrangements, and moments like this on the record show how impressive it is that these bands can reach the same emotional depth of previous records through opposite means.    Not all risks pay off on  Leaving None but Small Birds , but the ones that do lead to spectacular results. A song like ""Hard Times"" unfortunately comes off a bit convoluted and redundant, and yet a song like ""Black is a Colour,"" further stripped down, may ultimately be the most rewarding song on the record. The lack of instrumentation really allows for Wattie's voice to shine, baring all of its emotional honesty. Fans of each band's brand of layered drone finally get a glimpse of it on ""Polly Gosford"" through a smattering of guitars, strings, and percussive instruments. Even the strained and non-sensical guitar leads throughout the song add to the emotional strain of the piece.    A kind of collaborative effort sorely needed in heavy music,  Leaving None but Small Birds  is a departure for both bands that results in a mostly positive and rewarding listening experience. This complete change in sonic construction not only introduces these bands to wider audiences, but also gives a glimpse of their greater musical potential moving forward.

2021-09-27,Kaelen Bell,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Tirzah Deconstructs Everything on 'Colourgrade',,"A lullaby ought to be soft and quiet, but its core objective isn't beauty so much as hypnosis — repetitive, beckoning, inescapable. There's a witchy danger to the very act of murmuring into the dim; an effective lullaby is an incantation that disarms and disappears you, a needle threading the seam between here and away.     Tirzah 's  Colourgrade  is a collection of such enchantments, a series of fractured cradle songs that push into the dark membrane at the edge of so many lullabies. The record is milk-stained, heavy-lidded, exceptionally patient and unconcerned with the outside world. It's almost voyeuristically intimate, alive with the uncontainable, earth-shifting, mundane love that tethers parent and child.    The record opens on Tirzah Mastin's voice, metallic and liquified as though she's speaking through a fan. The song is near-formless, a molasses-slow melody wandering in drowsy, imperfect circles. What words can be made out are tender and near-desperate, as though spoken in the grips of sleep — ""keep your face close."" And at the 1:25 mark, just as you think it's all about to snap into place — a drumbeat or bass will land as anchors, a guitar riff will pull melody from the haze — a drunken whistle appears instead, straight from a seaside carnival haunted house.    The title track never finds that anticipated footing, but it's clear that Tirzah and her small family of collaborators — Mica Levi and Coby Sey, most fundamentally — are not in search of such clean landings. Instead, they've created something wholly new, a record that eschews the deconstructed pop and R&B of 2018's  Devotion  for the essence of deconstruction itself.  Colourgrade  is irregular, in-process, as though it's being conjured second by second and remade each time you hit play.     In 2009, the Knife's Karen Dreijer released  Fever Ray , a record occupied largely by parenthood and domesticity that felt entirely mutant, a humid swampland of music that drenched routine in a slick of black oil.  Colourgrade  occupies a different season on the same planet, the brittle winter to Dreijer's muggy, sticky summer. Despite their metallic strangeness — and, perhaps magnified by it, as the alien chill forces you to pull closer to the warmth of Tirzah's words — these songs evoke love and devotion, raw and pink at their core. Atop the slow-boiling synth and stuttering drum of ""Beating,"" Tirzah marvels at the miracle of life itself, an ode to her partner and the child growing inside her: ""Found you / you found me,"" she sings sleepily. ""You got me / I got you / we made life / it's beating.""     Over the tooth-tingling plastic squeak and deteriorating guitar that sprawls lazily across ""Sleeping,"" she intones ""My baby / she's sleeping tonight."" Tirzah's words are often difficult to make out, but when she can be understood, she is direct, warm, dedicated: ""I hold you tight / so close, I hold you / I hold you tight.""     And sometimes, there are no words to be spoken at all. The record's centrepiece is the six-and-a-half-minute ""Crepuscular Rays,"" a wordless cloud of a song that finds Tirzah murmuring and humming within a crystalline tunnel of gently strummed guitar. If this sounds ponderous, that's because it should be. But in the hands of Tirzah and her collaborators, ""Crepuscular Rays"" transcends; words of love distilled to pure sound, it's every bit as illuminating as its namesake.     On first listen,  Colourgrade  may frustrate for its complete insularity and disregard for pop structure. Its decaying guitars, fractured beats and in-the-room atmosphere never cohere into anything as immediate as  Devotion 's ""Holding On"" or ""Gladly."" But it's an act of daring, making a record that feels so completely a piece of its creator's DNA, littered with the musk and skin and shadow and light of life.    And despite the gentle intimacy of the subject matter, the music itself is menacing, sensual, sideways and delirious and sometimes fearful. There's a destabilizing intensity to the trio's compositions, a complete lack of self-consciousness and a sense of total freedom, as though the record was made with no intention to release it at all. These songs aren't catchy earworms but ghostly parasites, burrowing into the folds of your brain and asking that you surrender yourself to their state of half-sleep.     On the cover, Tirzah flips through a children's picture book. Its page, caught like a wave mid-crash, blurs into the air, it's edges dissolved to nothing and painting the air pink and orange. This is  Colourgrade 's magic ⎯ it captures the quiet humdrum of life at its most unreal, blearing domestic love and childrearing and sleep and exhaustion into something suddenly, amazingly unfamiliar.

2021-09-29,Wesley McLean,8,"REVIEWS,FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,MUSIC",Andy Shauf Continues to Flex His Storytelling Strengths on 'Wilds',,"Andy Shauf  crafted something incredibly special when he put together his 2020 release  The Neon Skyline . The album was a tour-de-force for the Saskatchewan-born singer-songwriter, as he wrote, arranged and performed an album that felt more like he'd written, directed and starred in a movie. It was an incredibly cinematic offering that explored the complexities of human relationships and the emotions that go into and come out of them. Through that LP, Shauf created a vivid world with a colourful cast of characters and did so with an unrelenting charm that persisted through the story's highs and lows.    With  Wilds , Shauf returns to the world he created with  Skyline , delivering a selection of tracks recorded during that period that didn't make the cut, though this is far from being a B-sides or demos compilation. In fact, it's quite the opposite, as instead of feeling like a collection of deleted scenes from a movie,  Wilds  feels more like a proper spin-off series building on its foundation.    While the album doesn't share the same level of structured, deliberate storytelling that was present throughout the entirety of  Skyline , it does a great job presenting an anthology of shorter stories that expand on the world established on that album. With recurring characters and further exploration of the relationship between Shauf's protagonist and his soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend Judy,  Wilds  is a perfect companion piece to  Skyline , and manages to be so without feeling too similar or derivative.     Wilds  manages to deliver an experience that houses enough familiar faces and aspects to feel rewarding for returning fans but keeps the formula fresh enough for it to still feel new. This is due, in large part, to Shauf's brilliant songwriting and storytelling, as he once again showcases his innate ability to write these simple yet deeply affecting lyrics, putting the listener squarely in the protagonist's shoes and experiencing these tales right there with them.    On top of his prowess as a writer, how he delivers his lyrics and chooses to score them musically, perfectly captures the emotions that he is trying to relay. Moments like the sombre, stripped-back ""Call"" immediately grasp the listener as Shauf opens with the lines ""I want to hear your voice call / down the empty street / telling me to wait up / telling me anything"" over nothing but the soft strums of his acoustic guitar. In having his hand in all aspects of the creative process, he's able to present his stories in the most emotionally impactful and resonant way possible.    For an album comprised of songs that didn't make that cut when recording his previous project,  Wilds  feels incredibly well thought out and complete. It may lack the narrative strength and cohesion of  The Neon Skyline , but that's about the only thing that's lacking in comparison. Shauf delivers a collection of tracks here that showcase exactly what made  Skyline  so incredible, and in turn, what makes him such a captivating artist. Between this album,  Skyline  and 2016's  The Party , Shauf is on an impressive run, and it'll be interesting to see where he goes next.

2021-09-29,Chris Bryson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",Full of Hell's 'Garden of Burning Apparitions' is a Glorious Whirlwind of Extreme Music,,"Often the best extreme music — and perhaps much of the best art — comes from broken-down emotions, those fashioned from fear, pain, chaos, rage and the tortured and vulnerable spirit behind it all.    Maryland's  Full of Hell  have built a career within these spaces as grand prolific purveyors of cathartic sonic violence. Their last two full-lengths, 2017's  Trumpeting Ecstasy  and 2019's  Weeping Choir , and their collaborations with experimental metal duo the Body (2016's  One Day You Will Ache Like I Ache  and 2017's  Ascending a Mountain of Heavy Light ), are some of the wildest releases in extreme music, careening through noise, grindcore, hardcore, sludge, black and death metal, and imbued with hearts of darkness. Those twisted worlds presented Full of Hell as at their best when leaning into more diverse influences and creative directions, and cramming intricacies into already dense music.    For their new LP,  Garden of Burning Apparitions , Full of Hell have continued down a similar path to present some of their most remarkably jarring work yet. Full of Hell have always been a band requiring repeated close listens to truly take in the complexity behind the madness. With every release, they've remained close to their core influences while continuing to find ways to blend new depth into their sound, and  Garden of Burning Apparitions  is a finely crafted hellscape.    Produced by Machines with Magnets' Seth Manchester, this dynamic, uniquely flowing record hits devastatingly hard, and guitarist Spencer Hazard, bassist Sam DiGristine and drummer Dave Bland make blazing magic at ferocious speeds. Fans of the band and the genres they swerve through will have plenty to enjoy, as Full of Hell remain a jolting, mutating juggernaut. ""Guided Blight"" is an opening salvo in true Full of Hell form, with a minute-long grindcore assault of relentless screams, barks, blast beats and buzzsaw guitars, while ""Murmuring Foul Spring"" starts slow and expansive before ripping into chunky riffs and frantic staccatos and then dissolving abruptly after a momentous caveman showdown.    Throughout the record, vocalist Dylan Walker examines a variety of fears about existence, society and religion through dark, fantastical poetics employed with an expressive range of growls to high-pitched shrieks and strange contortions in-between, like the monstrous tones of ""All Bells Ringing,"" and ""Asphyxiant Blessing,"" where it aptly sounds like he's singing while pretending to suffocate before shifting into deep roars as the band drops into a crushing, doomy coda.    Clocking in at a whopping three minutes, the album's second-longest song ""Derelict Satellite"" feels like a more intense spiritual predecessor to  Weeping Choir 's similarly lengthy ""Rainbow Coil,"" featuring caustic distortion, muffled screams and harsh, metallic clanging in an immense wall of sound. It paves a fiery trail to the jarring mayhem of ""Burning Apparition,"" one of the record's standouts. Veering through monolithic riffs, searing guitars, death roars and bursts of grind, it's an absolute whirlwind of a track that's over much too soon, although probably appropriately so.    ""Industrial Messiah Complex"" evokes the album's title with fractured vocals that flitter like ghosts aflame, paired with whirling guitars and monstrous, heaving riffs. For ""Reeking Tunnels,"" Walker has cited Shellac and Cop Shoot Cop as influences, and the resulting potent noise rock groove is filled out with a grunted chorus and spiralling guitars that weave around deranged, sputtering, spectral chanting. ""Celestial Heirarch"" ends the album as if the band were completing a lively summoning, where a furious frenzy of shrieks, growls, drums and heady guitars reach a demolishing finale before descending into whirring electronics.    Versatility and variety remain at the crux of what makes Full of Hell so enthralling, especially when it comes to tempo and style, and  Garden of Burning Apparitions  is in no shortage. While scanning the state of the world and all its grievous, haunting wonders,  Garden of Burning Apparitions  continues Full of Hell's exploration of scorched earth, and by sticking to what they do best, they've left another bold stamp on extreme metal.

2021-09-30,Megan LaPierre,8,"ALBUM,EP,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Bestfriend's Tenderness Transcends Bedroom Pop on 'places i've lived',,"Bestfriend  is whoever you need them to be.     Holding up a mirror to the millennial psyche, the bicoastal duo consists of Stacy Kim and Kaelan Geoffrey — the former based in Vancouver and the latter Toronto. Their remote collaboration wields tender transmissions with ambition to transcend far beyond their respective bedrooms. On debut EP  places i've lived , they introduce themselves as your soft-spoken confidants, waxing nostalgic while scouring camera roll memories for a soft place to land amid the cracks in the pavement.    Geoffrey immediately establishes his promise as a producer on opening track ""You Want Everyone to Love You,"" a dense, pulsing soundscape that finds you speeding through a tunnel in the dead of night in a coming-of-age film. Ironically, Kim wryly accepts that making it to the moon is futile thereafter on ""Does It Matter?,"" capturing the day-to-day sense of impending doom while riding the escapist fantasy of a chance encounter on public transit.    She breaks through on the static-led ""Hannah in the City"" with her most assured vocal performance, ascending alongside its soaring chorus. ""Last Bus in the A.M."" finds referential guideposts in LCD Soundsystem's ""All My Friends"" while taking partying cues from Lorde in hollow ribs and shimmering synths panning from side to side: ""It keeps coming and coming in waves,"" Kim nearly whispers; in one ear, out the other.     Meanwhile, ""For Grace, After a Party"" — titled after the Frank O'Hara poem — is a lush, romantic moment complete with voicemail narration and the duo's cooing harmonies. If forced to choose between driving synth-pop jaunts and lumbering, dreamy ballads, Kim and Geoffrey comfortably sit on the fence.    Every song in the collection is a eulogy to something or someone from the past; places you've lived and people you've been. Bestfriend's reflexive intimacy is the kind that finds comfort in tweeting one's innermost thoughts; it often feels like listening to another kid profess their secrets through a cup on a string, as if you've known each other for years.    With foresight, the duo sees precious moments with loved ones through nostalgia's potent lens before they've even passed by. As retrospect would have it,  places i've lived  has softened edges — even when off-kilter tempo wobbles seem counterintuitive to where you think melodies are going, they come across as winking sleights of hand, working to throw the listener off the way time's passage can lead to unexpected shifts in perception.    The only track on the EP grounded in any semblance of the present tense is ""Good to See You,"" which asks to hold your hand in the meantime. Featuring gang vocals contributed by dozens of Geoffrey and Kim's friends, it's likewise not much of a stretch to imagine a crowd singing this chorus back to them despite the fact that Bestfriend has yet to make their live debut.    With the release of sister EP  places i've left  on the horizon, the nostalgia for an artistic beginning teeming with potential is probably being cued up as we speak.  places i've left  feels like it could be on the cusp of something remarkable — but for now, Kim and Geoffrey are just wondering what songs you'll listen to tonight as you walk home past the streetlights.

2021-09-30,Chris Gee,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Hovvdy's 'True Love' Is a Hopeful Embrace of the Present and Future,,"Often what makes us love a piece of music is the sense of nostalgia it can bring, the way an artist expresses love or sadness as an admiration of the past and a longing to feel those feelings once again. Austin, TX duo  Hovvdy  are no strangers to this, as their band is built upon hushed musings and tenderly strummed guitars while quietly pining for tiny flashes of comfort. Charlie Martin and Will Taylor would sing about fleeting sights on long drives in the country, staying up late with old friends, and living in the moments where every faded colour and swirled texture carries so much weight.     On their fourth album  True Love , Hovvdy have a rejuvenated outlook – their songs are a bit more hopeful and eager to bask in the warmth of the present, as they lift their heads from the lethargic reminiscence of their previous material. The title track is full of beaming guitars, fluttering at an exhilarating pace as Martin grins in the throes of a loving relationship, one that has always been there but now is being clearly celebrated as something beautiful and pure. The song is a sequel to Martin's ""Colorful,"" a melancholy song from Hovvdy's second album  Cranberry , but this time recalling the ""colorful houses"" and being ""tired from sleeping"" as positive, happenstance perceptions of his relationship's evolution, a path in which Martin is still walking on and learning from.     Both members of Hovvdy have gotten married since their last album  Heavy Lifter  was released in 2019, so it's not entirely surprising that they've written from a more romantic, familial perspective. On ""Hue,"" Taylor asks, ""Am I strong enough for two? Can I love me like I love you?"" in bewilderment of his new chapter in life. Later, on the dewy ""Lake June,"" he remembers, ""all in, moving backward at the wake of your first word,"" cementing in the overwhelming feeling of also becoming a father. Things are moving fast in Hovvdy's personal lives, but  True Love  cherishes their new experiences in the same special light as when they were fondly looking back at their youthful innocence.     Whereas  Heavy Lifter  and subsequent one-off singles ""Runner"" and ""I'm Sorry"" hinted at a more pop-centric direction from Hovvdy,  True Love  instead fully embraces the wistful yet hardy guitar strums and sparkling sense of rhythm that got them together in the first place.  True Love  feels like a return to their roots of making attentive, heartfelt music, but this time sounding bigger, cleaner, and brighter than ever before.    ""Junior Day League"" is draped in a vibrant glow, with crystal-clear acoustic guitars and Taylor's past shyness blossoms into an unblemished catchy melody while retaining his reposed tenderness of unwavering affection. Similarly, Martin's self-intersecting vocals on ""Blindsided"" still have his signature soft-spoken-ness but is enlivened by dancing pianos and a delightful reverence only hinted at in previous Hovvdy albums. The two songwriters have not missed a beat over the years and have only strengthened their ability to hold onto delicate memories and lay them down gently as is, letting each and every subtle detail shine and grow into sentimental treasures of truth and wonder.      True Love  is a loving snapshot of what Hovvdy holds dear in the present and their excitement for the future is infectious. Instead of reflecting on the past and easiness of simpler times, they are finding pockets of these hyper-elated feelings in the here and now. As Taylor sings, ""Memory won't let me take a picture, turn to me and tell me 'you'll remember'"" on ""Around Again,"" he reminds himself that life's grandest moments will always find their way to stay with us forever.

2021-10-04,Daniel Sylvester,8,"SOUL & FUNK,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,JAZZ,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",BADBADNOTGOOD Reconnect with Their Jazz Roots on 'Talk Memory',,"Since the release of their debut LP in 2011,  BADBADNOTGOOD  has always been associated with modern hip-hop culture, releasing Gang Starr covers, working with Post Malone producer Frank Dukes, and collaborating with artists like Mick Jenkins. But somewhere along the way, the band became less known for their rich and rubbery soundscapes and more for their beats and rhythms. On their fifth LP,  Talk Memory , BADBADNOTGOOD reconnect with their early jazz-fused influences for an album that shows the trio impressively finding the groove in the most intricate and intensive manner.    Their first release in five years, the Toronto band wholly forgoes raps, rhymes and vocals, rather looking to outside instrumentalists and composers who fit into the band's quest to craft a fully improvised and holistic set. Taking two years off before hitting the studio, BADBADNOTGOOD spent the next two years letting these songs gestate and slowly take shape in the studio — a departure from their typical routing of developing songs through energy-filled jams in front of audiences.    Much of  Talk Memory  builds like a live set, as the ambient, moody tracks build in tempo and funkiness as the album nears its conclusion. With the departure of founding keyboardist Matthew Tavares, bassist Chester Hansen and saxophonist Leland Whitty each take over the piano and synthesizer throughout the LP. This leaves to a more wandering and less structured sound, as apparent of the adventurous Floating Points-produced nine-minute opener ""Signal from the Noise"" and the formless jazz floater ""Timid, Intimidating.""    As the trio have forgone pulling together their dream list of guest vocalists, their choice of instrumental collaborators add to each song in the most enlightened manner. ""Unfolding (Momentum 73)"" features  Laraaji  on the electric zither and finds the band twisting their usual boom bap style to something more resembling cosmic jazz to suit the new age legend's playing. But what makes much of the album stand out from the rest of BADBADNOTGOOD's discography is the inclusion of Arthur Verocai. Featured on a third of the album's tracks, the 76-year-old Brazilian composer leads an 11-piece string orchestra to bring a truly cinematic sheen to tracks like the spaghetti western ""City of Mirrors"".    Pulling in hip-hop instrumentalists  Karriem Riggins  (""Beside April"") and  Terrace Martin  (""Talk Meaning"") help bring each musician involved and each sequence played to a completely new hemisphere. On  Talk Memory , BADBADNOTGOOD find likeminded collaborators ready to challenge and compliment them at every turn, resulting in a new evolution for the trio.

2021-10-04,Alex Hudson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Illuminati Hotties' 'Let Me Do One More' Is the One We've Been Waiting For,,"Last year's  FREE I.H  mixtape was subtitled  This Is Not the One You've Been Waiting For . The latest album from  Illuminati Hotties , on the other hand,  is  the one you've been waiting for: a pristine stunner, as songwriter-producer Sarah Tudzin goes for broke on 12 songs of impeccably crafted pop hooks, hyperactive crescendos and graceful comedowns.     Let Me Do One More  has been in the works for a few years, and was  largely written before  FREE I.H  (and before the pandemic). The songwriting here is more streamlined than the frenzied, bitesized blasts of  FREE I.H , although it's not necessarily more sedate. Just hear ""MMMOOOAAAAAYAYA,"" in which Tudzin warps her rubbery voice like she's Nicki Minaj in ""Monster,"" going from cutesy humming to sneering shouts and, at one point, cackling with evil-villain laughter.    But more often that not, Tudzin displays songwriting smarts rather than unhinged energy. Opener ""Pool Hopping"" is a twee pop ditty with summery lyrics about melty ice cream and ""peanut butter mouth,"" but its lyrics about sneaking into swimming pools are actually a metaphor for rebound hookups during a breakup: ""Dipping a toe into the deep end / Obtusely waving at a new friend / They said the water's warm / But I'm not sure if you and I are over, over, over."" Whispered ballad ""Protector"" captures the fragile calm of Big Thief — while a song featuring Big Thief member Buck Meek, ""u v v p,"" is a twangy '50s/'60s pop throwback. ""Kickflip"" features Tudzin's most gut-busting yells and a skronky guitar freekout, but only after two simmering verses to build the tension.     Let Me Do One More  is the first album on Snack Shack Tracks, the Hopeless Records imprint Tudzin started following the label drama that birthed  FREE I.H . As her own boss, she doesn't need to request ""let me do one more"" to anyone but herself — and across these 12 tracks, she quite literally owns every aspect of her sound.

2021-10-05,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Lil Wayne and Rich the Kid Invest in Each Other on 'Trust Fund Babies',,"From Method Man & Redman to Lil Baby & Lil Durk, rap duets at their best serve to elevate complementary talents and unify two strong fanbases. The release of  Trust Fund Babies  sees era-defining legend  Lil Wayne  teaming up with the industry-savvy  Rich the Kid , and this surprising combo yields unexpectedly solid results. Although their combination doesn't quite make sense on paper, the mixtape finds the rappers letting loose and quickly establishing a natural rapport right off the bat.    Lead single ""Feelin' Like Tunechi"" contains an interplay in the hook where each MC refers to themselves feeling like the other over a superbly selected beat. The way in which Weezy and Rich's vocal tones complement each other is immediately evident, and their unique deliveries gracefully coexist on the track. This rings true throughout the project, which is greater than the sum of its parts with both artists leaning into their strengths. Wayne's immaculate bars and wordplay add substance to Rich's expertly selected, dense and progressive production. This is why tracks like ""Headlock"" — which starts off a cappella and contains a complex, almost jarring, beat — can find the balance they need to be enjoyable.    While ""Trust Fund"" sounds more like a Rich the Kid song and the grimy ""Shh"" could be on any  Tha Carter  tape, the second half of  Trust Fund Babies  hits a sonic sweet spot that feels as effortless as a Wayne freestyle. Standout tracks ""Big Boss"" and ""Buzzin"" (of which the latter includes an excellent turn from YG, the mixtape's only feature) are extra smooth, while the more aggressive ""Still"" and ""Bleedin'"" never sound out of place. Album closer ""Yeah Yeah"" gives off the sensation of floating on a yacht that this whole mixtape aims for.     Rich the Kid has always had an ear for hit production, and has managed his own career as well as those of many who have come after him. However, his sales have been on a steady decline since his 2018 breakout,  The World Is Yours . Wayne has always garnered the cultural respect he has painstakingly earned, but label issues and release hiatus have garnered unattainable expectations for his diehard loyal fans. With  Trust Fund Babies , both artists can address the naysayers while having fun and focusing on the music. It's this visceral sense of relief and the quality of the bangers they cooked up that make this farfetched team-up much more than a throwaway mixtape.

2021-10-06,Adam Feibel,9,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die Balance Anger and Ambition on 'Illusory Walls',,"The world is an ugly place and we are constantly afraid to die! Billionaires retreat to mansions and yachts while millions of people toil below the poverty line, overworked and underpaid. Private healthcare insurers and pharmaceutical companies count their profits while patients go bankrupt in overcrowded hospitals or die of preventable disease. The rich enjoy endless comforts while the tired and hungry make impossible choices. It's the dirty secret of the American dream — the road to success paved with the blood, sweat and bodies of the poor.     The World is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die , ironically, deliver this message (paraphrased) more directly, exhaustedly and angrily than their name may imply. It's a message that rang even louder during the year they spent recording their fourth album  Illusory Walls ,  in the midst of a global event that unprecedentedly exacerbated and illuminated these systems of inequity, exploitation and unnecessary death. Consequently,  Illusory Walls  is easily the Connecticut-based group's most angry, cynical and hopeless record — but at the same time, it's also their most joyous, ambitious and hope ful  record.    This contrast comes up both lyrically and musically:  Illusory Walls  steps effortlessly between quietly contemplative, rambunctiously upbeat, furiously heavy and rousingly cathartic. Similar to recent efforts by Foxing and Manchester Orchestra, it's a sprawling, thematic rock record that finds TWIABP letting their ideas run freer than ever. While 2015's  Harmlessness  has frequently been held up as The World is a Beautiful Place's crowning achievement, that may soon change.  Illusory Walls  has to be the band's most diverse and dynamic work yet.    For one thing, the band's seething anger has brought out a previously hidden taste for metal. Lead single ""Invading the World of the Guilty of a Spirit of Vengeance"" is a six-minute storm of downtuned, distorted guitars, high-flying shredding and a pulverizing rhythm section as singers David Bello and Katie Dvorak rage against the rat race. ""Your Brain is a Rubbermaid"" is a dark, thundering march with a dramatic string arrangement, an ominous-sounding cut that could fit into a Russian Circles setlist or even the soundtrack to a suspense thriller.    At other times,  Illusory Walls  is remarkably vivacious. ""Never get better and never do anything,"" Dvorak sings with wry glee on ""Queen Sophie for President,"" a satirically sprightly power-pop tune that takes aim at the complacency of status-quo lawmakers. Later, the booming major key and easycore riffing of ""Trouble"" make it sound celebratory, even as the song pointedly laments the way that societal ills are treated as the failings of individuals rather than the product of a rotten system.    Miraculously, it all sounds like it's of a piece, thanks to a strong creative vision and a signature sound they've established over the last 10-plus years. Throughout this record, TWIABP display a finely developed sense for combining slow-burning atmospheres with explosive, propulsive power. There's a yearning mysticism throughout ""We Saw Birds Through the Hole in the Ceiling"" that persists even when they shift from steady ambience to quick, punchy riffs. And there's a haunting sadness to ""Died in the Prison of the Holy Office"" that remains even after its mounting suspense finally bursts into a frenzy as Bello tells of a character left to constantly, hopelessly struggle amid the false promises of drugs, religion and self-help gurus.    Then there are the final two tracks, which account for more than half of  Illusory Walls'  70-minute runtime. With a plaintively wandering bass line, playful synths and a perfectly placed xylophone, ""Infinite Josh"" is a fittingly sentimental mini-epic about watching time go by: ""Our dreams get drowned in a river of present needs / The years float by like fallen leaves."" And finally, the big finale ""Fewer Afraid"" feels like the emotional payoff of every The World is a Beautiful Place song they've ever recorded, recapturing some of the sound from their early years as part of a 20-minute post-rock odyssey complete with personal memories, universal truths, freestyle poetry, political satire and, finally, a splendid easter egg that should put a smile on the face of anyone who's been enjoying the band since their debut  Whenever, If Ever.  It's a magnum opus within a magnum opus, setting out TWIABP's ethos in four sentences — a collectivist message that better is possible, but only if we all work toward it together.     Illusory Walls  is a going-for-it album from a band that has never been known to hold back anyway. TWIABP are even more audacious than they were when they first emerged on the emo scene with a reputation for the grandiose and weird — their name, their song titles, their numerous band members and, of course, their music — but now they have more than a decade's worth of experience to make those grand ideas into a grander reality. On  Illusory Walls,  The World is a Beautiful Place give a lot and only ask for some of your time, patience and attention in return. At every interval, they make it worth your while.

2021-10-07,Adam Feibel,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The Honest Heart Collective's Inner Fire Burns Bright on 'More Harm',,"In December of 2017,  the Honest Heart Collective  were three hours out of their hometown of Thunder Bay on their way to play a show in London, Ont., when they hit a patch of black ice on the Trans-Canada Highway and, for a few very long seconds, thought they were about to die. Their van barrel-rolled into the ditch, turning it into a wreck of twisted metal and shattered glass. Mercifully, the band members themselves were mostly unharmed.    This near-death experience was, by all accounts, a transformative moment for the members of this independent rock 'n' roll band from northern Ontario. That didn't have time to reveal itself in the group's excellent 2018 album  Grief Rights  — which was already written and mostly recorded by then — but it weighs heavily here on their third effort  More Harm.  If your life can suddenly end at any second, how do you make the most of it right now?    ""Are we ever gonna get it right?"" Ryan MacDonald sings in the anthemic ""11/17,"" named after the highway that threatened to take their lives. ""I'll never forget when we ran straight off the road / In the dead of winter where even that night bled cold,"" he concludes. ""And I've never felt something so bitter before / But the funny thing is the cold doesn't bother me much anymore."" There's a resilience here that guides, but also a fight against a pervading sense of numbness that serves as the record's primary theme.  More Harm?  Bring it on.    ""I'm okay, don't you mind / Life's been great, I'm just tired / Though my eyes can barely hide that there's no fire,"" MacDonald sings in ""I Heard You're Worried About Me,"" another of the big, upbeat folk-rocky songs that are the band's calling card. It's not just him, either: ""Well you say you're fine / But I don't believe it,"" he sings a few songs later on ""Fine."" The band has always used raw feeling as a rallying cry. In classic Springsteen style, these songs are lyrically dark yet rousingly hopeful. They're imbued with pain, worry and the feeling of fleeting youth, but they sound like joy, belief and vitality. The Honest Heart Collective could be the  Ted Lasso  of Canadian rock 'n' roll, trying to put forward a brave face of comfort and kindness despite teetering on the brink of a breakdown. All of their energy is devoted to not feeling defeated.    In ""Linework,"" tattoos are a permanent reminder of the impermanence of young love: ""Though the ink may fade, our hearts stay the same / But it's a little too late now."" ""So what do you want the last thing that they say about you to be?"" he asks on ""Funeral,"" a power ballad set at the wake of a former partner's grandfather. Then there's ""If You Wanna Leave,"" an uncharacteristically sassy song about a lover who's become all too accepting of heartbreak. ""If you wanna leave, well there's the door,"" MacDonald howls as the band plays with the four-on-the-floor stomp of ""American Slang"" but also the bluesy swagger of Joan Jett, making it one of the band's most different (and therefore most interesting) songs in their set.    Produced by Derek Hoffman (Arkells, the Darcys, the Trews), who also worked on  Grief Rights ,  More Harm  is another short-and-sweet LP that caters to the Honest Heart Collective's strengths. They're drawing on a tried-and-true formula for heartland rock — think of the E Street Band or Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, but with the lingering punk-rock origins of the Gaslight Anthem, the Replacements and the Menzingers — complete with confessional lyrics, a rousing, rural twang and campfire chords amped up with the punchy crunch of a Telecaster. The band is sturdy and dynamic, and guitarist Kevin Heerema has a knack for riffing away without distracting from the melodic hooks.    It's also highly quotable, and for all these reasons the band should have no problem holding a crowd in the palm of their hands. The band's music might also come off as overly sentimental, but as  Norm McDonald once said , ""If something is true, it is not sentimental,"" and the band speaks hard truths more than they speak in platitudes.    Notably,  More Harm  closes a chapter in the Honest Heart Collective's story, as represented visually in the album's artwork: The fiery cabin was inspired by the old abandoned home shown on the cover of  Grief Rights,  which itself featured the denim vest from 2015's  Liar's Club  slung over a chair.

2021-09-14,Vish Khanna,9,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Bob Dylan's 'Springtime in New York' Reclaims His Most Written-Off Period,,"From a creative era that even  Bob Dylan  himself has suggested was fraught with self-doubt and a sense that all mastery of his craft was lost, we receive this remarkable treasure trove that demonstrates how hungry and impassioned he really was. It's a journey that begins with lovely, fun covers via studio band warm-ups, and reimagined versions of his own songs, perhaps just to draw heat from the incandescent spark of his past, followed by side-trips that yielded some of the greatest songs he ever wrote, some of which never even made it on to the most uneven albums of his career. Mixed-up confusion, for sure.     After converting to Christianity in the late 1970s, Dylan's music and infamous live shows of the time were thought to be a little judgy and hellfire-y, as the free-thinking boundary buster began to hector sinners and advocate for religious parameters. While it was generally assumed he'd created a trilogy of gospel records with  Slow Train Coming  (1979),  Saved  (1980), and  Shot of Love  (1981), he was purportedly perturbed that critics and fans connected  Shot of Love  to its predecessors, as he didn't see things that way; Jesus Christ was certainly invoked but, in general, the album's tone is less evangelical than the previous pair. In any case, he received the worst reviews of his life and it felt like the whole world was on his case so, fighter that he is, he went into his corner to figure out how he could dodge all of these jabs.      Springtime in New York  picks up this story in the fall of 1980, chronicling Dylan's remarkable creative process via 57 unreleased recordings of songs some of us know from other takes on previously sanctioned releases or bootlegged iterations, but most of which are fresh because they've been trapped in what was ""cutting edge"" but is now obsolete 1980s digital recording technology. The set draws from sessions for the aforementioned and maligned  Shot of Love , the 1983 ""comeback,""  Infidels , and the 1985 ""uh oh,""  Empire Burlesque , and it makes each record more fascinating than some of us have given them credit for. Far from a forlorn or lost artist, we hear Dylan in full vocal command, his imagination spinning the same song around in different arrangements, and putting his mind to future classics whose only fault lies within their creator's impulsive neglect (his confidence to make assertive decisions about album inclusions was shaky, even if his voice and mind were seemingly sure).     For fans of  The Basement Tapes  and also the ""Rolling Thunder Revue"" era of airtight looseness, the first two of these five discs are a fulfilling and bemusing romp — Dylan and his star-studded bands (in the course of this collection, we encounter contributions by Beatles, Stones, Heartbreakers, Sly & Robbie, Dire Straits, the E Street Band, and many more luminaries) playing with a kind of aimless joy during a good hang. After ramshackle-y runs on his own ""Señor (Tales of Yankee Power)"" and ""To Ramona,"" there are truly soulful and infectious takes of ""Jesus Met the Woman at the Well"" and ""Need a Woman,"" with background singers, Carolyn Dennis, Madelyn Quebec, and Clydie King, infusing such songs with character and inspiring Dylan to roar.     On covers like ""Mystery Train"" (featuring both Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner) and ""Sweet Caroline,"" Dylan replaces their respective galloping pep with a measured melancholy; indeed, this version of ""Sweet Caroline"" could be played at Caroline's funeral. These takes on ""Fever"" and Hank Williams' ""Cold Cold Heart"" draw upon the previously untapped heat and longing of their sentiments, Dylan digging deep, sounding like he's set to explode. It's a cool, deconstructive phase — Dylan reimagining classics and recent hits by others, like ""This Night Won't Last Forever,"" ""We Just Disagree,"" and the haunting ""Let's Keep it Between Us,"" in compelling and memorable ways.     Of course, such things will seem like larks for those clamouring for the great ""lost"" songs from this era, written by Dylan himself. In the excellent, invaluable liner notes, writer Damien Love traces the origins of jettisoned pieces like the raucous ""Price of Love,"" the  Desire -y ""Don't Ever Take Yourself Away,"" the down blues ""Fur Slippers"" (eventually covered by B.B. King in 1999), the rollicking and astounding ""Borrowed Time,"" the reggae-infused, low-key menace (Dylan's mid-song chuckle notwithstanding) of ""Is It Worth It?"" and soft-metal of ""Yes Sir, No Sir,"" and why they might've been left behind.     The original master take of ""Jokerman"" from  Infidels , among the great technological rescue missions here and an inarguably all-time great Dylan song, soars thanks to the rhythm section of Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, and swirling guitars by the Rolling Stones' Mick Taylor and — one of Dylan's key collaborators in this era — Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler. This momentous configuration spurred Dylan to reach for the sky and he touches it.     Meanwhile, ""Blind Willie McTell"" continues to live this mysterious life as a forgotten child that was inexplicably banished from  Infidels . After a stark, acoustic piano and guitar version appeared on  The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased 1961-1991) , fans were left awed, angered, and baffled. Ever since 1969's  Great White Wonder , rock's first major bootleg and a remarkable alternate history of Dylan's recorded output began circulating, some of his more obsessive fans engage in all manner of conspiracies about just what kinds of other songs and information the Dylan camp was keeping from the world. 2021 brings us this alternate, full-band version of the monumental ""Blind Willie McTell"" on this collection, which is gorgeous, plus yet another version that Third Man Records has pressed as a single. It's such a staggering, poetic song about America and racism and history, Dylan himself was shook by it, never feeling like he recorded it well enough to do it justice; with these unearthed versions, at least we're getting closer to receiving every attempt he made.     Indeed, the  Infidels  sessions include some of the most intriguing ""what if?"" scenarios for both Dylan and his fans, with songs that didn't make it out alive either being re-worked for its follow-up,  Empire Burlesque  (""Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart,"" ""Clean Cut Kid""), or transforming from one auspicious thing (""Too Late"") to another that was still tossed aside (""Foot of Pride,"" perhaps best-known for Lou Reed's live version at the 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration for Dylan in 1992).    Pondering what kinds of sounds Dylan could've chased, Love reflects upon the  Late Night with David Letterman  version of ""License to Kill"" included here, which featured Dylan backed by members of the Plugz, an obscure L.A. punk band: ""Among all the attempts people have made at creating their own 'ideal'  Infidels , the most ambitious might be by Canadian musician Daniel Romano, who in 2020 released a  cover version of the entire album done Plugz-style .""     For its part, this set also offers us an alternate tone and sound to Dylan's 1980s than we've come to accept, as his most awkward, out-of-step era between decades of genius. In an age where acolytes like Bruce Springsteen were lauded for dispatching artful, multi-layered socio-political songs, Dylan released tunes like ""Neighbourhood Bully"" and ""Union Showdown"" and was stung by not-altogether-inaccurate readings that suggested they were vaguely pro-Israel and pro-America, respectively, furthering chatter that because he was older, he was both out-of-touch and cravenly seeking relevance. To clarify, if not correct the record, versions of  Empire Burlesque  songs like ""I'll Remember You,"" ""Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love),"" and ""Emotionally Yours,"" have been stripped of their dated production elements and are now, suddenly timeless.       That's the greatest gift of  Springtime in New York : it turns one of Bob Dylan's most confusing sonic eras on its head, liberating all of this material from its time and place. Next to his speed freak mid-1960s snarl, Dylan's 1980s ""We Are the World"" nasal voice is the one that comedians and impressionists have latched onto for the most mockery. Their source material isn't quite at its most pronounced by 1985 but even more than that, this collection actually, and surprisingly, shows off Dylan, the singer and player, in one of his most commanding phases. The desperation of being dismissed and ridiculed in his third decade of public life propelled him to draw out the courage of his convictions and sink his teeth into, say, ""New Danville Girl"" and ""Dark Eyes,"" which close this set out and sound like a gunslinger rising to a disrespectful dare. With  Springtime in New York , Dylan and his archive custodians take on his most written-off period and re-write it, capturing its lost glory.

2021-09-15,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",J Balvin Recaptures the Reggaetón Crown on 'JOSE',,"After years at the top of the Latin music world,  J Balvin  has become a globally recognised name, collaborating with the likes of Beyoncé, Cardi B and Pharrell and even releasing his own signature Jordan sneaker last year. However, within  la industria , it appeared his Puerto Rican protégé Bad Bunny had surpassed him in terms of sales with his own deeply personal, musically experimental projects. With the release of Balvin's fifth solo album,  JOSE , he is on a mission to humbly recapture his seat on the throne — and undeniably succeeds.    Over the years, Balvin had developed a successful formula of blending international trends with his trademark reggaetón sound and encapsulating club hits and ballads into a neat conceptual package. With  JOSE , he takes a more freehanded approach and puts himself at the forefront of the album's musical direction by carefully curating each song's progression.    Previously, Balvin seemed satisfied to simply be with the times and he is leading the way once more with  JOSE . From opening track ""F40,"" Balvin announces the album will be taking more risks by way of a sudden tempo change and the inclusion of a self-aggrandizing speech from Latin trap legend Arcángel. ""Una Nota"" and ""Te Acuerdas de Mí"" share the same beat provided by Balvin's implacable production team of Sky Rompiendo and Tainy, but featuring two artists at opposite sides of the Latin music world, the former with newcomer Sech and the latter featuring the announced return of reggaetón veteran Yandel (who boldly asks, ""Remember me?"").    Where Balvin used to find himself, at times, bested by his flavour-of-the-month features, the Colombian has now taken the reins and holds his own on every collaboration. He sounds more comfortable than ever on the trap-tinged ""Billetes de 100,"" offering a solid contrast to the rugged Myke Towers verse, and he effortlessly outperforms crooner Ozuna on ""Pa' Guayarte."" Balvin still does what he does best in breaking new artists — such as Tokischa on ""Perra"" and Maria Bercerra on ""Que Mas Pues"" — but he proves he can hang with the legends too, like when he provides a sublime sonic setting for the legendary Zion & Lennox on ""Si Te Atreves"" or on the Skrillex-supported sleeper hit-in-the-making ""In Da Getto.""     The album's solo tracks standout including the trance-inducing ""Que Locura"" and silky ballad ""Fantasías."" But no reggaetón record would be complete without a posse cut — here, it's the remix of mega-hit ""Poblado"" featuring heavyweights Karol G and Nicky Jam, now joined by a crew of rising artists. Balvin also pulls off one of the most well-executed Spanish-English duos in recent memory on ""Otra Noche Sin Ti"" with R&B star Khalid.    JOSE's ambitious 24-song escapade neatly concludes with the genre-bending ""UN DIA (ONE DAY,"" featuring Dua Lipa and Bad Bunny, where Balvin proves to be taking risks the whole way through. With  JOSE , J Balvin offers stiff competition to Kanye and Drake's recent 20-plus song efforts with a far more consistent effort.

2021-09-16,Adam Feibel,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Crown Lands Craft Gloriously Epic Retro Rock on 'White Buffalo',,"Crown Lands  are really going for it. Formed in 2016, the Oshawa-based rock 'n' roll duo dutifully built up their profile with three EPs while touring in support of Jack White, Rival Sons and Coheed and Cambria. Then they made a big leap with their self-titled debut album in 2020, earning international press from  Rolling Stone,  the BBC and  Guitar World . They were named the breakthrough group of the year at the  2021 Juno Awards .    So, it's been a rewarding few years for vocalist and drummer Cody Bowles and guitarist Kevin Comeau. On the rise to rock stardom, they've all the while used their voices for activism. In their songs and interviews, they've been outspoken about Indigenous issues, as well as anti-Semitism and gender identity (Bowles is Two-Spirit and half-Mi'kmaq, while Comeau is Jewish). Their band name itself is a political statement, referring to territories controlled by the Canadian government: ""Crown land is stolen land and we are reclaiming it.""    But it felt like the band was still coming into their own. Lyrically and publicly, they were advancing important subjects. ""I don't play rock'n' roll to talk about rock 'n' roll, I play to talk about things that matter to me,"" Comeau has said. ""I don't need any more 'hey mamas' in my life."" But musically, it had all been done — you'd be forgiven if you had brushed them aside as another band of Led Zeppelin-worshipping retro rockers. Their  Dave Cobb -produced debut is a big, solid slab of thunderously fuzzed-out blues rock, competing in a market already cornered these days by Greta Van Fleet. If Crown Lands wanted to avoid being seen as a knockoff of a knockoff, and do more than coast off a Spotify algorithm, they'd have to do something that set them apart from their fellow nostalgists. With  White Buffalo,  they've done that.    Crown Lands frequently described themselves as ""the White Stripes covering Rush,"" but you'd have had to strain to hear the latter's influence. There have certainly been flickers of it in their music — most notably the first couple of songs on 2017's  Rise Over Run  EP — but it wasn't until  recently  that Crown Lands fully indulged in their Rush geekery. And boy, have they ever.     White Buffalo  is considered an EP, but it's actually longer than Crown Lands' proper ""album."" There's your first clue that a prog rock band is now in session. It's not like you need any other clues: the recording begins with the five-minute instrumental ""Inner Light,"" opening with traditional Indian sounds and chest-rattling synths before exploding into rock 'n' roll theatrics, evoking the cavernous, ping-ponging guitar work of the Edge and the pounding, swirling tom rolls of the late, great Neil Peart. Bowles and Comeau are gleefully pursuing their self-indulgent rock 'n' roll impulses, yet the songs aren't self-serving. Against all odds, they're gloriously epic.    ""White Buffalo"" is the third instalment in a trilogy of songs addressing Indigenous rights, following ""Mountain"" and "" End of the Road ."" Bowles sings about a spirit of resilience: ""And the sands of time will wash away the reign of the last empire / Standing tall we'll rise again / It's our time to take it back."" With its thumping, riff-heavy verses, anthemic choruses, hippie-folk interludes and determined message, it feels a bit like ""Carry on Wayward Son"" reworked for a younger generation living on amid the horrors of history.    The electrified version of ""The Witching Hour,"" first recorded for the band's acoustic EP  Wayward Flyers Vol. 1 ,  is huge, hooky and highly playable, channelling both the hypnotic psychedelia of Jefferson Airplane and the heavy-metal swagger of Guns N' Roses. The 13-minute epic ""The Oracle"" has Genesis-style keyboards, the devilish guitars of Black Sabbath (and a riff ripped straight from Wolfmother), the compositional complexities of Yes, and perhaps even a hint of the spiritual sounds of Buffy Sainte-Marie.    Of course, Crown Lands are mining the past in order to pave the way for their future. They've worked with producers Nick Raskulinecz, Terry Brown and David Bottrill, all of them one-time Rush collaborators. Bowles's huge, high-pitched voice evokes the likes of Robert Plant and Geddy Lee. Bowles and Comeau even look the part, their long, luscious brown hair blowing majestically in the wind and their vintage fashion culled from the streets of Haight-Ashbury and posters of Freddie Mercury. Crown Lands are making classic rock for a modern age — boomer music in a Gen Z world. But with the band's social conscience and their devotion to the power of the shamelessly epic, the music feels newer than it is. A cynic may be reluctant to admit it, but Crown Lands'  White Buffalo  is retro rock that's actually, legitimately exciting.

2021-09-16,Vish Khanna,9,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Sofa's 'Source Crossfire' Retrospective Unearths Foundational Canadian Post-Punk,,"Though  Sofa  bear the distinction of creating the first two releases to launch  Constellation Records , the band's five-year run was as incandescent as a firecracker and similarly, seemed to vanish in the same moment it left witnesses awestruck.     Now, to correct the record within their own catalogue and also offer Sofa's works to those who missed them, Constellation presents  Source Crossfire , the band's first-ever vinyl pressing (excluding their  New Era Building  single, a.k.a. CST 001), which showcases a truly powerful, yet rather obscure post-punk band immersed in a sound and tone that Montreal and hundreds of other cities' underground rock scenes had on the brain in the mid-to-late 1990s.     Sofa consisted of bassist Scott Clarkson, guitarist (and Constellation co-founder) Ian Ilavsky, drummer Keith Marchand, and singer and lyricist Brad Todd, who convened in Montreal and bonded over music they already loved or were exposed to by one another. Beyond the Birthday Party, the Bad Seeds and, for some members, art-y, pre-humongous R.E.M., other touchstones included Joy Division, Fugazi, Nomeansno, the Jesus Lizard, Drive Like Jehu, Slint, and Hoover among other American post-hardcore and noise-rock bands one might have encountered via labels like Touch and Go or Dischord at the time.     In spending time with  Source Crossfire , which compiles music from Sofa's self-released cassettes recorded in 1995 and their compelling full-length album, 1997's  Grey  (CST 002; CD only), some of the aforementioned inspirations are apparent. But, between Todd's abstract lyricism and theatrical, buried-in-the mix yowl of a baritone, Clarkson and Marchand's airtight foundational chemistry, and Ilavsky's squalls of noise and melody, Sofa simply stand out as their own thing.     What is that thing? Well, for five years, it was a shadowy, yet roaring force, broke as shit, playing $3 shows, barely surviving, and yet helping forge an ecosystem for marginalized art in a city that also featured a nascent Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the much-needed establishment of artist-friendly venues and recording studios, and the first hints of the innovative work of Constellation Records.     Sofa was there for all of it, ""paying dues,"" kicking against the pricks, and conjuring music that artfully confronted and reveled in its context. Whether thundering forth on pieces like ""Ch2Chi"" or ""Comma"" or moving bracingly, with the quiet menace of ""Current"" or ""Just a Walk,"" the band and its singer are masters of tension and release. The music has its drama and flows with an off-kilter certainty — full-on, frantic sprints give way to alluring, gorgeous ballads — which is the bed Todd lays in, often dispatching his dark, introspective poetry in haunting speak-singing, which can recall David Yow one moment, Dave Gahan the next (with their patron saint, Nick Cave, lurking about the whole time).     Ultimately, as a retrospective  Source Crossfire  feels like a story we either all slept on, or should've been nudged to read more closely. Given that Sofa broke up about a year after releasing and touring behind the well-received  Grey  in 1997, it's not really a surprise that they've barely registered as a footnote in North American music over the past 25 years.    But in listening to how fearless, dynamic, and confidently they played together,  Source Crossfire  is indeed a surprising discovery, revealing one of Canada's most astounding bands and presenting their work with the majesty it deserves.

This much has been evident since the moment her  2016 Sofar NYC performance,  a haunting delivery of her song ""My Mind,"" went viral. Since then, armed with just a handful of material, she's captured the attention of everyone from Ed Sheeran to A Tribe Called Quest and left millions of listeners eagerly anticipating her studio debut. Such high expectations can be daunting, but on  Dawn,  Yebba performs with the self-assurance of an artist with nothing to prove.     Named after her late mother, who died by suicide shortly after that breakthrough performance in New York,  Dawn  is a brave and incredibly vulnerable tale of loss, grief, and healing. Personal and purgative, it plays like the pages of Yebba's diary; a private reflection where we, the listeners, play the role of bystanders. She opens the album with ""How Many Years,"" a stirring intro on which the Arkansan singer weathers the ebbs and flows of her grief.    Yebba embraces each emotion with raw candor, sifting through anger and resentment on ""Louie Bag"" (featuring Missouri spitfire  Smino ), and finding respite from her pain on the dance-tinged ""Love Came Down"" (which features co-production from Montreal's  Kaytranada ). ""October Sky,"" the album's centrepiece, is an engrossing piece of storytelling where Yebba recalls childhood memories of launching bottle rockets — leftover experiments from the high school science class her mother taught — into the autumn air.      Mark Ronson  handles the bulk of the production on  Dawn , and he and Yebba continue to be a formidable team. While it's reductive to compare her to Adele or Amy Winehouse, Ronson does pull whispers of the work he's done with those two artists out of Yebba's performance, especially on the hip-hop leaning standout ""Far Away"" (featuring  A$AP Rocky ) and the punchy, menacing revenge fantasy ""Boomerang.""     But of course, the crown jewel on this album is Yebba's remarkable delivery. Vocally, she is limitless; there is no sonic challenge too great. Throughout  Dawn , she exhibits wit and exemplary control and the blurred genre lines on the album are her playground. She can draw emotional, gospel-tinged growls from her gut at will; brighten and bend her voice around a glossy pop groove with ease; and, on a dime, can pull back and tip toe onto delicate ballads like ""Paranoia Purple,"" the album's tear-jerking closer. Yebba has an enveloping voice, the kind one could happily get lost in.

2021-09-17,Jordan Currie,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Lil Nas X Is No One-Trick Pony on 'MONTERO',,"When Montero Lamar Hill burst onto the music scene as  Lil Nas X  in 2018 with  ""Old Town Road,""  his country-rap song about cowboys and horses, most people thought of him, like the track itself, as a funny passing fad, a meme that would eventually fizzle out, a one-hit wonder. But as his witty social media presence and elaborate music videos and visuals grew, so did his sound and talent. Two years later, Lil Nas X has finally given birth to  a beautiful baby , and it shares a name with its parent:  MONTERO .    After ""Old Town Road"" picked up traction on social media, became a staple in memes on Twitter and TikTok and was re-released by his new label home of Columbia Records, Hill was catapulted into the public eye, collaborating on remixes with the likes of Billy Ray Cyrus and Nas. After cobbling together his debut EP  7  to mixed reception, Hill decided to take his time on the follow-up, working on the project for over a year.  He's likened the process to therapy , where he learned to let go of people's perceptions of him — after all, as an out and proud gay, Black artist, Hill is no stranger to conservative backlash. With producers like Omer Fedi, Roy Lenzo, Take a Daytrip and Kanye West as well as star-studded features,  MONTERO  lives up to its  wild   marketing   campaigns  and is equally as heartfelt and dark as it is bold.    It's evident within the first few tracks that  MONTERO  heavily explores themes of queer love and heartbreak, Hill's adjustment to fame, his earned pride in his accomplishments, and reflections on his life before he was Lil Nas X. The titular ""MONTERO (Call My by Your Name)"" was teased by Hill months before it was released as a single this year, with Hill casually sneaking snippets of it into videos on social media. Its infectious Spanish guitar licks and proclamation of brazen queer desire proved to be worth the wait and serve as the perfect opening track on its namesake album. It's followed by the Olympic-opening-ceremony-sized trumpets of ""Industry Baby,"" where Hill and special guest  Jack Harlow  sound like they're having an absolute blast.    Hill is no one-trick pony. An array of musical influences are on display here, as seen in the inclusion of a gospel choir on ""DEAD RIGHT NOW,"" which is downright heavenly on the ears. ""Lost in the Citadel"" looks back at a failed romance and has an energizing pop-rock energy, making it a unique stand-out on the tracklist and another showcase of Hill's versatility.    Along with Harlow, a handful of features appear throughout, the strongest of which is ""Scoop"" featuring  Doja Cat . It's impossible not to move when hearing the glossy, plucking strings and booming bass. Doja's cheeky, snappy bars and squeaky voice slide in smoothly, the pair almost sounding like musical siblings. ""DOLLA SIGN SLIME"" featuring  Megan Thee Stallion  brings back the triumphant horns, and Meg's brazen line of ""I should have my own category in porn"" is satisfying to no end. (On the other side of the feature spectrum is  Elton John 's appearance on ""ONE OF ME,"" in which he doesn't sing, and his piano playing is only noticeable at the very beginning and end of the track.)    As funny and charming as Hill's persona is online and in interviews, the last five songs on  MONTERO  take a dark, introspective turn, showing the lonely, anxious, self-doubting side that he's largely hidden from the public. On ""TALES OF DOMINICA,"" he explores his anxieties surrounding becoming more independent and imagines living alone on an island. On ""SUN GOES DOWN,"" he looks back at the racism and homophobia he faced in his adolescence, ultimately finding hope as he looks toward the rest of his life: ""I know that you want to cry / But there's much more to life than dyin' / Over your past mistakes / And people who threw dirt on your name,"" he croons. The unadorned plucking of a lone guitar and Hill's hurt-filled vocals on ""VOID"" proves he can pen sombre, heart-wrenching ballads in addition to the grand singles he's known for.    The album closes out with ""AM I DREAMING,"" a forlorn duet in which  Miley Cyrus 's trademark raspy vocals provide a nice contrast against Hill's smoother tone. Still, it would have been nice to end on a higher note after a period of so much darkness, and the final line of ""Never forget me and everything I've done"" followed by the sound of splashing water has some sinister implications that will no doubt be analyzed by fans. The abrupt tonal shift on the latter section of  MONTERO  sounds like a different album to the album's opening half, almost as though it could be its own separate EP. But even if it doesn't quite fit, it impressively showcases Hill's vulnerability in his storytelling.    With all eyes on Hill, and his ambitions as a serious musician in question, he gives a definitive answer on  MONTERO . He proves that he is a fully-fledged, multifaceted person who can do it all, and has all the makings of a modern yet ever-evolving pop star. He just remembers to have a fun, honest time while doing it.

De Augustine has released three albums, including his standout 2019 record  Tomb , and Stevens has a fulsome back-catalogue that includes everything from  Convocations , a 49-track ambient/electronic album released earlier this year, to 2004's lo-fi, banjo-filled folk record  Seven Swans . While  a pair of singles released in 2020  previewed the duo's sparkling connection, their first collaborative LP,  A Beginner's Mind , confirms that they are a musical match made in heaven.     A Beginner's Mind  is a collection of folk songs loosely inspired by films the duo have watched together which range from  All About Eve  to  Mad Max . (Their label, Asthmatic Kitty, wrote  a handy Twitter thread  of all of those movies for those curious, and the musicians were at one point offering a  Beginner's Mind  ""Movie Club Completist Pack,"" includes a Movie Club ID card, although its purpose is a mystery and the listing has since been removed.)    Fittingly, the album has a dusting of Hollywood glam. ""Lady Macbeth in Chains"" and ""Back to Oz"" have a similarly entrancing and sunny groove to them as if they've spent too long under the LA sun, and ""The Pillar of Souls"" and ""Lost in the World"" offer the most cinematic points of  A Beginner's Mind  what with their orchestral waves of melancholy. But lyrically, the album's 14 songs do not burst with screen-ready narratives, nor does listening to the record feel like browsing the racks at Blockbuster (RIP). Instead, the pair's songs are filled with the emotive poetics that they both excel at.    On each song, Stevens and De Augustine exchange parts with ease and nobody ever controls the spotlight. For Stevens fans who may appreciate his spells of electronic-focused experimentations but ultimately miss the heartache that's unique to his folksier material,  A Beginner's Mind  has what you're looking for. ""It's Your Own Body and Mind"" has a steady guitar melody that's reminiscent 2015's  Carrie & Lowell , as does ""Olympus,"" which also has Stevens and De Augustine perfectly braided together as they sing about love. De Augustine, meanwhile, dazzles as lead vocalist on sprightly songs like ""Fictional California.""     A Beginner's Mind  will not wow you with grand theatrics but it will have you on the edge of your seat nevertheless. In the last breaths of the album's final track ""Lacrimae,"" Stevens and De Augustine come together to quietly ask, ""…why must this life be so cruel and shadowed in the gloom?"" and then the house lights come on.

2021-09-21,Tom Beedham,9,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Mas Aya's 'Máscaras' Is a Rewarding Sonic Revolution,,"How do you touch the present? That might have been the single question guiding Brandon Valdivia's newest  Mas Aya  record,  Máscaras  (""Masks"") — or perhaps more finely: how do you touch another country's present, when there's nearly six thousand kilometres between? A dialogue of sorts with Valdivia's homeland of Nicaragua,  Máscaras  answers that question with deep, active listening.    In its first seconds, opening track ""Momento Presente,"" (""Present Moment"") features a meandering tin whistle, a skittering beat, the chime of a bell, and other percussion elements trickling, rattling, revealing themselves for a moment to be reckoned with, then retreating, leaving it up to the listener to follow them into the fray, pick up on another element, repeat. ""Right now, the oppressors and the oppressed are being separated,"" an unnamed Nicaraguan Sandinista guerilla declares in Spanish. ""We're not going to wait 2000 years for the good ones to be on one side and the bad ones to be on another. We are living in that moment now.""    The speech is sampled from a late 1979 guerrilla gathering around liberation theologist Ernesto Cardenal, and  Máscaras  returns to the subject of Nicaraguan revolution throughout. On ""18 de Abril"" the repeated short, but united blasts of a chorus of flutes resemble a people's siren. The track title refers to the first day of the 2018-2021 Nicaraguan protests, when demonstrators in several cities throughout the country protested president Daniel Ortega's introduction of social security reforms that increased taxes while decreasing benefits.     Of course, effective political movements cannot simply be reactive, so Valdivia fills these compositions with textural complexities, infinitely rewarding active listening and meditation, and anchoring scenes of revolution to a secular spirituality that could move mountains.    ""Key"" spouts short, warm synthesizer phrases while wind sounds distort, loop, pile on each other and a loose drum patter ambles along, departing from the rush of the opening track's busy immediacy — maintaining their autonomy, together: in collaboration, different sounds can overwhelm, but also heal. As Valdivia builds stillness to a beat on ""Villanueva,"" calm winds, speckles of electronics, and a distorted kick at first distinct enough to follow both simultaneously, then coming together, building something new.    Featuring a guest appearance from  Lido Pimienta  in a quieter mode than her solo work, ""Tiempo Ahora"" (""Time Now"") feels like a reaffirmation of these themes, urging listeners to make time for change; the future depends on it. Enchanting the listener to absorb it in different focused contexts is itself a pied piper political gesture, leading listeners away from capitalism's constant toil, beckoning them to retune their own perspectives in the space of its cycles.    This music is meditative in its truest sense, and Valdivia's juxtaposition of revolutionary politics and a lateral spirituality (one directed inward and horizontally rather than in deference to a grand hierarchy) is a revelation the left the world over could learn from, maybe even fuel a counter hegemony with.    At the same time, the record's psychedelic take on traditional sounds avoids folky pastiche, lighting a new path forward through rich environments of activity, imagining new futures for traditions that are being aggressively gentrified.

2021-09-21,Kaelen Bell,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Ada Lea Magnifies the Little Details on 'one hand on the steering wheel the other sewing a garden',,"That neighbour on the corner — the one that's seen you stumble home seasick in the wee hours of the morning, that's watched quietly as you water your long gone tomato plants or wash streaks onto your windows — how is it that you don't know their voice? That cat too, the one that comes around in the evenings without a collar or any sense of fear, where does she live when the sun is out?     Alexandra Levy's latest record as  Ada Lea ,  one hand on the steering wheel the other sewing a garden,  makes you wonder these things, the kind of music that illuminates the great big universe that can exist in a web of city blocks.     The record isn't necessarily  about  Levy's neighbourhood, but it's referenced directly, lovingly, several times; on ""can't stop me from dying,"" she's infatuated not with the person laying naked in her bed, but with the intersections of streets and people and happenstance that steered them to it  — ""I'm in love with my neighbourhood.""     The record is pressed at from all sides by the places that inspired it, navigating knotty relationships — with others, with yourself, with the world at large — with its feet planted firmly on the streets and fire escapes and creaking floors that host all our smallest triumphs and most humiliating collapses. In the tumbling drums of ""partner"" there's a warm, wine-pickled party that spills onto the lawn; in the low-riding, suspicious saxophone of ""can't stop me from dying,"" a moment of strange eye contact through a caulk-rimmed apartment window. In the world of  one hand,  the humdrum becomes everything, our small relationships and unexplored street corners suddenly rendered with weight and meaning.     Levy's writing is both insular — her lyrics are dense and singular, her references specific and sometimes unknowable — and insulating, sketching her surroundings so vividly, so minutely, that a city can feel as familiar and often-unpredictable as the inside of your own head.     Over the rung-climbing guitar of ""oranges,"" the visuals ooze steadily like honey — humming ash trees, crowded ash trays, stains, wild oranges, raspberry coats, red wine, concrete, bodies leaning on door frames and city parks in the daytime. The way Levy spits out ""your bed positioned so the sun rises to your left and a bible of sorts lies to your right,"" words nearly tripping over themselves as the music plods beneath, is like an incantation — it paints a picture so quickly, so easily, that you'd swear you could feel your left side warm as the sun breaks the morning.     That sunlight, too, is an integral piece of  one hand  — the whole thing glows with a particular late-summer energy, its precise, golden hour arrangements hinting at the wide-open chill of fall. It slants and spreads like sunlight in the corners of the yard, breaks and glitters like mid-day beams on high windows. And while the record is strongest the further she leans from what would be considered ""folk,"" Levy covers a wide swath of influence here — the heaving churn of ""my love 4 u is real,"" the fluttering ""writer in ny,"" the fingerpicked bob of ""saltspring"" — without disrupting the sway of shadow and light.     In reality,  one hand  covers a wide geographical range — New York, Montreal, Saltspring Island, places alluded to but never spoken aloud — but it still manages to feel like a diary of home, a peek into all the places that you know and those you don't know just yet. It's an album made for slipping down a side street and realizing, suddenly, that for all the years you've lived nearby, you'd never walked it before.

2021-09-22,Rhys Juergensen,9,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Poppy Digs Into the Entire Rock Canon at Once on 'FLUX',,"Poppy  has changed her musical style. Again.      When Poppy introduced herself to the world with debut album  Poppy.Computer  in 2017, the singer gave us neon-bright pop songs that reflected (and satirized) the digital culture through which her persona was built. With her second studio album, 2018's  Am I a Girl? , Poppy started dabbling with heavy songs: ""X"" and ""Play Destroy"" fused candy-pop and thrash in a style reminiscent of Japanese kawaii metal.      When Poppy's partnership with producer Cory Mixter (aka Titanic Sinclair) ended after  Am I a Girl? , her exploration of metal continued — and culminated — in 2020 album  I  Disagree  and this year's  EAT  EP, both of which are avant-garde explosions of heavy metal and gritty industrial, frequently juxtaposed against Poppy's classic, sugary sweet pop melodies.      After enjoying critical acclaim for this unique sound, Poppy decided it was time to move on. Earlier this summer, she dropped singles ""Her,"" ""Flux,"" and ""So Mean,"" three pop-grunge songs that drive home catchy hooks to which listeners can sing along after the first listen. The rest of the songs on  FLUX  follow a similar pattern: moving away from gimmicky, shock value approaches to song writing, she maintains a more traditional form. In vast contrast to her work on  I Disagree  and  EAT , almost all the tunes on  FLUX  follow standard verse-chorus-bridge construction. In some ways, this record is Poppy's most commercial work to date.      The song ""Hysteria"" draws on tense post-punk; the shoegaze, space-trip soundscape in ""Strange As It Seems"" seems to be a love letter to Billy Corgan's work in the early '90s; and ""Lessen the Damage"" is a throwback to '80s punk. But every genre and convention from which she borrows is refurbished with a Poppy twist.      First, there's the vocals. Fans of Poppy's heavier work may be disappointed by the fact that  FLUX  contains none of the purely animalistic screaming of  I Disagree  or  EAT . But on top of clean vocals, in the crescendo of songs like ""Her,"" ""Flux,"" and ""Never Find My Place,"" Poppy adds a layer of ""soft"" screaming — something between being in key and making noise. Then there's the lyrical content. Perhaps not a ""concept"" album,  FLUX  is still unified under the central theme of self-understanding, through Poppy's reconciling of personal identity with the world's perception of her.      She begins the journey of self-discovery on the title track, wherein she takes stock of her musical career to this point: ""For your amusement, for your confusion / I guess I'll do it 'cause I'm bored / There's no attention span shorter than mine or yours."" Poppy's journey also takes her to a moment of existential questioning — ""how did I get here?"", she sings on the third track, ""So Mean."" Eventually, the journey concludes with self-acceptance: ""I will be fine if I never find my place,"" she sings on the aforementioned closer.       FLUX  situates itself in and around the broad category of rock and its derivatives, but what it really does is encapsulate Poppy's desire to evolve through genres. She's identified that her constant need for change — for flux — is, ironically, the very thing that gives her consistency. With this album, Poppy very clearly says that her new niche is to not have a niche.

The eleven-track album is sure to please those who love the Saskatoon outfit's staple surf rock tone, as well as those who are ready for further musical exploration from the sister trio.     Ahead of  Get Thee to a Nunnery 's arrival, singles ""Sintaluta"" and ""It's Over"" showed off more pop-focused groove and ear worm harmonies. With a more apparent focus on vocals than their previous work, these two tracks spotlight the dreamy three-part harmonies the band is known for.    The drums are super tight, the bass line never fails to get the groove going, and the guitar holds so much colour; it's sometimes hard to imagine how there's room for vocals. Having played together their entire lives, the Garrys do an impressive job balancing the bright guitar with soft and dark vocal tones.     If you're looking to hone in on the trio's creative writing, look no further than ""In the Dawn"" and ""R.M. of Wolverine."" Neither track shies away from heavy harmonies or dissonance, making for an intensive listen, while slower tempos allows the vocals to set in deeper and envelop the song entirely. The latter comes at the end of the album and leaves the listener feeling contently somber and satisfied, straying from the bright surf rock tone for a lean towards a Western sound that fits seamlessly with the trio's voices.      Get Thee to a Nunnery  finds the Garrys confidently playing with genre without losing their core, proving the sister trio do not fail to intrigue listeners through their experimentation.

2021-09-03,Louis Pavlakos,6,"HIP-HOP,FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Nelly Brings Rap-Country Twang to the 'Heartland',,"There was some understandable skepticism when  Nelly  announced  Heartland , his newest album that's more country than anything he's put out so far. Nelly's first foray into proper country music came in 2004 when he collaborated with Tim McGraw on ""Over and Over"" a song that dominated the country charts, peaking at No. 3 on Billboard's Top 100. He then dabbled with country music again in 2013 on ""Cruise,"" featuring  Florida Georgia Line . Despite this success, fans who'd grown up on his anthems like ""Ride wit Me"" and ""Country Grammar (Hot Shit)"" didn't embrace it.    Luckily enough, there's not one song on  Heartland  that sinks to the level of ""Cruise."" A second collaboration with Florida Georgia Line, ""Lil Bit,"" is catchier and far less annoying. The country-tandem of Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley are relegated to hook duties, keeping their presence to a welcome minimum. Nelly, on the other hand, sounds right at home on the track. Even if the lyrics aren't exactly ear-shattering (""From the front to the back, hip-hop or the hoedown / Got the game on the go route / I'm the black Tom Brady in this, I'm the GOAT now""), the track is a clear-cut example of how comfortable Nelly sounds exploring his country sound.     Heartland 's brevity is what makes it as palatable as it is. Across its nine tracks, Nelly rarely ever sings with a signature country twang. He raps as normally as he would, it's just the instrumentation that leans more into the conventions of modern country music. Sometimes it works, like on ""Grits & Glamour,"" the album's centrepiece, featuring  Kane Brown . Similar to ""Lil Bit,"" it lacks on the lyrical front (""I'm a straight shooter like my last name Curry / Too many hoes, I got thirty under thirty"") but makes up for it with Brown's sticky hook and twangy vocals. It's far more a pop-rap song than it is full-fledged country, but it should be the song that sticks with Nelly's traditional pop fanbase.    Nelly succeeds on the album when he's making radio-friendly bangers. On ""High Horse"" with BRELAND and Blanco Brown, he's at his best. The allure of the track, however, comes from the guests who make the song as Southern-sounding as it is. In fact, most of what makes sound  Heartland  authentic are the guests, who've spent their lives making proper country music — Nelly's just tagging along for the ride.    While the first half of  Heartland  is the rodeo, the second half is the aftermath. On ""Someone Somewhere"" and ""Follow Me,"" Nelly sounds like he fell asleep at the wheel. The uplifting nature of the tracks seems better on paper than it is in practice. The songs' respective guests, George Birge and Chris Bandi, don't add anything other than a Southern voice to make the song sound, well, country.    Surprisingly, the only track on the latter half that doesn't sound like a throwaway is the one Nelly handles by himself, ""5 Drinks Ago."" He sings with a vulnerability that isn't seen anywhere else on the album (""And that was five drinks ago, five drinks ago / When you were just somebody that I used to know / When I was thinking sober, we were good and over""). It's unfortunate that it's buried between the worst songs on the short project, because it's the only track where the St. Louis legend shows he can make decent country music by himself.     Heartland  probably won't make a mark outside of major cities in the U.S., but it's still Nelly's best album in over a decade, mainly because it takes risks he hadn't taken since his  Country Grammar  era. It may be far from perfect, but a reinvigorated Nelly is a welcome addition to an already stacked year in hip hop.

2021-09-07,Adam Feibel,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,PUNK,MUSIC",Bad Waitress Display a New Type of Rage on 'No Taste',,"With their debut album,  Bad Waitress  mark their unofficially official arrival to a punk rock scene that's already begun to embrace them far and wide.  Originally formed as the Nude Dogs , the Toronto band earned early praise from Daniel Lanois and Metric's Emily Haines after releasing their first EP in 2017. They went on to rework their lineup, change their name and release six short rippers as  Party Bangers: Volume 1  the following year. They've since shared stages with the likes of Fucked Up, L7, Rise Against, Hollerado, Wolf Parade and the Bronx, making appearances at the Fest, NXNE, Pouzza Fest and other punk rock proving grounds.    Bad Waitress's music has been compared to early punks like the Damned, the Stooges and Fugazi, as well as garage rockers including the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Jay Reatard. You can also file them under ""riot grrrl revival,"" their songs adopting both the early-'90s punk rock sneer and fearless feminism of Bikini Kill and their peers.    Now, with  No Taste , they've leaned into the noisy, bottom-heavy styles of Sonic Youth, METZ, White Lung and IDLES. In marked contrast with the  Party Bangers  EP, these aren't what you'd call party bangers at all — more like the soundtrack to a violent brawl in a dark alleyway. Their sound here is crammed from top to bottom with Nicole Cain's chunky bass, Moon Palmar's thumping drums, Katelyn Molgard's searingly dissonant guitar work and Kali-Ann Butala's vocals that run the gamut from brusque shouts to snide yelps to pointed melodies to contemptuous murmurs.    Of course, it still feels like they're smiling while they spit in your face. With the booming track ""Delusions of Grandeur,"" they lay out their disgust for politicians' disregard for the working class with something between wry snark and pained fury. The catchy horror punk of ""Strawberry Milkshake"" parodies the pop cultural obsession with sex and candy; think of Katy Perry's ""California Gurls"" reimagined as a grindhouse flick (or, as the band puts it, ""an all-American beauty pageant with buckets of blood as the cherry on top"").    Throughout  No Taste , the rhythm section is consistently pulverizing, the guitars frequently squeal like air-raid sirens, and Butala's voice cuts like a blade. And while she hacks and slashes her way through these songs, the group's backing vocals sound deliberately empty-eyed. ""Manners"" sways to the dutifully repeated tick-tock of ""Sit up straight / Good,"" laying a rhythmic framework for the song's satire of the wealthy and powerful. In ""Strawberry Milkshake,"" they chant with such a disaffected tone that the sugary-themed song leaves only a bitter taste. On ""Standards,"" the crew sings entire verses in a lilting, sarcastic mumble (""I don't speak too much / I don't cause a fuss"").    More broadly, Bad Waitress's music is designed like a self-defence class — the punk-rock equivalent of holding your keys between your fingers, ready to fight back against any number of attackers and injustices. Their songs — the most unrestrained of which include the frenetic ""Yeah Yeah Yeah,"" the dizzying ""Lacerate"" and the vicious ""12 Years Old"" — are both imposing and empowering; they're only a threat if you're the aggressor.    If the band's previous tunes were like a knife fight, this feels more like blunt force trauma. They used to land quick jabs; now they're throwing haymakers. Yet  No Taste  is also more dynamic and measured in its violence; songs like ""Live in Reverse"" and ""Restless Body"" show that the band can operate at slower speeds while still displaying their power. While fans might miss the sneering fury of their earlier punk,  No Taste  is a different kind of rage.

2021-09-07,Veracia Ankrah,6,"ALBUM,HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,MUSIC","'Certified Lover Boy' Is Certainly a Drake Album, for Better and Worse",,"Certified Lover Boy  is anything but a love letter. Rather, it's a kiss of death to past lovers and friends who, at one point, were held in high regard but now have passed the point of no return in  Drake 's eyes.    The self-proclaimed 6 God — a title earned by not only  having the key to the city  and being the Toronto Raptors global ambassador, but also by being a music mogul in a country that is not known to champion rap music altogether let alone its hip-hop superstars — yet again addresses a few public mishaps, like the birth of his unplanned son and a rumoured falling out with Rihanna. His reflections here are slightly more fleshed out than on 2018's  Scorpion , but he doesn't present any new findings or realizations. Instead of giving hopeless romantics and fans of melodic raps the second coming of  Take Care  — filled with the pains of star-crossed love —  Certified Lover Boy  is instead an anti-climatic soundtrack for when you drop your ex's belongings off at the curb.    To open the project, Drake follows his almost-foolproof formula in allowing listeners to hear his most intimate thoughts while setting the scene for stories that transpired within the years leading up to the album (think ""Keep the Family Close"" from  Views  or ""Tuscan Leather"" from  Nothing Was the Same ). Opener ""Champagne Poetry"" flips singer-saxophonist Masego's ""Navajo"" (which riffs on ""Michelle"" by the Beatles) on a simple instrumental with haunting gospel chants, as Drake confronts ideas of guilt surrounding his parents' divorce and the untimely deaths of multiple Toronto rap artists. This thread — of losing trust after overextending his generosity and resources — appears a few times on  CLB , on songs like ""Love All"" (the latest in Drake and  JAY-Z 's roster of collaborations), ""Fair Trade"" and ""No Friends in the Industry."" In context with Drake and Kanye West's recent feud —  including a series of subliminal disses and the sharing of personal details  — lyrics like ""losing friends and gaining peace"" and ""my brothers been my brothers, man, you n****s ain't no kin to me"" are crystal clear. But whether it's either genuine rap beef or a gimmick to sell  Certified Lover Boy  and Kanye's recent  Donda , these moments don't mesh with the album's overall theme.    It wouldn't be a Drake album without several accounts of romance with all sorts of women — many who seem to have built a rapport with the ""lover boy"" throughout the years, and others with who he regrettably shares fleeting, hedonistic moments with on ""In the Bible"" and ""Pipe Down."" Champagne Papi does not shy away from his need to party, and also doesn't make excuses for the women he entertains despite being involved with someone else on ""Fucking Fans."" With lyrics like, ""Hard for me to justify the women I was into / Especially when the whole entire world wished they had you,"" it's easy to speculate Drake might be speaking about Rihanna. These sentiments display more of who we believe Drake to be — a lover of love who is sometimes swayed by the cutthroat realities of show business and being the sole provider for everyone he knows. As he stoically raps on album closer ""The Remorse,"" ""Certified lover boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that / Y'all music gets watered down when you love 'em back.""    The greatest takeaways on  Certified Lover Boy  are Drake's cultural references: his latest time-and-place track ""7 AM on Bridle Path"" (referring to the tony Toronto neighbourhood that houses  his 21,000-square-foot mansion ) features the clever bar, ""You telling them I run the country / They'll say Trudeau."" He reveals his affinity for college women and Houston on ""TSU"" and he loves women so much he considers himself a lesbian on ""Girls on Girls"" (featuring  Lil Baby ), a track that feature loads of one-liners to provide Instagram captions until his next project.  CLB  is a serviceable enough Drake album, but he has a number of prior projects that showcase his dynamic rap abilities and frenemy quarrels at a much higher calibre.

But even if the title has already been proven false by the Quebec group's upcoming slate of shows, it holds a second meaning, since these lush studio arrangements will be impossible to ever recreate live. With layered synths and rich bass tones that feel simultaneous full-bodied and feather-light,  Untourable Album  is a meticulously made album that is perfect for late-night headphone listening.    At 13 songs and 37 minutes,  Untourable Album  is around half the length of 2019's sprawling  Oncle Jazz . And while its pop songs aren't quite as catchy and immediate as past highlights like ""Tailwhip"" or ""Say Can You Hear,"" it has none of the past album's bloat. The focus here is on swooning soundscapes rather than big hooks.    The mid-album run of ""Before Dawn,"" ""Serenade of Water"" and ""5am Waltz"" has a sleepwalking strut that evokes vintage Boards of Canada, while the sublime ""Ante Meridiem"" and ""Shoulders"" recall the way Air blend acoustic guitars and futuristic electronics. ""Sugar"" recalls Men I Trust's past pop highlights but with added sonic details, like intricate bass overdubs that dance between channels.

2021-09-09,Dylan Barnabe,7,"REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY","Parting Is Such Sweet Sorrow, but Kacey Musgraves Finds Peace on 'star-crossed'",,"Kacey Musgraves  officially ushers in sad girl fall with the release of  star-crossed , her highly anticipated follow-up to the critical success of 2018's  Golden Hour . Since  receiving the Album of the Year at the Grammys , Musgraves has balanced her burgeoning celebrity with the personal pains of going through a divorce. The result is  star-crossed , billed as a ""modern tragedy"" in three parts, which sees Musgraves explore the many emotions of the past few years while charting her path to healing.    The album opens with an ethereal interlude that sets the scene of two lovers ""ripped right at the seams""⏤ and it doesn't take long to realize that this is going to be a very different kind of Kacey Musgraves album; this is a metamorphoses, an ascension, a dawning of a new day. The innocence of  Same Trailer Different Park  seems like a long forgotten era, as Musgraves leans more into the genre-bending aesthetics that propelled her to new heights in 2018. Inspired by everything from Sade to the Eagles, Musgraves drifts further from her country roots to the pop side of the moon. However the transition is seamless, given Musgraves' commitment to her vision and authenticity.    The ballad-heavy album was whittled down from dozens of songs to the final 15 following a guided mushroom trip in Nashville, TN. The trip helped Musgraves to envision how to transform her trauma, and the concept for  star-crossed  revealed itself shortly thereafter. Much like a Shakespearian tragedy, the album is divided into sections that detail the exposition, climax, downfall and resolution of Musgraves' love story.    Among the most salient messages is a line sung on ""justified,"" as she croons that ""healing doesn't happen in a straight line."" The catchy breakup song reaffirms the narrator's mixed emotions and reclaims her agency following the breakdown of a relationship. Across the album, Musgraves is able to capture the non-linear journey of love's many expectations and realities (""good wife,"" ""breadwinner,"" ""if this was a movie..."") as she tries to make sense of her past.    While Musgraves' songwriting often walks a fine line between insightful epitaphs and trite cliches (""There is a light inside of me,"" she sings), she more often than not succeeds in finding a way to convey her truth with laser-like clarity. ""camera roll"" offers up one of the more moving accounts of torturously revisiting old photos, in much the same way that ""hookup scene"" captures the stark loneliness of new beginnings. Though these moments of intense sadness permeate the majority of the album, the final few songs do point to brighter horizons (""keep looking up,"" ""what doesn't kill me,"" ""there is a light""). Hope and healing find a way.    The subdued  star-crossed  is unlikely to garner the same commercial success as  Golden Hour . It isn't carried by standout singles or big beats, but the album isn't seeking that kind of external validation. It stands alone in its vulnerability. At its core, the album reaffirms the simple truth, for better or worse, that ""it ain't easy to love someone."" Musgraves has never been afraid to take risks, explore new sounds and continue to evolve as an artist. Her latest release isn't a cry for attention, but a call-in to sit with her grief ⏤ our collective grief ⏤ and mourn the loss of something real.

2021-09-09,Allie Gregory,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Homeshake Soundtracks an Endless Winter on 'Under the Weather',,"Before the rest of us got real familiar with staying indoors last year,  Homeshake 's Peter Sagar was way ahead of the curve. Slipping into a depression in 2019, the Toronto artist spent his days perfecting the ultimate stay-home routine, binging episodes of  Star Trek  and turning his energies toward writing new music. The result of his efforts — complete with production assistance by  Jerry Paper 's Lucas Nathan — formed  Under the Weather , Sagar's follow-up to 2019's  Helium . The collection is honest in its advertising, comprising 12 tracks of warm, sad grooves designed to insulate the soul for the coming winter blues.    As necessitated by its inception,  Under the Weather  leans less into the steamy R&B hooks of his earlier works. Instead, it takes on a lonelier quality, with a slow, minimalist approach to his funky wobblers, and by cutting back on Homeshake's signature falsetto-driven sensuality. It's a sleepier record by design, and Sagar has done well by the work — despite any emotional challenges he encountered along the way. His languid, amorous crooning is layered over drowsy synths that take on a peaceful, if a bit gloomy, quality reminiscent of ConcernedApe's  Stardew Valley  OST — the ultimate cozy comfort.    In fact, he may have struck the perfect balance between atmospheric melancholy and dreamy de-stressor here; with most songs clocking in around the two-to-three-minute mark, each track still manages to stretch out and bend time to Sagar's will. A haze falls over the entire record, wrapping the listener in a lush fog, thick enough to lose track of the record's roughly 30-minute runtime. Further, album opener and closer ""Wake Up!"" and ""Reboot!"" form a near-seamless loop end-to-end, lending to the record's potential to soundtrack endless winter darkness, resembling the cold season's half-assed attempts at sunrise and sunset.    With a soft fist, Sagar beats back the dreariness on standout track ""Feel Better,"" taking time to wipe away the dozy dust for the day by pouring up a cup of brightness for the morning hours. Elsewhere, the maker sprinkles in glimmers of his distinctive mark, arpeggiating the vocal hook on ""Mindless"" and letting a funk loose on the intro of ""Vacuum,"" as well as the instrumental back section of ""Tenterhooks."" These slivers, with subtlety, remind you to open your eyes now and again, while the weary delivery of ""I Know I Know I Know"" carefully whisks you back under the covers.    Though Sagar didn't set out to make a pandemic record — how could he have known back then? — his foreboding clairvoyance on his fifth full-length is hard to deny. Take  Under the Weather  in the way it serves you best, but prepare for the album to soundtrack another season of isolation. Fellow saddies will welcome the solidarity.

2021-09-09,Daniel Sylvester,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Low Remain at the Top of Their Creative Peak on 'HEY WHAT',,"Double Negative ,  Low 's hugely celebrated 2018 LP, saw the Duluth, MN-based band moving even further away from their trademark minimal slowcore into something much more textural. On their latest release,  HEY WHAT , the duo's sound will seem almost foreign to longtime fans. But across 10 songs and 48 minutes of crunching rhythms, reverberated chants and layered noise, the husband-and-wife duo of Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker have somehow become even more melodic and melded.    Once again recorded by Charli XCX and Lizzo producer BJ Burton, Low's 13th album is an ultramodern soundscape. Tracks like the stuttering ""I Can Wait"" and the choral ""Don't Walk Away"" sound remarkably crisp, as Burton employs many of his digital layering techniques that made his work on Bon Iver's last two LPs so fascinating and mysterious.  HEY WHAT  is Low's first album recorded as as a duo, but Burton almost acts like a third member; nearly every moment is a wholly studio-crafted creation, with the only exception being Sparhawk and Parker's vocals.    Often recorded starkly clean, the pair bring a certain mortality into these airless backing tracks. But this just adds to the juxtaposition that fuels tracks like the tension-filled five-minute opener, ""White Horses,"" a song that brazenly ends with a full 90 seconds of a single note thud. The eight-minute ""Hey"" abruptly switches gears multiple times, moving from rhythmic wallop to ambient hum, all held together by Parker's affecting vocal delivery.    Although Low focus on simpler phrasing and memorable hooks across  HEY WHAT , tracks like the jagged ""All Night"" and the backmasked ""More"" use less variety in Parker's melodies, relying much more on repetition and processed chants. However, this allows much of the recording to come off as a singular piece, as tracks blend into each other and ideas and themes reoccur throughout. Even the wildly exploratory closer ""The Price You Pay (It Must Be Wearing Off)"" builds and decomposes in such a dramatic manner that it couldn't realistically be placed anywhere else on the album.    Low's latest finds Sparkhawk and Parker at a thrillingly creative and intrepid peak, building off their experimental blueprint laid out with their 2015 LP  Ones and Sixes  and fully realized on  Double Negative . Although  HEY WHAT  falls squarely in between the two, it's safe to say that no one is making music that sounds remotely similar to what Low is giving us.

2021-09-10,Luke Pearson,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK",Andrew W.K.'s 'God Is Partying' Features Very Little Partying (but Some God),,"After receiving somewhat mixed reviews for 2018's  You're Not Alone  (an enjoyable but patchy comeback album that arrived after more than a decade spent wandering the commercial fringes), party guru and goodwill magnet  Andrew W.K.  has returned relatively quickly with his superior follow-up, the ambitious  God Is Partying . It finds the 42-year-old easing into middle age with a decidedly serious interpretation of partying, and, as its title suggests, a more cosmic register to explore it in this time as well, a world where the Dionysian self-expression of partying battles against an oppressive and proscriptive Law from on high.    It can honestly be a lot sometimes, and those expecting to party hard in the old way will likely be disappointed by Andrew W.K.'s continued reliance on slow, plodding tempos. Those willing to follow this more difficult and thorny path of partying, however, will find it to be an ultimately rewarding album, full of the artist's usual earnestness and conviction.    The choice to play every instrument on  God Is Partying  himself is perhaps a reason for these mid-paced proceedings. While always an impressive feat, playing everything carries the risk of exposing one's limitations as well, and while Andrew W.K. is certainly a fine drummer, his comfort zone seems well-defined. There's plenty of tight, lockstep riffing and beat-perfect fills here (the intro to ""Everybody Sins"" is a great classic metal tour de force, for instance), but the rhythms are often more painstaking and deliberate than fun or energetic — elements Andrew W.K. was once known for. It lends a certain scope to  God Is Partying , for better or worse, and in any event seems to solidify the stylistic break between his early and middle career begun on  You're Not Alone .    He commands this mode confidently, however, dividing his time mostly between slow-burning builds and pounding, slow-motion headbanging — as well as using the opportunity to indulge his classic metal roots further than ever before. Epic intros (already firmly in the Andrew W.K. wheelhouse), organ-filled interludes, lyrics about gods and battles — they're all here. It's definitely the heaviest Andrew W.K. album ever. The relative lack of classically trained piano (such a huge part of his early sound, seemingly swapped out now for bland organ tones) is a bit of a disappointment, and when the big, complex chords finally do roll in on the almost Elton John-esque ""Remember Your Oath"" (a soaring late-album highlight that just might be about Jesus), it's frankly a bit of a relief after all the heavy going that's preceded it.     It is, in the end, a bit of a gloomy, brooding album. There is no galloping joy here, no euphoria, and frankly, very little partying — although album closer ""And Then We Blew Apart"" is a possible exception. This finale, with its ringing piano chords and big, 70s guitar lead is as classic Andrew W.K. as it gets, and there will be some who wish there were more of it. It's a great moment, but there are plenty of others on  God Is Partying  that are just as good in a different way. This is an assured return.

Travelling inwards to further her personal growth is the overarching theme of this eight-track project recorded between Montreal and Toronto. Making a significant departure from the more accessible pop stylings of her debut  Godspeed: Baptism (Prelude) , Ali has elevated her rap game with this mature offering.    Opener ""Air Ali"" sets the bar and gets the listener ready for takeoff. Assertive in her raspy delivery, Ali raps, ""Lately I've been feeling so low, but I'ma be right / Ain't no more feelings involved, I'm gonna take flight."" Throughout the album, Naya oscillates between healing self-preservation and aspirational manifestations in both mood and lyrical content. The rapper moves in and out of flow pockets, establishes melodic hook structures and navigates through a variety of production all while maintaining a sombre aesthetic. The modern horn stabs on ""Stop Playin"" are in stark contrast with the slick guitar licks of ""102 Bus It"" that reflect the traditional Ethiopian jazz of Ali's heritage.    Amidst this artistic turbulence, Naya keeps providing the conduit with her unique vocal tone and personal storytelling. The hook from the grimy ""Another One"" resonates profoundly with those who have followed Ali's career from the start: ""I ain't go pop, not another one / This is for the real, not the other ones."" With bangers like ""Str8 Up,"" it is evident that the relentless spitter who introduced herself to the Canadian hip-hop scene with 2017's  Higher Self EP  has gone full circle and returned to that original essence.    The influence of the 6ix's burgeoning rap movement is felt on ""Toronto's Gold,"" while the introspective ""King"" is perhaps the most elevated cut on this short, yet very impactful project. While listening to ""Light Switch (Outro),"" which serves as a soft landing on this creatively acrobatic plane ride, the listener will certainly get a sense that Naya Ali has cemented her creative approach.    From BET overtures, to being the first Black woman anglophone artist to perform on the nationally televised ADISQ ceremony, Ali's crossover efforts have paid dividends without denaturing the raw emotion of her music. ""I ain't go pop, not another one / This is all thrill, know there's more to come.""

2021-09-13,Wesley McLean,9,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Injury Reserve Give Stepa J. Groggs a Heartbreaking Memorial on 'By the Time I Get to Phoenix',,"On June 29, 2020, one of  Injury Reserve 's founding members, Jordan Alexander ""Stepa J."" Groggs, tragically  passed away  at 32 years old. The yin to member Nathaniel Ritchie's yang, Groggs' contributions to the trio's music were integral to their appeal and success.    Groggs' lyrics and delivery managed to be the middle ground between jovial, tongue-in-check punchlines and emotionally resonant and personally significant reflections, serving as the perfect balance to Ritchie's more traditional and technically sound approach to rapping. They had an undeniable chemistry that laid the foundation for one of the most impressive and underrated catalogues of the 2010s.    Given the immense weight of losing Groggs, it was evident that  By the Time I Get to Phoenix  would be unlike anything the group had released prior, and it is. This is by far the most experimental and least accessible Injury Reserve project thus far, abandoning any semblance of tradition or convention to deliver an incredibly gripping and emotionally poignant portrait of loss and the grief associated with it. It's an album that embraces noise and the chaos, with the group's producer Parker Corey's delivering a soundscape so hectic and anxiety-inducing that it could be used to score the next Safdie brothers film.    It's a truly captivating piece of art that explores grief and mourning in a fashion that feels as overwhelming and emotionally kaleidoscopic as the real-life experience: a blur of anger, sadness, confusion and bittersweet reminiscing, all colliding as you try and piece yourself back together. This isn't music that's trying to make you feel a certain way, it's music that just feels that way on its own. Whether it be Parker Corey's complex, glitchy and often psychedelic production, Ritchie's palpably pained lyrics or the eerie, almost foretelling verses from Groggs, you can't help but be overwhelmed by the music and the emotion behind it.     By the Time I Get to Phoenix  uses the chaotic and raucous nature of its instrumentation to present every verse, hook and bridge with the proper urgency and emotional weight they need. From Ritchie's repeated, visceral chants of ""ain't no savin' me"" drowning in a sea of distorted synthesizers on ""Superman That,"" to Groggs' slightly off-kilter delivery matching the dizzying production on ""Knees,"" everything on this project feels deliberate, even in its disorder.    This LP's biggest highlight, ""Top Picks For You,"" features a beautifully understated instrumental compared to most others on the album, and it's for a good reason. The track sees Ritchie delivering incredibly raw, cathartic verses showcasing the emotional effects that Groggs' passing has had on him.    Beginning with a muffled ""as the dust settles, I shake it off of me,"" Ritchie delves into poetic prose about coping with his loss, and the immense pain that has come with it (""I've felt loss, but a hole like this, I never could imagine""). Throughout the track, he explores moments in which he still feels Groggs' presence, only to come to the sobering realization that he's not there anymore. It's an incredibly touching song that's as intimate as it is harrowing, and makes for an impeccable and impactful centrepiece to this project.    While  By the Time I Get to Phoenix  has many moments that can be quite jarring, especially upon first listen, the direction Injury Reserve chose to take with this record is not only commendable, but incredibly impressive. It is an abstract, melancholic and affecting body of work that is not only another incredible addition to a stellar discography, but a magnificent and moving tribute to a friend gone too soon.

Moor Mother ) released  BRASS  with the supremely underappreciated rapper Billy Woods, initiating a move from subterranean experimental and jazz-inspired spoken word into more rhythmic phrasing. On her fifth album,  Black Encyclopedia of the Air , Ayewa pulls together a collection of underground hip-hop artists to help create something more digestible without sacrificing an ounce of her boundary-pushing, political, or adventurous spirit.    For example, the haunted chopped-and-screwed ""Obsidian"" features a genre-bending verse from Pink Siifu, tackles domestic violence with honest lyrics, and finds Ayewa channelling Caribbean dark magic in just 90 seconds. Across 13 tracks and a scant 32 minutes, Ayewa focuses purely on the most veracious mood for each number. The relatively short runtimes of most of the album's songs give otherwise laidback piano-looped numbers like ""Mangrove"" (featuring Antonia Gabriela and Armand Hammer's Elucid) and ""Rogue Waves"" a more immediate and authoritative veneer.    Mostly sticking to hip-hop beats and more traditional song structures — with the six-minute wandering spoken word of ""Tarot"" being the most significant exception — Ayewa decides to challenge listeners through performance and her lyrics. Tracks like ""Race Function Limited"" (featuring UK rapper Brother May) and ""Zami"" deal with prejudice and abuse, anchored by Moor Mother's powerful delivery. Written and recorded with help from Swedish musician Olof Melander, the album makes use of minimal beats culled from jazz-based performances and crackling electronics — from the muted, warped keys and washing cymbals on opener ""Temporal Control of Light Echos,"" to the Eastern violin loops on ""Shekere"" (featuring Philly rapper Lojii).    Ayewa and Melander anchor many of the tracks with tempered, stretched, echoed, doubled and warped vocals and samples, increasing the claustrophobic, nervous energy across the album and giving it its distinctive sound and flow. Just as Ayewa has won over critics by shifting her sound from the avant-garde on 2016's  Fetish Bones  to dark goth on 2019's  Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes , her latest transforms hip-hop into something indisputably alien.    But Ayewa keeps her flow so fascinatingly fluid here, as to give the album such a variety of ideas and sounds, whether she's employing an elastic rapping style on ""Vera Hall"" (featuring Compton poet Bfly) or sitting tightly on top of the beat on ""Iso Fonk."" With  Black Encyclopedia of the Air , Moor Mother uses her genre-agnostic style to tackle to world's most popular genre and make it undoubtedly her own.

2021-08-24,Paul Blinov,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",CHVRCHES Find New Vitality in Analyzing Modern Society's 'Screen Violence',,"Screen Violence ,  CHVRCHES ' fourth album, seems haunted by uncertainty: with choices made, with the world at large, and with (as its title suggests) the modern ways we share experiences. What are the consequences of filtering everything — from intimate relationships to world-on-fire doomscrolling — through the same personal device?    As a band who rose to prominence through the internet, CHVRCHES feel particularly attuned to probe those ideas. Recorded while split due to the pandemic between Glasgow and Los Angeles,  Screen Violence  also ranks among their best work; CHVRCHES seem refreshed, if tinged a few shades darker. The trio's familiar synth-pop elements are all present: Lauren Mayberry's soaring delivery of incisive lyrics over emotive waves of programming, instrumentals, and beats from Iain Cook and Martin Doherty. But they've found new vitality in exploring a loose theme of, well, violence experienced on, by and through screens — examining big present-day questions through their more personal, disquieting impacts.    ""Asking for a Friend"" is a bent-not-broken anthem of affirming digital hooks and bittersweet sentiments, while ""He Said She Said"" finds Mayberry taking stock of toxic things she's been told by men. World-weariness gathers like a storm over ""California"", where Mayberry sings, ""God bless this mess that we made for ourselves / pull me into the screen at the end.""      Cook and Doherty's sonics feel lively and responsive to the mood, pushing their palette in new directions without sacrificing cinematic scale: ""Violent Delights"" rides a skittering beat to underline how ""these violent delights / keep creeping into my nights."" Heavy piano chords rain down over the excellent goth-pop of ""How Not to Drown"", featuring a kismet guest spot from the Cure's Robert Smith, while ""Final Girl"" borrows horror movie iconography as Mayberry surveys her own self-doubts with the path she's on: ""Don't want to find your daughter in a body bag / So I need to get out now while most of me is still intact.""    Closer ""Better If You Don't"" cuts most of the band's usual electronics away, winnowing its focus to a solitary guitar line and Mayberry's voice, as it turns personal history into an endless screen-scroll all its own: ""I've been gone and notice every change.""    It's to CHVRCHES' credit that  Screen Violence  doesn't suggest any shallow, put-down-your-phone answers to the questions it raises. Instead, the album makes an unflinching appraisal of present-day anxieties to summon the vitality needed to keep going, in spite of what keeps coming through the screen.

2021-08-25,Tom Beedham,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Breeze Unites Toronto's Shattered Music Scene on 'Only Up',,"Only Up  starts with a statement of disbelief and ends with a sense of direction.    Rallying a score of local friends and collaborators, Josh Korody ( Beliefs ,  Nailbiter ) has dissolved the jangly, guitar-driven pop of previous  Breeze  releases and synthesized a hazy Madchesterian party, but laser-sharp concentration (the album was written, recorded, and mixed all in eight days) connects its dreamy surface quality to deeper thematic concerns.    On  Only Up , dreams are vital, recreational, stimulating — but they're also under attack.    On ""Don't Cry,"" they're haunted; on the terminal title track they're ""vanishing,"" subsuming to fears. ""Get outta my dreams, that's my free time,""  Cadence Weapon  raps around screaming synths, psychedelic guitars and blown-out hand percussion on ""Come Around,"" setting boundaries on emotional labour and piggybacking on the grievances Korody airs over a friend that responded to a call-in by shrugging off accountability and acting like nothing happened. And, announcing its arrival on joyful horns and shakers, ""Ecstasy on Keele Street"" invokes the image of the bed as a place of safety and security, but not without casting suspicion on whether the version it will provide will be of any real or lasting quality.     The title of that last track could just be a reference to dropping E on a stretch of road in Toronto's Junction neighbourhood (likely at the pre-2019 parties at textile factory-by-day/party spot-by-night 500 Keele), but it also suggests the street itself — a rough industrial stretch far enough from downtown developers and NIMBYism that its distance from the forced nomadic grind the city traps artists in — has rhapsodic potential.    The world Korody alludes to throughout the album is one of encroaching developers, rapid gentrification, venue closures and unaccountable peers. You get to wondering if the title of the album might even be a reference to how much sleep he's getting.    ""This is a hard-boiled wonderland,"" Korody declares on stream-of-consciousness exercise ""Hard Boiled Wonderland,"" borrowing a title from Haruki Murakami, mixing metaphors, and locating the action of the album in a place that's partially a druggy dreamland, partially a tough and unsentimental crime landscape.    It's similar territory Korody explored with Beliefs on their 2017 project-redefining  Habitat , but here, the displacement anxiety hits the dance floor, exploding in emotional colour. Korody trades out cold post-punk distance to affect a cool Madchester dropout, rose-tinted glasses and acid guitars recasting the barren landscape in psychedelic possibility.  Tess Parks  and a chorus of Korody's peers ( Jesse Crowe ,  Robyn Phillip ,  Michael le Riche ,  Julia Wittmann ) take the album out on a hazy but at least cautiously optimistic note: ""Where to go? Only up.""    The subtext to that line is that all the damage the community has weathered in the process couldn't really get any worse (and there's also some double entendre happening; Parks opens the track on the lines ""We're getting pushed out / In downtown""), but what  Only Up  suggests at its core is an opportunity to unite Toronto's hitherto fragmented music scene; rave music, hip-hop and bands can coexist, rebuild the scene anew and have a hell of a good time doing it. The party doesn't have to be where everyone goes after the show; it's there on the periphery with a schedule imagining live bands, adventurous DJs and hungry MCs gobbling up the same stimulus, a generative engine facilitating deeply felt connections and memories, a journey with no set destination — only up.

2021-08-25,Ian Gormely,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Big Red Machine Continue Prioritizing Vibes over Riffs on 'How Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last?',,"Indie rock has had a falling out with the guitar riff. Over the last 15 years, what was once the organizing force behind any kind of guitar-based music has taken a back seat to mood and vibe. Justin Vernon and  Aaron Dessner  didn't pioneer this shift, but, as members of two of the era's biggest and most culturally significant indie bands —  Bon Iver  and  the National , respectively — they made little effort to make amends.     How Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last? , Vernon and Dessner's second collaboration as  Big Red Machine , offers the most pop-friendly music of their respective aesthetics. It's an austere collection of songs that successfully incorporates Vernon's penchant for electronics, Dessner's guitar and piano textures, and big hooks sung by some big (and not-so-big) friends.    Big Red Machine has its roots in  Dark Was the Night , the extremely prescient 2009 compilation Aaron and his brother Bryce curated for the Red Hot Organization. It took them a decade to produce a full album, 2018's  Big Red Machine , and this follow-up arrives after Dessner's work on  Taylor Swift 's  folklore  and  evermore  albums, to which Vernon also contributed. (In a press release, Dessner credited Swift's encouragement to the album's, um, swift completion.)    Like its predecessor,  How Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last?  comes with a list of heavy-hitting collaborators, most notably Swift herself, who duets with Vernon on ""Birch"" and takes the lead on ""Renegade."" Yet neither she nor anyone else contributing to the project — including  Fleet Foxes '  Robin Pecknold ,  Sharon Van Etten ,  Anaïs Mitchell  and Ariel Engle of  Broken Social Scene / La Force  — ever threaten to overwhelm it. Each puts their own spin on their respective tracks, but it's hard to hear them as anything but part of Vernon and Dessner's artistic vision. With the exception of ""The Ghost of Cincinnati,"" which is just Dessner and his guitar, it's difficult to separate one artist's contributions from another's — the central pair co-wrote the majority of the record's 15 tracks.    Dessner and Vernon could have recorded a record's worth of ambient soundscapes and probably enjoyed a decent bump in their streaming numbers from their affiliation with Swift, but, to their credit, they bring their A-game to every track. ""Reese"" and the Pecknold-sung ""Phoenix"" are immediate favourites, while ""Hutch,"" on which Vernon is backed by Van Etten,  Lisa Hannigan  and  My Brightest Diamond 's Shara Nova, is a spiritual sequel to the soulful ""Hymnostic"" from Big Red Machine's debut. Mood and vibe are foundations, but they've taken care to make sure there are hooks and melodies to carry them.    While  Big Red Machine  lacked immediate standouts, it was intriguing for its ponderous excursions. Depending on your perspective, the sense of purpose and professionalism that marks  How Long Do You Think This is Gonna Last?  is as much a knock as it is an asset. The production, tempos and sense that everything is in its right place can, on lesser tracks (it's a couple songs too long) make the record feel staid, purpose-built for storied soft-seat theatres instead of dank clubs or booming arenas.     Nevertheless, this second Big Red Machine is a masterclass on the aesthetic that Vernon and Dessner have been honing across their careers.

2021-08-26,Paul Dika,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Turnstile's 'GLOW ON' Makes Hardcore Genre-Fluid,,"Prior to the start of the pandemic,  Turnstile  were a band on the rise, playing to larger rooms as they toured in support of their 2018 album  Time & Space . However, once lockdowns were put in place, the five-piece known for their highly energetic, chaotic and cathartic live shows remained fairly quiet until this past summer, with the release of a single, and then a surprise EP,  TURNSTILE LOVE CONNECTION . The four-song release was received with high praise, even catching the attention of pop-punk legends  Tom DeLonge  and  Hayley Williams . Shortly thereafter came the announcement of the hardcore veterans' new LP,  GLOW ON . Turnstile's latest effort spans 15 tracks, and sees the band continue to embrace genre fluidity, while delivering the heavy riffs and breakdowns longtime fans have come to expect.    The EP proved to be an accurate indication of what to expect on the full length, as the four songs — of which all appear on  GLOW ON  — all vary in their sound. While  Time & Space  featured brief interludes that hinted at the band's influences outside of the hardcore sphere, the band has fully embraced them and incorporated them throughout  GLOW ON . Track-to-track, and even within each song, there is a level of unpredictability.    The quintet insert left turns that will catch listeners off guard, but make each song that much more engaging. ""DON'T PLAY"" opens with a blistering double-time punk intro before settling into a heavy rhythmic groove, with a riff that sounds like it could have been plucked from their 2015 debut album,  Nonstop Feeling . ""HUMANOID / SHAKE IT UP"" clocks in at just over a minute, and features one of the most jarring (yet satisfying) transitions on the entire album. The juxtaposition between the first and second half of the song really speaks to the creative licence Turnstile have afforded themselves, spending years as a band committed to growing, evolving and exploring new approaches to songwriting.    ""UNDERWATER BOI"" and ""NEW HEART DESIGN"" showcase the band expanding even further outside the hardcore genre, as both songs feature shiny guitars, bouncing bass lines and clean vocals, showcasing vocalist Brandon Yates' range moreso than on previous releases. The Blood Orange-featuring ""ALIEN LOVE CALL"" is a slow and quiet, tremolo-filled track that sees the band flex their shoegaze muscles, and proves that anything and everything is on the table. Piano intros, hand claps, celestial synths, falsetto vocals all come into play on the album, and work well. Each band member brings their musicianship and years of experience to the table, tailoring their skillset to each song individually, regardless of the style. The eclecticism gives the album a flow and distinction that otherwise wouldn't exist on most hardcore albums.    There is still plenty of what people have come to expect from Turnstile on the album. There are songs that feature heavy riffs, pulsating drums, juicy bass tones and searing guitar leads. ""HOLIDAY"", ""BLACKOUT"" and ""T.L.C."" are all knee-benders with big breakdowns, and demonstrate why the band have become a mainstay among hardcore fans. Lyrically, Yates reflects on the uncertainty of the past year-and-a-half, and how the pandemic has impacted the band's trajectory. On ""BLACKOUT"", Yates exclaims, ""Blackout in the middle of the light"" and ""Let the spotlight shine on me again,"" sentiments that capture a desire to pick up where their momentous rise left off before they were stopped in their tracks so suddenly. ""NO SURPRISE"", which features bass player Franz Lyons on lead vocals, alludes to the transcendental nature of the band: ""You really got to see it live to get it"". A quiet social media presence and a lack of interest in performing livestream events only add to Turnstile's reputation as a band that need to be seen in-person to be truly experienced. Relying on their music to engage with their fans is something Turnstile have always been able to do, and the theme of reconnection can be found throughout the record.    For all of  GLOW ON 's strengths, its genre-hopping nature and unwieldly length lead to a couple of misses. ""ENDLESS"" feels like it would be more at home on the back half of a Rise Against album and ""DANCE-OFF"" never really finds its footing after the opening riff. On an album filled with memorable choruses and compelling twists, these songs prove to be the exception.      GLOW ON  is an album that is intriguing, unpredictable, heavy, groovy, ambient and loud all at the same time, and serves as Turnstile's crucial next step forward. There is a lot to chew on here, and that's what makes  GLOW ON  an album that will stay fresh after many replays.

2021-08-30,Rachel Kelly,6,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Halsey's 'If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power' Lacks the Latter",,"Alt-popster  Halsey  has sanded some shine off their sound to create a gritty pop-punk album that puffs out its chest but does little else. Their fourth album,  If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power , promises a bold, fantastical concept album, but while it sounds the part, lyrically and conceptually it rings a bit hollow.    Like on their first two albums — 2015's  Badlands  and 2017's  hopeless fountain kingdom —  Halsey seems to lose commitment to their concept midway through, a disappointment after the accomplishment of last year's  Manic . The wonky pastiche of Catholic imagery, folklore tropes and grunge themes strings together phrases and metaphors that mean next to nothing. Halsey is perpetually a fussy rebel without a cause; their lyrics evoke themes of revolution, power, and violence, but to what end is unclear. While their songs can feel like galvanizing anthems, they lack a driving force to land the punches they talk about throwing.    The album's first half sets an intriguing baroque landscape full of the holy and the sinful, like giving the pop-punk revival treatment to FKA twigs's  Magdalene . Despite their pop beginnings, Halsey has plenty of experience as a rock vocalist that makes the shift in their sound feel natural. Producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails do a good job pushing Halsey's sound into idiosyncratic, aggressive territory and bringing out the grit in their vocals. The first half of the album flows well, hitting hard with the screaming ""Easier Than Lying,"" slinking through the delicious ""Lilith"" and embracing full garage-band nostalgia with ""You asked for this."" Throughout this, Halsey demonstrates shades of riot grrrl and early-aughts emo, with plenty of alt-pop panache to keep fans happy.    These tracks shouldn't necessarily work together, yet somehow they do, and it's a treat to listen through in order. However, the middle of the album culminates in ""Darling,"" a tinkling, precious country love song that feels shoe-horned into an otherwise promising tracklist. At this point, the album seems to forget the world it set out to explore. The religious imagery becomes disjointed, the lyrics become sloppy, and the flow of the first half is lost.    Many of the album's remaining songs still sound great individually even if they fail to build on the groundwork of the first half. Lead single ""I am not a woman, I'm a god"" is a synth-heavy, throbbing arrangement that successfully marries Halsey's pop, hip-hop and punk influences into an angry yet danceable tune. ""Whispers"" is a raw, dark track that focuses on promiscuity as self-sabotage; this is a theme Halsey explores often, and every new attempt demonstrates both impressive growth and aching authenticity. One of the album's shining moments is ""The Lighthouse,"" a mix of country noir storytelling and a sea shanty backed by dark, stormy guitar. The bizarre and playful genre-bend is Halsey at their best: cinematic, outside the lines, a little macabre, and exceptionally creative.    The album succeeds with songs that are a fun listen and a smart revisit to pop-punk nostalgia. However, all the clever production and accomplished vocals cannot disguise that the album simply cannot find its point. Thematically, the songwriting is all over the place and at times vapid and nearly nonsensical. The stronger elements at play get thrown off by tracks that were probably better left for a different project entirely. The album's lack of cohesion doesn't necessarily degrade the listening experience, but it prevents the songs from feeling like a complete project. Despite being a generally enjoyable listen,  If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power  fails to pack any real emotional punch.

2021-08-30,Riley Wallace,7,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Kanye West's Bloated 'Donda' Has Glimpses of Classic Yeezy,,"Forty days and nights — seriously — after first announcing his 10th studio album via  a Beats by Dre commercial starring track and field sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson ,  Kanye West  officially released his tenth studio album,  Donda , though apparently  not with his explicit approval . Following the release of his Grammy-winning gospel affair, 2020's  Jesus Is King , the album offers an objectively more accessible body of work, though it isn't without its flaws.    During a January 2020 Sunday Service, Ye took particular offence to Drake's suggestion that he may never again make secular music. In a classic Ye rant, he noted to the crowd, ""Don't call me secular, 'cause secular is trying to say that I'll do anything for anyone other than Christ. That's where they got it messed up."" He stays steadfast in this sentiment, but  Donda  is far less heavy-handed than  Jesus Is King ; instead, it's noticeably more sombre, though it manages to balance his faith and ongoing spiritual journey with glints of classic Kanye.    In proper (classic) Kanye form, and unlike his last two releases, this album is long. While it's the product of apparent locked-in focus, it doesn't hold on to consistent genius across the expansive, nearly two-hour setlist, filled with a dizzying line-up of guests.    Some of the guests help provide the album with its shiniest gems, including  JAY-Z  on the  exhilarating  Watch the Throne  reunion ""Jail""  (thankfully not replaced by  DaBaby , as was implied by  the latter's appearance at the third and final listening party mere days ago , whose version now appears as ""Jail, Pt. 2"" at the project's tail end);  the LOX , who appear on the second part of the album's centrepiece, ""Jesus Lord,"" with the once-elusive MC  Jay Electronica ;  Kid Cudi  on ""Moon""; and  Conway the Machine , who appears with his brother  Westside Gunn  on ""Keep My Spirit Alive."" Features like Vory over the thundering bass of ""God Breathed,""  Playboi Carti  and Fivio Foreign eating up ""Off the Grid,"" and  the Weeknd  and  Lil Baby  skating over ""Hurricane"" help alley-oop Ye some of the best material he's made in years.    However, with so many chefs in the kitchen, sometimes things get muddled — especially with Ye perpetually tinkering with elements that perhaps aren't broken, causing things to fall apart in other places. While there is a message of hope, rebirth and salvation abound, songs like ""Remote Control"" with  Young Thug  (and the bizarre Globglogabgalab cameo) feel oddly off-brand when Ye isn't on the mic, as does the addition of Rooga on ""Ok Ok, Pt. 2."" Ultimately, the sheer volume of guests and scattered sequencing keep this project from being the best that it could be.    Perhaps the biggest flaw was the transparency in its creation process; letting fans hear three very different listening experiences probably wasn't the best idea. ""Jail"" was once the album closer but now serves as the second track, which frankly throws the vibe off — mainly because Ye played an alternate and more logical song sequence weeks ago.    There are swipes at cancel culture by DaBaby (among other mixed messaging), and overproduced songs, like the final mixes of ""Hurricane"" and ""New Again"" with  Chris Brown  that don't help the cause when the original mixes sounded cleaner. Also, it's difficult to know whether the contributions by JAY-Z, Kid Cudi, the LOX and Conway were left out of the third listening session strategically or whether Ye tacked them back on at the last moment because of the  tsunami of fan feedback . Either way, at 27 songs, it's bloated.    It's hard not to feel the energy that Kanye exudes on  Donda . Though its creation process was an overarching performative event in itself, Ye still managed to (for the most part) control his narrative, and deliver his best body of work in recent memory. It's just hard not to think that some trimming and sequencing tweaks could have made this LP that much greater and his message that much more poignant.

2021-08-27,Eric Hill,8,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Jason Sharp Puts His Heart — Literally — into 'The Turning Centre of a Still World',,"Over his first couple of releases for Constellation Records, the sound of  Jason Sharp  was largely one of transmutation. Via sample and synthesis, expansion and recontextualization, the Montreal musician reshaped the sounds of his saxophone and the bodily elements engaged in play into electroacoustic landscapes that, at times, resembled the pulsing tones of John Carpenter-esque soundtracks describing tension and impending something-or-other. For  The Turning Centre of a Still World , Sharp hasn't reinvented his colour wheel, but he has again refined its hues and found a more direct source of light to shine across it.    In part, this shift — defined by the moments where his saxophone peeks through the tonal shadows and shows itself free from enhancements — may derive from being the first truly solo effort Sharp has delivered. For his 2016 debut,  A Boat Upon Its Blood , Sharp was joined by Joshua Zubot on violin and Joe Grass on pedal steel filling out the finely detailed work, while 2018's  Stand Above the Streams  resulted from a collaboration with sound artist Adam Basanta, who contributed controlled feedback and amplification systems in the recordings. Between his releases, Sharp also provided his skills to a variety of other projects including labelmate Sam Shalabi's Land of Kush, Leonard Cohen's posthumous release  Thanks for the Dance  and the score for action film  Jusqu'au Déclin  ( The Decline ).    The through line — or, perhaps more accurately, through pulse — of Sharp's work is provided by a customized heart monitor used to time the modular synthesizers and sample triggers informed by his breath and performance on the saxophone. Its presence is first notable in the constantly varying beat that twists between the cascade of notes that sparkle across ""Unwinding Surrender."" His extended technique recalls the sound of fellow baritone experimenter Colin Stetson, but with a sleeker approach.    ""Velocity of Being"" takes on a very Vangelis vibe, conjuring  Blade Runner 's 1980s imagining of the future, with a cluster of soaring tones and clamoring arpeggios occasionally pierced by the lens flare of a reedy skronk. The album's declarative centre is ""Upwelling Hope,"" with an extended overture that is eventually infused with many roiling and breathy saxophone loops layered atop each other, suggesting life emerging from some protoplasmic mass. It is a thing of beauty and wonder.    Radwan Ghazi Moumneh of Jerusalem in My Heart handles production duties, and at every turn uncovers the human vibration that agitates and casts Sharp's occasionally inorganic tendencies. But it is Sharp himself who shares his literal heart here, at the aptly named ""turning centre"" of his world of sound.

2021-08-31,Riley Wallace,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Westside Gunn's Curation Remains Impeccable on 'Hitler Wears Hermes 8: Sincerely Adolf',,"One thing stays clear no matter what  Westside Gunn  touches: his curation skills are impeccable. Griselda's multi-year run looks anything but winded with  Sincerely Adolf , the eighth (and ambiguously final) installment of the series that started it all for the collective,  Hitler Wears Hermes . The project is concise, with little wasted space among the 13 tracks.    What becomes immediately apparent is the extra time that Gunn spent cooking up this platter. Notoriously known to record projects in a matter of days, the additional love has the Buffalo MC sounding spryer and sharper than ever. Whether rocking alongside Stove God Cooks — who sparkles on all four of his features — or teaming up with one of the more revered rappers of the past two decades,  Lil Wayne  — who bodies the screwface-inducing ""Bash Money"" — he's never overpowered.    That's one of the most admirable things about West's executive production; guests are brought to his level, and you can hear the mutual respect. Everything feels organic rather than an attempt to shove square pegs into circle slots. This is accentuated by the production throughout, crafted by Conductor Williams, Denny LaFlare (who contributed some of the project's most brilliant gems) and longtime collaborator Camoflauge Monk. The beats all feel cohesive, as if the three producers were one.     An Achilles heel of Griselda affairs can sometimes be when things get a little too off-kilter or when elements overstay their welcome. ""Westheimer,"" featuring Stove God Cooks, slow-flow Griselda rhymer  Boldy James  (fresh off of his  Bo Jackson  LP with the Alchemist) and Sauce Walka, is minimalist to the point of sonic monotony, especially with Boldy's flow. Then there is Gunn's long-winded speech about how much money he has on ""Claires Back,"" which makes an otherwise hype song — with an incredible second half thanks to  Conway the Machine  and  Benny the Butcher  — longer than it needs to be.    But it's hard to stay mad at this project's momentary lulls, as it's yet another example of Gunn giving fans everything they want and expect. From classic Hall & Nash back-to-back bars with Conway (""Spoonz""), a platform for acts he champions like Rome Streetz (who appears on ""Draymond"" and ""Peri Peri""), and one or two features with cultural icons (in this case,  Jadakiss  and Lil Wayne), the formula stays remarkably similar but — as it always does with Gunn at the helm — feels exceptionally fresh.     According to Gunn,  this is one side of a two-part set . It remains to be seen if that second act will have a similar vibe sonically, especially considering Griselda acts Armani Caesar and YN Billy are noticeably absent this time around — as is a Keisha Plum poem, which is generally a WSG staple. For that matter, it's difficult to know if this is indeed the final installment, as that was a descriptor given to the seventh entry in the series.    It feels like as long as West is engaged and feeling creative, we're in for more music, and if he keeps giving us consistency on this level, it's hard to be mad at that.

2021-09-02,Stephan Boissonneault,8,"ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK",Motorists Are Jangle Pop Philosophers on 'Surrounded',,"The first few vocal lines in  Surrounded , the debut album from Toronto jangle pop wonders  Motorists , are ""I left the city / Too many cars / Too many creeps / Too many bars.""    The opening title track is a simple indie rock tune, but absurdist in nature, with the theme of leaving populated areas that run on boxed technologies and exhaustion. No matter where frontman Craig Fahner goes, he will always be ""surrounded"" — by bricks, walls, grass, glass, asphalt, water. It's becoming increasingly difficult to truly escape and be alone with one's thoughts.    ""Surrounded"" sets off the existential paranoia mood of the album, which continues with the Johnny Marr-esque, treble-heavy electric guitar that begins ""Vainglorious,"" an angsty number examining alienation through a political lens. The powers that be say they want what's best for the modern man, but actively work against them with policies or broken promises. Fahner is once again left with his own thoughts, and he wonders how someone can be so paradoxical, standing for nothing and everything at the same time.    The cadence of the layered vocals and guitars on  Surrounded  is similar to that of Motorists' predecessors, Sloan, especially their earlier work on  Smeared  and  Twice Removed . But instead of songs about past lovers and immaturity, Motorists are using philosophical ideas as fuel for their jangly indie rock.    ""Through to You"" is about those first awkward conversations we all had after isolation and features some of the band's brightest melodies and calmingly sweet vocals. There's also a nice vocal nod to another one of the band's jangle rock forebears, R.E.M.    ""Natural Targets"" amps up the sonic intensity, exploring a sense trepidation towards emerging technology, especially with artificial intelligence changing what it means to be human. The song also contains one of the only guitar solos on the album and, though it's brief, it rips. ""Walled Garden"" speaks to the metaphorical and sometimes tangible walls tech companies raise up to limit our choices in exchange for fleeting moments of satisfaction.    Though the album deals with isolation during a pandemic,  Surrounded  would have been written regardless. Motorists think about the perils and joys of modern living and offer their point of view of this strange experience we call reality.

2021-08-05,Adam Feibel,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Foxing Voyage to a Galaxy of Their Own on 'Draw Down the Moon',,"By now,  Foxing  can only be expected to keep pushing their limits and defying expectations. When the St. Louis group emerged in 2013 with their endearing debut  The Albatross , they were already among the most forward-thinking purveyors of the emo revival (even if the full weight of their significance is only being retroactively acknowledged years later). With their sophomore album  Dealer  in 2015, they gave early fans their first challenge with a muted and darkly majestic sound that still demands the right atmosphere and attention to truly be appreciated. They reached their going-for-it moment with  Nearer My God  in 2018, as they burst forth with an array of bold ideas in one of the most unashamedly audacious indie-rock records of that decade.     In anticipation of Foxing's fourth album  Draw Down the Moon , it wasn't even worth guessing what they'd do — you just had to wait and see. (The band teased the album with a cryptic series of online games called ""rituals,"" the first sign to expect the unexpected.) As it turns out,  Nearer My God  wasn't necessarily Foxing's magnum opus, but their modus operandi:  Draw Down the Moon  is a very different record, but it retains that same level of adventurousness.     Foxing are known for going big, and there's nothing bigger than the vast eternity of existence. Throughout  Draw Down the Moon , Foxing ruminates on the ""cosmic significance"" of being one person in a boundless universe. The record draws from religion and spirituality but also  Dungeons & Dragons  and magical folklore — taking its title from Margot Adler's book about contemporary Paganism — all while the band swirls and pulses through 40 minutes of music that incorporates remnants of the band's emo origins into a kaleidoscope of dance-floor pop, disco prog, orchestral post-rock and even a touch of alt-metal.    For Foxing, that sense of ""cosmic significance"" is in the interpersonal connections and shared experiences that make a single person part of something extraordinarily vast. These are songs about success and failure, time and aging, romance and sexuality, trust and vulnerability, love and death — all of them put forward with such passion and dedication that it certainly feels significant.     ""If you should fall, I'll follow behind / We'll go down there together,"" Murphy sings in ""Go Down Together,"" a song that, like many of the tracks on  Draw Down the Moon , channels the alt-pop sounds of MGMT, Passion Pit, M83 and Cold War Kids. For a band of Foxing's background to make this kind of move is a risky proposition, and to do so while keeping intact the artful, atmospheric qualities that have defined them to date isn't easy. Yet on both fronts, songs like ""Go Down Together,"" ""Draw Down the Moon"" and ""If I Believed in Love"" succeed greatly.      Draw Down the Moon  was produced by the band's guitarist Eric Hudson over the course of a year at their St. Louis studio, before they headed to Georgia to finish the project with members of Manchester Orchestra and then finally sent it off for mixing by John Congleton (St. Vincent, Cloud Nothings). Those combined efforts have resulted in a sonically rich record that brings every smattering of ideas into tight focus. ""Beacons,"" already a fan favourite from their pre-pandemic live shows, is exhilarating in its pulsating pace, soaring melodies and spacey sounds. ""Cold Blooded"" feels like a  The Albatross -era tune with the rafter-reaching choruses of Arcade Fire's  Funeral . ""Where the Lightning Strikes Twice,"" easily the album's most polarizing cut, borrows the disco groove of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass,"" the futuristic rock of Muse and a proudly indulgent guitar solo that would elicit a knowing smirk from Queen's Brian May.     Throughout, Murphy offers a string of reminders that even if it feels like it, we're never really alone. ""Without you, I feel so homesick everywhere I go,"" he sings in the fuzzy groove of ""Bialystok."" ""Honey, at least you found the floor / It can't get much worse than this,"" he croons in ""At Least We Found the Floor,"" a song that's intimate and oddly comforting, especially if you're a fan of the National. These are the types of songs that speak to the power of human relationships — that those connections remain unshakably strong even in times of hardship.    ""Speak with the Dead,"" featuring Yoni Wolf of WHY?, is the album's closing pièce de résistance: Setting the tone with a synth bed of celestial sounds inspired by Hans Zimmer's score to  Interstellar , it builds into a glorious crescendo of thundering percussion and rousing horns reminiscent of Sigur Rós, before eventually opening up into a quasi jam session modelled after Steely Dan. It all works together beautifully, and the sense of longing for loved ones who have passed is devastatingly palpable. The album's final lines — ""Wherever I go, there you are"" — leave you to sit quietly with the notion that what binds us together lasts forever.    Making their case for a spot among widely revered art-rock outfits like Arcade Fire, Radiohead and Portugal. The Man, Foxing continue to be constantly compelling due to their insistent multidimensionality and commitment to going all-in with every effort. The band had already pushed well beyond their initial territory with  Nearer My God .  Draw Down the Moon  transports them out of that world entirely and into a galaxy of their own.

2021-08-05,Daniel Sylvester,9,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Lingua Ignota's 'Sinner Get Ready' Is More Incantation Than Collection of Songs,,"There's absolutely nothing reductive in comparing the music of Kristin Hayter (a.k.a. Lingua Ignota) to other artists. In fact, the artist completed an esteemed academic career by channeling her own experiences through figures from Johann Sebastian Bach to Andrey Markov. That's why it makes sense to use musicians like Diamanda Galás, Jarboe and Lydia Lunch to explain how Lingua Ignota delivers such vulnerable art in such brutal ways.    Lingua Ignota is willing to share the aforementioned women's methods of expressing real-life trauma though repossessing representative imagery that is often connected to victimhood, as on her breakthrough 2019 album,  Caligula . Her fourth LP,  Sinner Get Ready , doesn't just explore her own Christian upbringing, but also the mass privilege it is capable of spreading amongst its followers, specifically within her current community in rural Pennsylvania. But, as shown by tracks like the lyrically dramaturgical ""I Who Bend the Tall Grasses"" and the intimate, prayer-sampling ""The Sacred Linament of Judgment,"" Lingua Ignota's classically trained craft actually isn't as effective when the listener attempts to dissect her tactile devices, but seems more emotional affecting when all pretenses are abandoned and forgotten.    Throughout nine compositions, Lingua Ignota frames her treated piano with altar bells, field recordings, chants, orchestral strings and a controlled operatic vocal style to channel a wild range of moods. But there's nothing mercurial about her fourth LP, as the gloomy and delicate ""Pennsylvania Furnace"" (which describes a man being dragged to Hell by his dogs) and the exceptionally dark and weeping ""Perpetual Flame of Centralia"" make Lingua Ignota seem more like a witness to the described exploitation than a fatality.    On tracks like the nine-minute opener ""The Order of Spiritual Virgins"" and the organ dirge ""Many Hands,"" Lingua Ignota works off of spatial patience, as Hayter expertly builds tension throughout their sonic ebbs and flows. This leads to an incredibly exploratory hour of music, despite the gloomy mood she creates throughout, best demonstrated by the banjo-assisted ""Repent Now Confess Now"" and the almost-melodic closer ""The Solitary Brethren of Ephrata.""    As Hayter entered her career in music as a trained music and art scholar, she ensures the lyrics that haunt her latest release are as nightmare-inducing as her music. Her description of religious iconography, filled with the blood of Jesus and torture at the hands of those who judge, are as horrifying as the most depraved doom metal lyrics.  Sinner Get Ready  is nothing short of a strikingly effective album, sounding more like an incantation than a mere collection of songs.

2021-08-09,Luke Fox,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Nas Is No Pretender to the Throne on 'King's Disease II',,"Accomplished and respected enough to kick up his feet and puff cigars till the Hall of Fame calls,  Nasir Jones  has instead slammed the creative gas pedal. Maybe it's because the pandemic has shackled touring artists to their home studios. Maybe it's because the emcee's emcee has stumbled onto a platinum producer (Hit-Boy) with whom he clicks easy as Duplo. Or maybe, like so many of us closer to 50 than 40, he just feels comfortable in his own skin, with his own thoughts.    Regardless the reason, for the first time since his fame-chasing run in the late-'90s when he crossed over to the silver screen ( Belly ) and recorded like a fiend, Nas has dropped two albums in under 12 months. But unlike  I Am…  and  Nastradamus  (both jammed into 1999), there is a level of consistency and focus to 2020's  Grammy-winning   King's Disease  and the spankin'-fresh  King's Disease II  that speaks of a grown man at peace with making grown-man rap records.     The buzzy, chipped-toothed kid who ""went to hell for snuffing Jesus"" and monkey-flipped rappers out the ring in '94 is no longer taking the world by storm. Now he's sipping bottomless Bellinis and surveying the landscape from a penthouse view, taking stock of his legacy and his caloric intake. Blunt ashes have been replaced by pinot residue. Yet even on album number 14, the pen game remains tack sharp. So, while  KD2 's cringiest dad raps — ""miles on my Peloton, I've been working on my core"" and ""chef know how to cook with no salt and low fat"" — feel a million miles from  Illmatic , Nas is still reporting live from his perch. After three decades of relevant recordings, the kid shaped by those Queensbridge projects can simply afford a better one.     Wearing Hit-Boy's clean, soulful bounce like a cozy robe, Nas has reached a sense of contentment and reflection. This leads to an entire rap joint about enjoying ""Brunch on Sundays,"" sure, but it also gives Nas the clarity to sift through his 2Pac beef and quiet reconciliation with precision (the excellent ""Death Row East"") and freedom to share the mic with a variety of heavy-hitting personalities, without fear they'll rob his shine. ""My whole career I steered away from features / But I figured it's perfect timing to embrace new leaders,"" Nas reasons. The listeners win.    Don Tolliver and  Lil Baby  add flourishes to ""The Pressure"" and ""40 Side,"" respectively.  A Boogie wit da Hoodie  and  YG  help form an unusual but effective trio on ""YKTV."" Yet the soaring peaks of the LP reunite Nas with heroes from the golden era. ""EPMD 2,"" the sequel to Nas's contribution to the  Judas and the Black Messiah  soundtrack , invites  the titular duo  plus  Eminem  along for the ride. Although Em produced for Nas way back in '02 (""The Cross""), the two titans have never shared the same mic. Eminem, who still treats hip-hop like a sport, bats cleanup on ""EPMD 2,"" and it speaks to Nas's confidence that he lets Eminem steal the show.     Ditto Ms.  Lauryn Hill  on the superb ""Nobody,"" one of the LP's most compelling conceptual pieces. On the track, a wistful Nas dreams of escaping fame and expectation. He empathizes with Dave Chappelle's bolt to Africa, understanding the pull of living ""someplace to be nobody."" Then, Nas's frequent tourmate and ""If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)"" collaborator blesses the track with a rare and searing rap verse: ""I'm savin' souls, and y'all complainin' 'bout my lateness / Now it's illegal for someone to walk in greatness,"" Ms. Hill blazes.     The momentum of  King's Disease II 's eventual first half results in some lag to the finish line, but whether it's inspired singles (""Rare""), fresh collaborations, new ideas or bejeweled one-liners (""How you expect to get love if you don't show none?""), King Nas serves up another reminder that he's no pretender to the throne. The wild ambition has just evolved into calculated wisdom. Or, as our host puts it: ""Everything I know now, wish I knew back then.""

2021-08-11,Kerry Doole,8,"REVIEWS,FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,MUSIC",'My Name Is Suzie Ungerleider' Showcases the Singer-Songwriter as Her Truest Self,,"After more than two decades as roots singer-songwriter Oh Susanna,  Suzie Ungerleider   disavowed that moniker  due to its namesake song's association with racist imagery and a dehumanizing belief system. That change is reflected on the title of this album, a work that confirms Ungerleider's talent no matter what name she goes under.    All 10 songs here are Ungerleider originals, with Blue Rodeo's Bazil Donovan contributing to the one co-write here, ""Sweet Little Sparrow."" Inspired by Donovan's young daughter, the tune is an album highlight, with Ungerleider's voice taking on a softer timbre that works beautifully. Ungerleider's own daughter is the focus of two other tracks, ""Summerbaby"" and ""Hearts."" The former is another gem, a lovely ode to a newborn (""You had my heart wrapped up in your tiny little fingers"") with a lullabye feel thanks to judiciously employed strings.     Opening track ""Mount Royal"" continues the memoir approach of Ungerleider's previous album, the acclaimed 2017 release  A Girl in Teen City , but moves the setting from Vancouver to Montreal (""She was always shooting pool down on St. Laurent""). ""North Star Sneakers"" has a similar autobiographical feel: ""After the prom, you rode the coast on your motorcycle / Barely stopping for a chat with the customs man / You never mentioned all the hash sewn inside your collar.""     Ungerleider's long-established skill as a poetic lyricist is showcased vividly throughout. The sparse piano ballad ""Disappear"" depicts domestic violence (""I put my hands over my face / So he will disappear / Into the dark, into the dark""), while the imagery of ""Pumpkins"" captures the feel of autumn perfectly — ""The smell of smashed pumpkins still fresh in the air / And all the fall colours were streaks in your hair.""     Her voice remains a thing of beauty. Powerful yet restrained, it conveys melancholy and joy with equal grace. This is not an instrument requiring much embellishment, so some of the production touches here (the backing vocals on ""Pumpkins,"" and the swelling strings on ""Baby Blues"") seem a mite superfluous.     Returning as producer and multi-instrumentalist here is Ungerleider's longtime collaborator,  Jim Bryson , while the peer respect she has long enjoyed is reflected in an elite guest list of players and harmony vocalists, including Samantha Parton, Keri Latimer, Donovan, Peter Von Althen, Kevin Fox and Cam Giroux.        My Name Is Suzie Ungerleider  stands as another compelling chapter in a now double-figure discography with few equals in Canadian roots music.

2021-08-12,Jonathan St. Michael,7,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Pink Siifu's 'GUMBO'!' Balances Its Many Flavours,,"Pink Siifu , born Livingston Matthews, has become an enigmatic and rising figure in the world of hip-hop. Siifu's approach to his craft is varied and explorative; while earlier releases revolved around jazzy production and nondescript raps, last year's explosive and culturally poignant  NEGRO  leaned heavily into its punk tendencies.    Siifu's latest release,  GUMBO'! , sets its sights on new territory, tapping into elements of trap and exploring layers of Southern-styled neo-soul. Siifu's soundscapes are rich and eclectic, drawing influence from the likes of OutKast, Sun Ra and Bad Brains, and often redefine the boundaries that surround his music. Whatever style Siifu decides to dive into, he explores it without setting limitations. From the jazz-leaning raps of earlier releases to  NEGRO 's more abrasive sounds, Siifu's artistic approach is undeniably fresh. ""I'm gonna try to make all of this shit before I die,"" Siifu stated in  a recent Stereogum interview , "" so I don't ever want n****s to get stale with this shit.""     GUMBO'! , in its entirety, is far from stale, mixing soul-tinged melodies and jazz samples alongside Southern-influenced trap beats and bass-heavy production, the style flowing leisurely from murky instrumentals to soulful R&B tracks. With ease, Siifu swings and sways through deconstructed hip-hop and neo-soul to create a unique sound that exemplifies his unbridled approach to music.    On ""SMILE (wit yo Gold),"" lush guitar and warm percussion create a hazy backdrop of soul and funk, with Siifu's vocals crooning smoothly over the unhurried beat. Similarly, album opener ""Gumbo'! 4 tha Folks, Hold On,"" which features the vocal talents of Liv.e, Nick Hakim, Big Rube and V.C.R, is rhythmic and subdued, wrapping the group's husky vocals with producer DJ Harrison's warped synth leads. While this neo-soul sound is present throughout the album,  GUMBO'!  bounces quickly between this style and heavier tracks like ""Wayans Bros."" and ""Roscoe'!"", which both sound like they could be cuts from  NEGRO .     While varied, the sounds on  GUMBO'!  don't feel out of place, but rather stand as an homage to the Southern mystique that surrounds Pink Siifu and the music he takes influence from. Overall, the album reflects Siifu's desire for creative growth and the freedom to approach his music without restriction. And although  GUMBO'!  does move with some inconsistency, Siifu nevertheless delivers a dynamic approach to his craft.

2021-08-13,Anthony Boire,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Killers' 'Pressure Machine' Is Like 'Hillbilly Elegy' but Good,,"The Killers , a band once synonymous with the post-punk revival in the early '00s, have gone full dad rock — more specifically, Bruce Springsteen-flavoured Americana dad rock. Many artists have attempted this Hail Mary before, but it's often desperate, underbaked and simply sleepy. In contrast, the Killers have found their true calling.    Since the mixed reception for vocalist  Brandon Flowers ' sophomore solo record, 2015's  The Desired Effect , something seems to have woken up in these alt-rockers-turned-stadium giants. After 2017's danceable but tentative  Wonderful Wonderful , Flowers and co. have landed on a one-two punch of records that easily rank among their best. With COVID coinciding with last year's  Imploding the Mirage , a fist-pumping, rousingly written heartland rock gem, the Killers were left with hit after hit and nowhere to play. Instead, they retreated to Flowers' hometown of Nephi, Utah and wrote the follow-up to  Mirage . Those tracks have finally arrived in the form of  Pressure Machine , a slow, sometimes mournful and epic concept record about Nephi, and in many ways, every small town in much of America. It's easy to call  Pressure Machine  the  Nebraska  to last year's  Born to Run , but that would be ignoring the powerful and heartbreaking connection the Killers nurture to the town inspiring this record.     Nearly every song begins with a short snippet of interviews with real citizens of Nephi — here we meet blue-collar workers, single mothers and people juggling everyday life with crushing opioid addictions.  Pressure Machine  does not shy away from the connections between these towns, frozen in time, and the drugs that have wounded them even further. It's not just the train that ""kills someone every year or two,"" or the ""hillbilly heroin pills""; it's this entire way of life dying on the vine. Flowers paints the heart-wrenching connection between mental illness and the decline of the middle class in ""Terrible Thing"" and ""Desperate Things,"" and he treats every character, real or imagined, with a tenderness and love absent from so many hollow songs about towns like Nephi.    The Killers find in themselves a well of compassion here, and they announce as much on opener ""West Hills,"" which is the closest thing to a masterpiece the band has recorded since the  somehow-still-charting ""Mr. Brightside.""  Harmonica, mandolin and country strings blend together with their singular blend of alt-rock and synth-pop to build an absolutely massive sound. Flowers is hesitant to discuss politics (and historically, his Mormon faith) directly, but he comes closer than ever here. But rather than pointing fingers, Flowers begs for apolitical empathy from anyone listening to his pleading stories about this ""Quiet Town.""     Machine  falters, if only slightly, just after halfway into the record. ""In The Car Outside"" and ""In Another Life"" feel like afterthoughts from  Mirage  — they're excellent tunes, but the fist-pumping synths and classic Killers choruses are jarring when compared to the stark beauty of the rest of the album. If the album had dropped any singles before its release, surely these two would be the no-brainer candidates. It seems bad form to dance to a synth line that recalls ""When You Were Young"" when it's sandwiched between songs about workers being crushed by the titular  Pressure Machine .    The experiment has succeeded wildly, and the Killers need to own their new form. They've aged into something more pensive, monumental and vital. The party is over, and we need these empathetic folktales much more than any of us need to dance. For that, we have  Imploding the Mirage . And  Hot Fuss , obviously.

2021-08-16,Cole Brocksom,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,EP,ALBUM,MUSIC",Cartel Madras Take Their Alt-Rap Creativity to the Next Level on 'The Serpent & the Tiger',,"Calgary-based alternative rap duo  Cartel Madras  are back with the third and final instalment of their  Project Goonda  trilogy of EPs,  The Serpent & the Tiger .  The EP is a showcase of everything that makes Cartel Madras unique, presented in full force across 10 tracks. The duo, made up of sisters Eboshi and Contra, are really flexing their versatility as artists on this project.    The myriad sounds they've explored throughout their discography are present here, often being taken a step further. Those sounds range in everything from alt-rap, trap and drill to techno and house, with influences from punk and traditional Tamil music coming through across their music. Originally hailing from Chennai, India, the duo have dubbed their eclectic sound ""goonda rap,"" from a South Asian term for ""gangster"" or ""thug."" And with this trilogy being the blueprint, goonda rap goes hard, especially on  The Serpent & the Tiger .    Eboshi and Contra use everything in their toolbox as rappers on this EP. ""DRIFT"" shows off the duo's technical skills with rapid-fire flows packed to the brim with interior rhyme schemes, while both ""WORKING"" and  ""Dream Girl Concept""  slow things down for some chilled-out verses about being confident and empowered. Meanwhile, other cuts show Cartel Madras unafraid to dig deeper. On ""EBOSHI'S NEVADA,"" Eboshi describes the heartbreak of a relationship ending, of taking things too far and not knowing how to say how she really feels, while ""LAVENDER NIGHTZ"" has verses from both sisters about overcoming insecurities and getting past toxic people who try to keep you down. While Cartel Madras pull off rapping about getting money and getting laid well, as they do elsewhere on the EP, it's less impactful than the more vulnerable topics they discuss on these two tracks.    The EP also features a trio of strong guest verses, the most notable of which is  Backxwash 's appearance on ""DEEPINTHEJUNGLE,"" a heady alt-rap song that wouldn't feel out of place on a JPEGMAFIA project. The sisters' deadpan delivery of cold-blooded bars like ""Never humble I'm always alarming / Try to start a fight but these bitches stay sparring / Appetite for destruction and I'm always starving"" contrast nicely with Backxwash's distorted, pummelling flows. Chopped-up choir samples sting in between hard, clipping beats and a sinister 808 bassline, creating a cold, razor-sharp texture. The track is a centrepiece for the EP, which shifts from hard-as-nails bangers to a four-track run of smooth, sexy house tunes.    Production-wise,  The Serpent & the Tiger  brings an impressive diversity of sounds across the 10 tracks to match Eboshi and Contra's versatile spitting, with the help of a handful of producers including Dom Dias, Naphi and Jide. The first leg of the EP hits the ground running with some of the hardest tracks the duo have released, such as ""FEAR & LOATHING"" and ""The Green Scare,"" the latter of which is a heart-pounding drill song driven by 808s and traditional drum samples. While some of Cartel Madras' earlier work has toyed with house influences in high-energy, driving dance beats, recent singles ""WORKING"" and ""Dream Girl Concept"" show off a softer, more chic sound. They push this sound even further on ""LAVENDER NIGHTZ,"" and ""CONTRABAND,"" which feel like they should be soundtracking a high-end fashion show or an artsy club for young socialites, thanks in no small part to Tyris White's production.    The EP's variety results in some weaker moments, such as closing track ""MOON DRILLE,"" which falters by virtue of it being a serviceable pop-rap song. The flows are tight and Shiro Jackson's feature is solid, but as a closer, the song feels a little flat and out of place when all the other tracks have been so pumped full of Cartel Madras's charisma. The song has legs, but it stands out because it doesn't stand out — it sounds like it could have come from anyone, rather than being uniquely Cartel Madras.    Ultimately, Cartel Madras bring more than enough energy, character and attitude to make  The Serpent & the Tiger  a must-listen.

Infinite Granite  is markedly less metal than previous releases, but the band's restraint with their ferocity only makes those moments more impactful when they appear. Much of the record moves through momentous shoegaze and alt-rock woven together with luminous hues of blue. Vocalist George Clarke has expanded his range, often singing with elongated feather-light words that flow with soothing colour, and on  Infinite Granite , screams are rare and tactically used. Clarke  has said he found inspiration  for his melodic vocals in artists like Nina Simone, Chet Baker and Tears for Fears, and what he's come to stylistically complements the band's new dynamics.    For  Infinite Granite , Deafheaven chose to work with a different producer than on previous records. Justin Meldal-Johnsen, who's produced for artists like M83, Paramore and Metric, presents Deafheaven's heady world through a vivid frame. Clarke's lyrics still pull human dilemmas and experiences through an abstract poetic lens, like the open questions and personal truths of ""Great Mass of Color,"" where he sings, ""Do I need this affection? Do you? / Do you need this confusion? Do you? / Living trapped inside this body / Soft, haunted, waiting, wanting / Measured change evades real healing / Taking love with little reason."" The clarity of Clarke's vocals make it so the lyrics play a more revealing role, and are affective in a different way – his often-wistful tone drifting comfortably amongst silvery, searching guitar lines.    Similar to many of Deafheaven's songs from previous collections, most of  Infinite Granite 's tracks are epic suites that flow between pensive and climactic moments, evoking emotions through evolving and immersive sonic layers. In ""Shellstar"" and ""Lament for Wasps,"" guitars chime, whirl and drape roaring distortion around energetic drums. Clarke's vocals are their prettiest in ""Villain"" before leading into one the album's grandest choruses and the first hit of the Deafheaven that some are probably waiting for, as immense guitars blast skyward and black metal screams rip through.    Christopher Johnson's bass and Daniel Tracy's intricately broadened and busy drumwork give the album grounded versatility, while Kerry McCoy and Shiv Mehra's whirling astral guitars and waves of noise provide its dreamy radiance and add to its heft. ""Great Mass of Color"" packs some of the collection's most indelible hooks and melodies. ""Mombasa"" progresses from acoustic fingerpicking into blissful notes and swirling synth, through a subdued chorus and into Clarke's black metal vocals that flare up with tumultuous guitars and relentless drums.    Prominent on its cosmic cover art, in its lyrics and tone,  Infinite Granite  is remarkably blue, and beautifully so. Some fans might not appreciate the direction the band has taken towards the light, but nevertheless, the heart of Deafheaven remains. Deafheaven's fury and anguish has always had a companion in melancholy, introspection and their openness to explore. On  Infinite Granite , they continue that journey, softening, brightening, and elevating themselves to shimmering cerulean skies, sometimes still pulling through storms, at home in a new world.

2021-08-17,Alan Ranta,8,"POP AND ROCK,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Badge Epoch's 90-Minute 'Scroll' Would Be a Mess in Lesser Hands,,"The latest instalment in the ever-expanding  Slim Twig  universe sees mastermind Max Turnbull step out from his  Badge Époque Ensemble . Turnbull envisioned  Scroll  as a more personal expression than his work with the entire group, hence the slight name tweak to  Badge Epoch . In 2017, he began compiling tracks as a sort of journaling device, poaching the tastiest treats from his creative archives that didn't quite make it into his myriad of psychedelic projects. The resulting release could be considered a kind of documentary soundtrack that traces his recent evolution and creative process.    Of course, the usual suspects are still here.  The Cosmic Range ,  Tony Price ,  Michael Rault  and the actual Badge Époque Ensemble all appear, among others. It's worth the time to check out everything that everyone in the credits has done for their own ""solo"" projects, including all things Turnbull has done as Slim Twig or with  Darlene Shrugg  and  U.S. Girls .  Scroll  is like the  Black Widow  film of the Twigverse. You can enjoy it on its own, but there are entire TV and movie series behind this thing that provide a rich bed of context for each other.    Case in point, sprawling across a feature-length 90 minutes,  Scroll  itself is kind of a kitchen sink beat tape cobbled together from about eight years of sessions, including many reworked abandoned U.S. Girls tracks. There are the sickest of progressive psych-funk jams like ""Galactic Whip"" and ""Please"" that sound like BADBADNOTGOOD going on a Funkadelic trip with Adrian Younge, delightfully interspersed with avant-garde interludes. These interludes evoke the abrasive atonality of Pierre Boulez as well as the early electronic and musique concrète experimentations of Edgard Varèse and Karlheinz Stockhausen; all of whom were thanked in the liner notes to  Freak Out!  by Frank Zappa and the Mothers, although  Uncle Meat  is a more apt comparison for this Badge Époque effort.    Indulging any of Twig's whim to the outer limits, there are lengthy tone poems throughout the  Scroll  tracklisting as well. ""You Will Find"" drags the charm of Belbury Poly through the stuttering minimalism of Oneohtrix Point Never. The loping expansiveness of ""Every Thought Is a Prayer"" sounds like Brian Eno crafting discreet loops for airports, while the transition from horror creep to pastoral pluck in ""Deers in the Cemetery"" unfolds as cinematically as a Clint Mansell score. The slow-churning ambient techno of ""Ask for a Void"" remarkably contrasts the uptempo dance-y beat and soaring Ratatat-esque harmonized guitar fuzz sizzle of ""Fruit Cocktail in Heavy Syrup."" Considering all of the jams, interludes, and experiments together as a whole, the album's overall flow brings to mind an instrumental version of the ground-breaking self-titled 1968 experimental rock album by Joseph Byrd's United States of America or one of Madlib's movie-themed  Beat Konducta  collections.    Given the staggering eclecticism of these instrumentals, if you didn't know that Max Turnbull was behind this thing, you might assume it's a sequel to Anthology Recordings' essential library music compilation  Unusual Sounds . The first third of the album sounds like El Michels Affair bandleader Leon Michels crate-digging for rare Stevie Wonder B-sides while the last third sounds like Scott Walker wreaking havoc at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In lesser hands,  Scroll  would be a half-baked hot mess, but this dish is al dente.

2021-08-18,Max Heilman,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Between the Buried and Me's 'Colors II' Is a Love Letter to Their Crowning Achievement,,"It's not braggadocious for  Between the Buried and Me  to acknowledge the significance of their 2007 album,  Colors . How can they not? It's a defining moment for this North Carolina band, and prog metal in general. BTBAM realized their ambitions with flying colors, and rode the momentum to other career highs over the next 14 years. Three years after the  Automata   duology, BTBAM have now tasked themselves with writing a direct follow-up to  Colors  — an unenviable position, surely, but  Colors II  succeeds as a love letter to a pivotal juncture in BTBAM's career.     Colors II  owns up to its status as the sequel to  Colors  in the BTBAM cinematic universe. To that effect, ""Monochrome"" and ""The Double Helix of Extinction"" function much like the original's ""Foam Born"" and ""Decade of Statues."" It's almost too similar — an attempt to freshen up their 2007 steez, guiding a piano ballad to technical death metal via a dazzling crescendo. It turns out to be a genius bait-and-switch for seasoned listeners, as the first breakdown in ""Helix"" subverts jackhammer eighth notes with a nasty swing groove.    BTBAM's lineup has remained constant, and so has their drive to create dynamic, destructive music. It's clear that every member enjoyed replenishing their creative juices. ""Revolution in Limbo"" finds the quintet pushing each other to the limit. Tommy Rogers' singing remains as poignant as his growls, as do Paul Waggoner and Dustie Waring's acoustic meditations, violent shred-fests and invigorating leads. Drummer Blake Richardson even contributes harsh vocals during the breakdown — like he doesn't have enough work cut out for him on tracks like ""Fix the Error.""    In the middle of a three-way drum battle between Mike Portnoy (ex- Dream Theater ), Navene Koperweis ( Animals as Leaders ) and Ken Schalk ( Candiria ), Richardson's performance still stands out. His boundless energy drives BTBAM from Motörhead and Deep Purple stylings to… DragonForce!? Power metal is a surprise, but a welcome one. The production gives heft to BTBAM's heaviness without drowning out their intricacies (even  Colors  struggled to pull this off). This works wonders for the sprawling ""Never Seen / Future Shock,"" as it juggles battle-hardened brutality, jaw-dropping switch-ups and arena-ready melodies.     Colors II  has no trouble beefing up its tech-death quotient while leaving room for campy electronic drums and Mr. Bungle-style weirdness to breathe. ""The Future Is Behind Us"" can punctuate the complexities of math-rock with disco orchestra hits while ending with an absolutely devastating breakdown. ""Bad Habits'' similarly indulges all elements of extreme prog-metal, effortlessly transitioning from blast beats to triumphant choruses to duels between organs and acoustic guitars.    Still, 79 minutes is a long time to maintain focus. ""Turbulent"" builds an expansive, propulsive soundscape over a hypnotic dance-pop loop, but the rising action winds up more predictable than thrilling. And for all its shimmering synths and wailing guitars, ""Sfumato"" feels more like an unnecessary pitstop before ""Human as Hell."" The hypnotic, pulsating crescendo of ""Stare into the Abyss"" might drag on, but that doesn't stop ""Prehistory"" from offering BTBAM's inexorable rhythmic cohesion. It's jazz/metal fusion in the truest sense, topped off by a country western boogie and a mind-blowing bass solo from Dan Briggs.    ""Human as Hell"" mirrors  Colors  closer ""White Walls"" — the new track begins sounding like a remix of its predecessor, kicking off 15 minutes of BTBAM firing on all cylinders. All of the elements of a climactic closer appear, including the catchiest melodies and the heaviest breakdown. The problem here is the flow of ideas rather than any issue with BTBAM's chops, as the track checks off the 'epic' box instead of providing a truly cathartic finish to a massive journey.    Then again, a sequel rarely pulls an  Empire Strikes Back .  Colors II  can still be plenty respectable without reaching or surpassing  Colors . It's certainly BTBAM's heaviest in a while, paying tribute to the BTBAM's watershed record without copy-pasting. It might fall short of wall-to-wall iconic status, but they already achieved that. They've earned the right to have fun making music together for those who've stuck around.

2021-08-19,Daniel Sylvester,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Martha Wainwright Strips Down Her Usual Theatricality on 'Love Will Be Reborn',,"Martha Wainwright  has never been shy about the fact that she comes from one of Canada's most famous musical lineages. She has recorded songs with her brother Rufus and aunt Anna McGarrigle, covered her father Loudon's songs, and has participated in tribute concerts for her late mother, Kate McGarrigle.    That's why it's no surprise that her latest,  Love Will Be Reborn , is an album about and dedicated to family — just not in the typical manner fans are used to. Produced by Pierre Marchand (who's recorded albums for her brother, mother and aunt), the album finds Wainwright moving away from her stark and confessional lyrics about love and lust. Instead, tracks like the quivering, twangy ""Getting Older"" and the skeletal ""Report Card"" find the Montreal musician tackling issues related to motherhood and domestic life. But this doesn't remove any of the passion from Wainwright's delivery, as she pushes her smoky voice beyond its limits on the adventurous title track and the playful and upbeat ""Hole in My Heart.""    As her past releases heavily featured well-selected guest musicians (particularly her last LP, 2016's  Goodnight City ) Wainwright recorded this album in the basement of her Montreal café, Ursa, with a band including Josh Cole of Vancouver jazz ensemble the October Trio and Thom Gill and Phil Melanson of Toronto indie-poppers Bernice. This has helped give songs like the surprisingly beefy ""Being Right"" and the soulful ""Body and Soul"" a more intimate feel than her previous releases. Working with Marchand has also brought out an earthy sound from Wainwright, as the pulsating album opener ""Middle of the Lake"" and the Stevie Nicks-esque belter ""Rainbow"" veer on alt-country's sense of dusty drama.    The album's closing track, ""Falaise de Malaise"" marks two firsts for Martha, as the song is sung completely in French and the piano accompaniment marks the first time she plays an instrument on an album, as her soaring voice usually fulfills that requirement. Though the tail end of the LP drags thanks to throwaway dirges like ""Justice"" and ""Sometimes,""  Love Will Be Reborn  is nonetheless as surprisingly and pleasingly intimate and stripped-down of an album you're going to hear from someone as naturally theatrical as Martha Wainwright.

2021-07-20,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,5,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Pop Smoke's Fans Won't Lose 'Faith' Despite Uneven New Posthumous Album,,"The posthumous album has sadly been a staple in hip-hop for years, occasionally resulting in legacy-cementing projects like J Dilla's immaculate  Donuts  and 2Pac's commercially successful  R U Still Down? (Remember Me) . Following these releases, however, those artists' discographies unfortunately dovetailed into a plethora of rehashed and rushed releases to bank on nostalgia. Similar scenarios have threatened to play out in rap's current era — acclaimed posthumous projects from the likes of Mac Miller and Juice WRLD have been followed by the dubious promise of more material to come thereafter.    The case of New York rapper  Pop Smoke  is no different.  Faith , his second posthumous release, lacks the direction provided by mentor 50 Cent, who executive-produced 2020's excellent  Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon . The absence of a cohesive structure is compounded by head-scratching features and suspect production choices, resulting in a lacklustre offering.    The best posthumous releases find the artist's collaborators making artistic decisions that the deceased would have approved of. This is almost never the case on  Faith , where producers Kanye West and Pharrell proceed to superimpose Pop Smoke's verses on their own creative endeavors. While Pusha T rarely misses in the lyrical department, there is no rationale for having the Virginia MC present on two tracks while Pop's fellow Brooklyn drill scenester and frequent collaborator Fivio Foreign misses the cut. ""Manslaughter,"" featuring Rick Ross and singer The-Dream, should have been a baritone-voiced match made in heaven, but the overbearing strings drown out any semblance of Pop's sombre presence. Thinned-out production and rough vocal captures ruin ""Bout a Million,"" when the 21 Savage and 42 Dugg features actually made sense.    ""Brush Em,"" ""Beat the Speaker"" and ""Coupe"" all sound like classic Pop Smoke, while ""What's Crackin,"" featuring Takeoff, seems like one of the few songs that could have fit on a proper Pop Smoke project. While Pop's loyal fans will find solace in the raw and uncut ""Woo Baby Interlude,"" they will undoubtedly be frustrated with ""Demeanor,"" an improbable duet with pop singer Dua Lipa.    But, despite poor production choices and lazy song structures, Pop Smoke's energy and solo spurts of brilliance won't allow for this stale posthumous release to tarnish his legacy.

2021-07-21,Yoshi Maclear Wall,8,"JAZZ,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Emma-Jean Thackray's 'Yellow' Is Too Exciting to be Merely Branded ""Jazz Fusion""",,"One hesitates to pin  Yellow ,  Emma-Jean Thackray 's official debut full-length, down with a reductive label such as ""jazz fusion."" The genre name isn't really indicative of much except the act of fusing the jazz tradition with something else (even the ""jazz"" label is contentious, particularly as of late) and relying on such an empty descriptor does this music a disservice.    Part of what makes this album so irreducible and magical is the variety of Thackray's stylistic ingredients. Much like the rest of the London fusion renaissance currently taking place, the influences of funk, hip-hop and dance permeate nearly every composition. There are also a few refreshing detours scattered throughout, such as the irresistible gospel breakdown of the title track and the Bond-movie splendor of ""Spectre.""    As with many of her innovative peers (Moses Boyd, Nubya Garcia), Thackray uses these influences as a vehicle to realize the many facets of her vision. Sure, a track may begin as a seemingly conventional take on the British scene, but by the end, the listener is plunged into a glorious eruption of sound. The rhythm section enters full-throttle jam mode, the horns wail on assertive ostinatos, the orchestra detonates and Thackray clones her voice into a million Thackrays. Any arbitrary barriers that exist between genres are vanquished in the tidal wave of her ingenuity. So much happens at once across the entire mix, and yet the sense of clarity remains astonishingly intact.    The lyrical content of  Yellow  is almost entirely utopian, making for a soul-cleansing and rousing experience. Thackray's pen game seeks to emotionally and spiritually engage the listener. She speaks in evocative, colorful imagery, which serves more to compliment and embellish the surrounding musical landscape than to function as a stand-alone message. There is often a literalism to the way she tackles themes, as ""Third Eye"" asks the listener to ""raise your consciousness with your third eye,"" and a George Clinton-esque request demanding the ""green funk"" is uttered throughout a track fittingly titled ""Green Funk.""    At the center of her opus is an astronomical motif, with the most dynamic compositions featuring choirs shouting the names of celestial bodies, beautifully blending Sun Ra's interstellar motifs with Thackray's spiritual influences. Refrains such as ""hands up and reach for the sky, the sun gives life"" and ""I call to Venus in the sky, she shows me loooooooove!"" double both as rallying cries for humanity and an appeal to a higher power.    The album's tidings of hope and unity offer comforting escapism from a world that can feel devoid of those things. Admittedly, the general sentiment can sometimes border on saccharine, and perhaps even feel slightly unsettling near the end (the monotonous chanting in ""Our People"" feels like the musical equivalent of being indoctrinated into a cult). However, it's never quite enough to take away from the generally mesmerizing experience.     The sheer ambition of the project is impressive — even more so how this ambition has been successfully fulfilled by Thackray's impeccable work as an arranger and producer. The way she navigates the plethora of vocal tracks in particular, making them feel as pristine as possible, is a startling achievement. In addition, Thackray's multi-instrumental wizardry and Dougal Taylor's often frenetic percussion shine throughout, doing much to establish compelling tension within the music. Despite the abundance of compositional ideas, they are all executed with attention to clarity, cohesion and detail. Thackray's auteurist approach in the studio combined with her peerless precision and control feel like a whole new genre unto itself.  (Movementt)                           JAZZ   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Emma-Jean Thackray",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/emma_jean_thackray_yellow_album_review
2021-07-22,Megan LaPierre,8,"R&B,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Erez Zobary Blossoms into Herself on 'To Bloom',,"For Toronto's  Erez Zobary , making music has long been about healing. Working through debilitating vocal nodules and stage fright has all been par for the course in the 24-year-old's journey. Even without that context, her latest project  To Bloom  sounds like a triumph. Coming in crisply just under the 20-minute mark, it's introspective, melodic self-empowerment pop; a testament to the power of retrospect and the messy, non-linearity of growth as Zobary explores her identity in the context of relationships.     To Bloom  marks the follow-up to 2019's  July Clouds . Zobary made both collections alongside longtime friends and collaborators Adam Eisen and David Lipson. Two Julys later, she finds more clarity and more self-assurance, assisted by Lipson's forays into more intricate, synth-laden electronic flourishes and nuanced use of vocal effects.    Eschewing a typical heartbreak-to-new-love narrative,  To Bloom  begins in the thick of it on the melancholic lead single ""How,"" a meditative piano ballad. By ""Saku""— the album's funk-driven centrepiece, named after Zobary's favourite downtown Toronto sushi restaurant — she's bright-eyed with the rush of opening herself back up to love, with her childhood influences of  Stevie Wonder  and  Amy Winehouse  fully on display.    The energetic peak comes at the album's close, with the fiery disco of ""Breathe You Out."" After having journeyed through the flux and flow of loss and moving on, Zobary is at her most confident in spite of the new connection not quite panning out. Grounded in her sense of self is, her affirmation in the hopeful excitement of ""Saku"" echoes back: ""I'm going to see myself in all my glory now."" Marking the beginning of Zobary's next chapter, it hints at her potential to occupy similar sonic realms to  Jessie Ware ,  Dua Lipa  and other dance-pop disco-revivalists.     While many self-empowerment anthems tend to be laborious attempts at being 'inspirational,' Zobary just  is . Simply sharing her own experiences and singing her progress into existence may prompt self-reflection through the vehicle of her thoughtful songwriting and vocal delivery. This is not an escapist venture: it's the kind of music you live alongside and go through the motions with. Zobary's refrains — like the whir of ""Was it the name? / Was it the mention? / Was it the sound of good intention?"" on ""Stair Song"" — hang in the air like mantras. Likewise,  To Bloom  only gets better with repetition.    When Zobary closes ""Saku"" with ""I'm getting better / but I need someone who's self-assured,"" one may be left to wonder whether she's referring to a potential partner or herself.  To Bloom  makes it feel like she's accomplished the latter after having dug through the topsoil: carving out an adaptable-yet-distinct lane of empower-pop and solidifying herself as  a budding artist to watch .

2021-07-23,Luke Fox,7,"SOUL & FUNK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Leon Bridges' 'Gold-Diggers Sound' Is Informed by the Past but Styled for the Now,,"Somewhere between the 10 p.m. coffees and 10 a.m. tequilas,  Leon Bridges  found a groove. Recorded during two years' worth of all-night jam sessions at the East Hollywood studio/dance bar/boutique hotel of the same name,  Gold-Diggers Sound  is a lean and refined R&B project. Crisp and classy as its milky-voiced maestro, Bridges described his third full-length in a press release as his ""most sensual and confident album to date,"" and it would be difficult to disagree. We're betting the tequila was top shelf and the coffee a step above diner drip.    Bridges' upbeat revivalist soul-stomping debut, 2015's  Coming Home , put him on the map (and remains his most fun listen). Then Atlanta-born, Texas-bred singer-songwriter busted out of the retro box with 2018's eclectic (and, perhaps, scattered)  Good Thing , which delved into disco, funk and pop. Having established his musical and vocal range, the 32-year-old Grammy winner zeroes in on laying down a pure R&B platter.  Gold-Diggers Sound  is informed by the past but styled for the now.    Bridges loves a good love song, and nails a few here. In the slinky groove of ""Details,"" he pores over every nuance of his muse, like ""how you pause when you talk when you tryin' not to laugh."" While Bridges' lyric sheets keep the affairs PG, his tone on the sultry ""Sho Nuff"" or ""Steam"" — a dance-floor seduction that would fit snugly in the '80s — leaves enough breath for R-rated imagination. Lead single ""Motorbike"" is a spur-of-the-moment romantic getaway in which our hero's voice quavers fragile like riding his escape vehicle of choice without a helmet. If there's a Miguel influence bubbling here, we're not mad at it.     Musically, producers Ricky Reed and Nate Mercereau toss in touches of Afrobeat (""Born Again""), sunny jazz and falsetto flits (""Magnolias""), plus cinematic strings (pain-swallowing closer ""Blue Mesas""). The most ambitious efforts are saved for the back half of the LP:  ""Sweeter""  — a response to anti-Black police brutality released in the days after George Floyd's death — stands firm as the album's masterpiece. Even though Bridges performed the song at the Democratic National Convention, the thing still stirs with melancholy, defiance and hope.    ""Don't Worry,"" a sprawling and hopeful breakup duet with Ink, delivers a welcome contrast in voices.Its six-and-a-half-minute runtime doubles the length of nearly every other track on  Gold-Diggers , allowing for country twang to evolve into Dixie horn blasts. Like Bridges' career itself, it's smooth and collaborative, and will keeps everyone on their toes, not knowing what sound will come next.

2021-07-26,Tom Beedham,9,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Halluci Nation Turn Anti-Colonialism into a Celebratory Dance Party for 'One More Saturday Night',,"Formalizing the declaration of  A Tribe Called Red 's 2016 album  We Are the Halluci Nation  by adopting it as their new name,  the Halluci Nation  ride again, speakers and decks set for  One More Saturday Night .    The title echoes the group's biweekly Electric Pow Wow events that preceded their efforts to create original music, but it also lends itself to an entire world of associations, plugging into the celebratory all-night, capitalism-escaping energy of dancefloors all around the planet, promising at least one more party. If  We Are the Halluci Nation  was the boundary-leaping sound of a group uniting a global network of actors and voices,  One More Saturday Night  is about sustaining those connections — work that can be harder and more important — all while imagining opportunities for future growth and new interventions.    Late Indigenous rights activist and poet John Trudell returns in the record's opening track, ""Remember 01,"" telling of the importance of a voice that can ""reach from the ancient to the futuristic while it passes through the present."" It's a visionary epigraph and a tone setter for a record that's immediately hazier and lighter than  Halluci Nation 's weightiness, setting things in motion to booming powwow drums, trickling trap snares, declarative brass and the righteous calls of the Black Bear singers, one of four ""Remember"" tracks scattered throughout the album that eventually incorporate echoing dub, stuttering STLNDRMS compositions, and the powwow sounds of Chippewa Travellers.    These sepia-toned sequences frame the record as an attempt to breathe new life into a memory or a dream that settler colonialism and its extractive violence have attempted to erase: a time without colonial interference, but also formative instances of anti-colonial revelation. On an album full of galvanizing moments that hold truth to power, they provide centring moments that give clarity and space for the objectives of their affirmations to take root: reclamation of land and resources, collaboration in the place of appropriation, and the preservation of excellence and joy outside of and in opposition to settler-colonial visions.    A third of the 15 tracks that make up  One More Saturday Night  (""Ba Na Na,"" ""The OG,"" ""Land Back,"" ""Tanokumbia"" and a remix of Keith Secola's ""NDN Kars"") were originally offered as singles while the group were still operating under their previous banner, but their inclusion here feels fundamental to the album's zoned-in mode, anchoring the project to a kind of borderless, historical continuum of ancestral knowledge that resists oppressive revisionism — the group's former name preserved in the track listing, even barked off top-of-track by guest  Haviah Mighty .     There's no obscuring where the Halluci Nation came from because it's how they got where they are now, shedding light on shared continuities and celebrating the connective rhythms. It makes just as much sense for the group to be in dialogue with a defiant country anthem as it does for them to get down with Haviah Mighty and  Odario  on a Caribana love-in. Dancehall and reggaeton's influence is woven deep into this album's tapestry, strutting dembow syncopations lending thrust and swagger to standout tracks like ""Tanokumbia,"" ""Land Back,"" and ""The OG."" Both ""NDN Kars"" and ""Ba Na Na"" are the result of a shared class consciousness — an acknowledgment of diaspora and a defiant effort to lessen its distancing.    Where much of dance music is about abandon,  One More Saturday Night  is necessarily entangled in additional abandonment. The trauma of colonialism is ongoing, so when the 2018 soundbite from former NDP MP and Cree lawmaker Romeo Saganash's parliamentary truth bomb about Justin Trudeau (""Why doesn't the prime minister just say the truth and tell Indigenous peoples that he doesn't give a fuck about their rights?"") drops deep into the album on 2019 track ""The OG,"" it feels just as skewering as it is imbued with new resonance, especially after Saganash doubled down on his words in  a March 2021 interview with APTN .    The Halluci Nation don't shoulder the responsibility of solving the predicaments of capital-indebted culture. Instead, they task themselves with facilitating collective dreaming, jamming records full with collaborators or connecting multiple generations on a single track (on ""Mother Mother,"" elder dub poet Lillian Allen meets bars from Gitxsan emcee the Northwest Kid and a scorching Afropunk blues meltdown from  SATE ).

2021-07-27,Kyle Kohner,6,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Bleachers Shakily Tries to Be the Boss on 'Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night',,"The trail of desire that leads to  Jack Antonoff , writer and producer of some of the biggest pop albums released within the past decade, is a perplexing phenomenon to follow. Aside from being a songwriter unafraid to feel and express things loud and proud, what is it about Antonoff that makes him the most sought-after record producer alive? Is it ingenuity and a forward-thinking production style that constantly pushes the envelope? No, that's not Jack. Antonoff as a songwriter and producer is an agreeable safe bet who caters his own one-man-band talents to each and every artist he finds himself producing for.    Sure, his knack for an unstoppably catchy hook and boisterous, stadium-rocking arrangements will show itself now and then, but he's the ultimate collaborator who allows an individual's unique gifts and creativity to flow. In  an interview with  Billboard , Taylor Swift says it best when asked about what it's like working with the New Jersey producer: ""There is a boundless enthusiasm in the way Jack makes music, and it's an absolutely irresistible quality to find in a collaborator."" Whether that's devising a musically sparse atmosphere for Lana Del Rey's spontaneous poetry and wry humor, pushing Swift to embrace her directness, or endlessly refining a synth-drenched dance environment for a perfectionist like Lorde, Antonoff helps bring out the best in others, but to a degree deprived of any real signature that demands attention and acclaim.    That's not necessarily an indictment against Antonoff, who does what he loves and does it well — helping others realize their dreams and producing loud, infectious pop music that makes frequenters of Urban Outfitters say ""This is a vibe."" But because the level of demand surrounding his name suggests he's doing something exceptional and ground-breaking, it's only reasonable to hope and wait for him to deliver a record that validates its own hype; a project that could build a logical bridge between Antonoff the collaborator and Antonoff the musician.     Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night , Antonoff's third album as  Bleachers , is at best a heartfelt batch of tracks that are nice to experience in the moment, but rarely anytime after. This doesn't mean there aren't a few glimpses of the full potential of Bleachers' musical direction; they're just crowded by much of the same heard on records past. Blatant choruses and the aural impression of a 10-piece ensemble return as Bleachers' calling cards — Antonoff's latest, at worst, lacks stylistic risks. He continues to churn out a homogenized slew of soaring synth-pop simplicity that could easily be placed within the context of any prior Bleachers' project, but this time filtered through the lens of his childhood heroes — particularly one Mr. Bruce Springsteen.    Similar to Springsteen's adored 1984 album  Born in the U.S.A. , Antonoff's  Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night  is full of big leaping choruses that'll shake arenas, vocals that yearn through a haze of reverb, and guitars that swoon with heartland spirit. Not that this is anything new for Antonoff — Springsteen's influence was present as early as 2014's ""Rollercoaster."" The genre-specific sonics are admirably by-the-book on  Take the Sadness , but  Born in the U.S.A. 's boisterous snares and synth-ladened sonics throughout were really just there to draw the attention of the masses — the album's dark socio-political underbelly is what made it so essential. Springsteen made a danceable record and said something important along the way; a balance of contrasts carried with command. The same can't be said for  Take the Sadness  cuts like ""Chinatown"" and ""45,"" where Antonoff merely fashions this aesthetic around vague sentiments about himself, his life, and a breakup with his famous ex, rather than the toiling world-at-large.     When not channelling Springsteen, Antonoff fills the gaps with driving, fast-tempo indie pop, such as the Vampire Weekend-esque ""How Dare You Want More,"" which incorporates an upbeat jolt of jaunty acoustic guitars, rolling drums, and lively saxophone licks. It still falls in line with Antonoff's euphoric sound, complete with endlessly shoutable chorus.    The album does, however, feature a few examples of what makes Antonoff's songwriting so special. Album opener ""91"" throws a curveball from the get-go by experimenting with baroque pop arrangements, as do the final two tracks ""Strange Behavior"" and ""What'd I Do With All This Faith."" None of these three songs crescendo into a big cathartic explosion and there's no sight of overproduced nostalgia. Instead, intimate singer-songwriter qualities, gorgeous horn sections and twinkly string staccatos culminate into a more intimate approach than the anthemic surroundings of the album's remainder.    Hearing Antonoff's voice boosted by delicate instrumental subtleties and unhindered by layers of reverb, may very well be the most refreshing development from  Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night . He comes across as a complex individual with complex emotions. ""Strange Behavior"" paints Antonoff as an intense poet, pining for meaning during a chaotic time: ""This just a shadow / What you thought was faith / That was hollow / Look at you / You've been chasing shadows / That's why you wake up in two."" Moments like these, whether they be musical or lyrical, may very well be just enough to justify that ""it"" factor that continues to charm the biggest names in pop music, even if it doesn't fully translate across the whole album.

2021-07-27,Wesley McLean,8,"SOUL & FUNK,R&B,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Prince's 'Welcome 2 America' Is a Fantastic Album He Probably Wouldn't Want You to Hear,,"In the modern music landscape, few things are as polarizing as the posthumous release. Most of the time, unfinished music gets pieced together and rushed out for major record labels to profit off an artist's passing, discarding their vision and leaving fans conflicted as the label lines their pockets. Despite that, every so often, a posthumous album is given the proper care and respect by the team handling it, as they cater to the artist's original vision delivering a beautiful send-off for a fallen icon. The latest posthumous release from the legendary  Prince  exists somewhere in the middle.     Welcome 2 America  was initially produced in 2010 — it's unclear exactly why the album was initially shelved but, given that that time period was a low point in Prince's career as a studio artist, the possibilities are endless. Between the battles with labels, obscure methods of distributing his music and a string of lacklustre albums that was punctuated by 2010's  20TEN , it makes sense that maybe he needed to take a step back and re-evaluate things — but it's a shame that he did.      Welcome 2 America  is a fantastic record. From the outset, its atmosphere is smooth, sexy, funky and cosmic as Prince casts an ominous and revealing light on America and its true nature in the modern world. Even though this album was recorded throughout the 2000s and completed 11 years ago, it's an incredibly relevant work that shows just how transcendental Prince remains five years after his death. As an artist, he'd transcended almost any label cast upon him — he defied the gender binary and created music without genre — but after hearing this, it's clear that he transcends time. The stories and made observations on his surroundings that he made on this album are even more relevant today than when they were recorded.    It's an incredibly impressive collection of songs, especially considering the era in which it was initially set to be released. It's a nearly flawless tracklist, with the only real weak point being ""1010 (Rin Tin Tin),"" though it's not quite bad enough to ruin the experience or break up the album's flow. For an artist who was seemingly in a pretty substantial lull, to be able to make what would've been easily his best album in decades just speaks to Prince's mastery of his craft — his decision to shelve it just speaks to how enigmatic a character he was.    Despite how fantastic this album is for the most part, there is an incredibly dark cloud cast over the music. This is due to the undeniable fact that Prince would never have wanted a label owning, distributing and profiting off of his art, and it's a sentiment that he expresses on this very LP. The track ""Running Game (Son of a Slave Master)"" sees Prince exploring his feelings on being a Black artist in the predominantly white music industry. He discusses the greed and deceit of record labels, describing the record executive as the ""son of a slave master, keeping it going."" It's a gorgeous, powerful track with lush, layered instrumentation from the funky bassline to plucky guitar riffs that echo throughout, accenting every lyric. It's a message that becomes even more powerful in the context of his third full-length posthumous release in less than four years.    This is where the disconnect with this record occurs. Prince was notoriously against record labels and the way they treat artists and their art as products for profit. Yet, since his death, the floodgates have opened on his mythical vault of unreleased music. We've seen the aforementioned three full-length posthumous releases —  Welcome 2 America , live album  Piano & a Microphone: 1983 , and demos collection  Originals  —  alongside expansive deluxe reissues of  1999   and  Purple Rain  (with over 80 unreleased songs and demos between them). It's a very clear disregard for the wishes of an artist who was known for being a meticulous perfectionist with an insurmountable level of talent and incredible vision.    This is the biggest thing going against an otherwise formidable piece of art, and it's neither Prince's nor the album's fault.  Welcome 2 America  is nothing short of incredible — it's a '70s funk- and soul-inspired ride that is equally rich in thought-provoking content and magnificent musical mastery. It's an album that had a clear vision and direction and was well on its way to completion when Prince passed, and it was put together incredibly well by Legacy Recordings afterward. But it's nevertheless conflicting to hear the emotion Prince puts into songs like the title track and ""Running Game (Son of a Slave Master)"" just to have himself proven right once again, with the release of that very music.     Welcome 2 America  is an incredible listen and an album that proves that even when Prince had reached his lowest point, he was still capable of creating magic. It's a tight, concise body of work that is a few missteps short of perfection but is still far and away his best release since 1987's  Sign o' the Times . Almost every song here is fully fleshed-out, with glorious, funk-driven instrumentation that takes cues from the classics while being injected with Prince's inimitable flare. It's a wonderful experience to hear 'new' Prince music that finds him in rare form once again — it just feels wrong knowing that he probably wouldn't want us to.

Originally surfacing from the city's fertile warehouse scene, the septet — driven by vocalist Kamilah Apong and bassist Jamie Kidd — ignited dance floors with their transcendent live show, a celebration indebted to the glory days of early disco that cleverly avoided pastiche thanks to the troupe's sheer talent and resolute devotion to a shamefully, all-too-often neglected chapter in music history.     Debut album  Fantast  fulfills the expectations of their 2018 EP  do you feel excited?  and other singles while seeing them broadening their soundscape, adding electro-funk, soulful house and boogie to their already infectious vibe. Album opener ""Wavy Baby,"" a mid-paced number awash in futuristic synthesizer, is a hypnotic invitation to rapture that's affirmed on the very next number, lead single ""Chrysalis,"" a carpe-diem rush of retro video game soundtracks fused with potent house drive.    On ""Don't Be Afraid,"" Apong channels unsung disco divas Venus Dodson and Christine Wiltshire while adding her own passionate flair as the track slowly builds into a gospel-influenced intensity sustained with backing vocals by Lydia Persaud, R-Flex, Shahi Teruko and Tafari Anthony. The reprise version of the track from later in the album, meanwhile, evokes the classic '80s production style of Patrick Adams and Leroy Burgess with its Roland 808 pulse and jazzy, Fender Rhodes chords. The song's message of resiliency, love and bravery aligns with disco's Black and queer origins — a narrative thread woven throughout the album by interludes featuring members of Apong's family from Black River, Jamaica.    While concerts are still an iffy proposition, ""Jessica F***"" is the album's finest showcase of Tush's joyous interplay recalling the fervour of their live performances — Kidd's pumping bass lines, endless grooves, scintillating rhythms and soaring vocals that would strip a venue's varnish in one night. ""My Joy"" closes the album with sunny reassurance over a churchy organ progression as Apong's loved ones join on backing vocals, turning the song's title into a mantra for troubled times.     Fantast  is an auspicious debut from an outfit that will be rocking dance floors for a long time.

It's inspired by  Saga Boy , his recently published memoir, which further connects the songs to his life story. While the book explains his border-hopping personal journey from Trinidad to Canada, the accompanying album is a foray into the breadth of Orpheus' genre-defying musical scope.     On ""IG,"" the opening track's impactful drums provide an energetic backdrop for Orpheus to showcase his strong songwriting, singing about persevering in the face of academic obstacles and geographical relocations. The themes in the album's songs reflect the memoir's diasporic origin story, while the regional influences are heard throughout the record. The omnipresent influence of the Caribbean is felt with ""We Nah Worry About Dat"" whilst a turbulent bass is grounded by the Calypso sample on ""Carnival."" Furthering the autobiographical nature of the project, Orpheus offers a parallel between his life story and the destinies of Fela Kuti and Bob Marley on  ""Fela Awoke (I Will Miss You).""  The importance of motherly figures and the quest to try to find a place to call home are mirrored in lyrics that comment on these musical legends' legacies.     The soulful ting of ""Mango Tree"" will speak to broader audiences and is a perfect sultry introduction for new fans to get into Orpheus' sound. Finally, in contrast with some of the more dense production, the simplicity of ""U Look Cute When U Smile"" feels refreshing and serves to close out  Saga King  on an upbeat note. Although it would be easy to qualify the record as an ode to summer on first listen, there is much more to unpack.    John Orpheus turns cliché terms like 'world music,' 'eclectic collage' and 'autobiographical' on their heads with his confident writing and delivery. This driven creative push is what carries this ambitious project and completes the book and album's one-two knockout. Ultimately, Orpheus weaves a familiar tale of travel, adversity and growth, but is wholly unique in his approach.

2021-08-04,Wesley McLean,9,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Isaiah Rashad Is at the Top of His Game on 'The House Is Burning',,"Top Dawg Entertainment has had a stranglehold on hip-hop for about a decade now, proving time and time again that their roster contains some of today's most creative and forward-thinking hip-hop and R&B artists. From SZA and ScHoolboy Q to Jay Rock and Kendrick Lamar, the label's output has consistently been tremendously successful and incredibly impactful, with Kendrick cementing his legacy as one of the greatest rappers to ever do it — but their roster has always had more to offer beyond just their biggest stars.     Since 2014,  Isaiah Rashad  has been the label's secret weapon, with his debut  Cilvia Demo  and his 2016 follow-up  The Sun's Tirade  being two of TDE's best projects thanks to Rashad's clear understanding of his strengths alongside his innate aptitude for creating and curating an atmosphere. With his latest project,  The House Is Burning , Rashad has delivered the most complete depiction of just how well those qualities come together.    Beyond just a style or a sound, there's a certain texture to every song on this LP that is unquestionable and undeniably Isaiah Rashad. His music manages to be distinctly and unapologetically Southern while basking in a hypnotic, borderline-psychedelic ambience, mixed in a way that makes it feel warmly lo-fi while also maintaining a crisp and precise sound quality that maximizes every aspect. His vision is so clear and concise that it brings every track together, creating an incredibly enjoyable experience that feels complete, thoroughly conceived and just as well executed.    This would be an impressive feat for any other album, but what makes  The House Is Burning  all the more impressive is that it does it all while juggling various features, shifts in style and changes in tempo without Rashad missing a step. Nothing on this album feels out of place, no matter how drastically different one song might be from another — it's sequenced  that  well. Even songs like the crunk-tinged lead single ""Lay Wit Ya"" featuring Duke Deuce or the Lil Uzi Vert-assisted banger ""From the Garden"" manage to feel right at home sandwiching the smooth, laidback ""RIP Young,"" regardless of the differences in tone and energy.    This isn't new for Rashad, but it's much more refined here. It's the result of years of mastering and perfecting his craft. He knows what sounds suit him, emphasizing his ability to use his voice as yet another instrumental layer whether rapping or singing. The album's fantastic production is elevated by Rashad's level of comfort, and the fluidity of his rapping and singing styles complement the beats perfectly.    It's normal for an artist who disappears for five years after an album to have a lot of heavy expectations placed upon them and their return, and in a lot of cases, that expectation becomes their greatest adversary. With  The House Is Burning , however, Isaiah Rashad has returned as sharp as ever, delivering an album that houses some of the best material that he's ever released. The album never lulls over its 16-track runtime; instead, it finds an artist who's taken his time away from the spotlight back in a good space, building upon an already strong foundation to result in with the most complete project he's released. Isaiah Rashad is now three for three, and only getting better.

2021-08-04,Rosemary Akpan,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Billie Eilish Might Not Sound 'Happier Than Ever,' but She Is — You Have to Trust Her",,"Believe it or not,  Billie Eilish  is the happiest she's ever been, or at least that's what she's claiming on her latest studio album,  Happier Than Ever . But it's not your typical upbeat pop album — instead, it's more reflective and subdued. Through it all, it stays true to the young artist that took over pop music in only a few short years.    Over the years, Eilish has grown from an apprehensive adolescent to a remarkably assured global sensation. At only 19, she's performed for millions, collected multiple Grammy awards and undergone noticeable physical and mental transformations, conveniently documented by  Vanity Fair  in  their annual interviews with the singer .    But all the fame comes with its pitfalls — and Eilish finds peace in dealing with them, as tough as they may be. In opening track ""Getting Older,"" she plainly explores the pitfalls of fame: ""Things I once enjoyed / Just keep me employed now"" and ""I'm gettin' older / I've got more on my shoulders / But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong."" Other matters she discusses include dating as a celebrity, which she trolls about in the hair-raising track ""NDA"": ""Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? / No, had to save my money for security / Got a stalker walking up and down the street / Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet.""    Midway through the album, Eilish slows it all the way down with cathartic spoken word number ""Not My Responsibility,"" which first appeared in a short film during her live tour in 2020, kickstarting the major change in how she now presents herself. In the sombre, stripped-down track, she shares, ""If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman / If I shed the layers, I'm a slut / Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it and judge me for it / Why?"" The track acts as an ode of agency over her body, which has been a popular topic of discussion since Eilish entered the limelight. Another song where the singer discusses being oversexualized and taken advantage of is in the country-inspired ballad ""Your Power."" Uttering softly, "" I thought that I was special / You made me feel / Like it was my fault / You were the devil."" For some, this can be uncomfortable to hear, but ultimately her display of strength and vulnerability is her way of reclaiming happiness while offering solace to listeners facing similar issues.    Happiness may look and sound different for everyone. With Eilish, it can be confronting your trauma over a silky sensual beat or talking about secret rendezvouses on a Brazillian Bossa Nova track (the aptly titled ""Billie Bossa Nova""). Although she experiments with new genres on this album and shows more maturity in her lyrics, her sound for the most part doesn't change. On  Happier Than Ever , she's calmer compared to her eclectic 2019 debut,  When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? , but with the same angsty edge. She still embraces her youth and the process of self-discovery, which she explores in ""My Future"": ""'I'm in love with my future, can't wait to meet her / And I, I'm in love, but not with anybody else / Just wanna get to know myself."" If her future is anything like the song, it's bound to be interesting.

While mysterious British R&B act eschewed most publicity for  NINE , they at least detailed its 99-day availability  via Instagram , and followed that with  a post about the childhood trauma of the disenfranchised . They did even less than that for their 2019 albums  5  and  7 , and 2020 breakthroughs  Untitled (Black Is)  and  Untitled (Rise) , posting only cryptic photos and clips on Instagram. Once that earlier music was discovered by critics and listeners, it was widely praised, even though SAULT left the faintest of online footprints with it.    And while SAULT have yet to reveal its members' names, it's clear on  NINE  that those players have eclectic tastes and abilities. Over these 10 new tracks that amount to a mere 34 minutes, SAULT explores a multitude of genres, styles and moods. Closing track ""Light's in Your Hands"" is a spare ballad with a foot in gospel and the other in pop. ""Bitter Streets"" and ""Alcohol"" both build on the storied Soulquarians sound with a dash of Amy Winehouse's timeless cabaret flair, with the latter song also taking vocal cues from Erykah Badu.    Intoxicating as those back end tracks are, the album's earlier songs are less indebted to SAULT's influences. Take key track ""London Gangs"": its dark musical tone — snarling riffs, ruggedly ramshackle percussion, what sounds like a vocalist's imitation of a police siren — contrasts snugly with a vocalist's high pitched staccato verses, not to mention the climactic bridge where they hold on to notes for dear life. Then there's LP opener ""Haha,"" which instantly seizes attention with what sounds like hand drumming, along with a hookier-than-Velcro chanted chorus. While these numbers are more distinctive than tracks like ""Bitter Streets"" and ""Alcohol,"" they also are lower-fi, helping  NINE  span a spectrum between polish and grit.    The album's eclecticism is also best captured on ""Trap Life."" It begins with nothing more than skittering percussion propelling hypnotic chants, which is more than enough. Then, tough as that is to imagine, the song becomes even more compelling by taking a whiplash-inducing turn in its final quarter, including an electronica soundscape that wouldn't sound out of place on an MIA or  Little Simz  album (which makes sense, given that the latter's collaborator Inflo has been credited with production on all five SAULT records, and Simz herself contributes ever-reliably nimble rhymes on the breezy, sax-laden ""You From London"").    Powerful as all that is, the messages behind the music pack even more bruising punches. From the refrain of ""the pain is real"" on ""Fear,"" to the melancholy metaphor of gang life as a dysfunctional relationship on ""Bitter Streets,"" to the mistrust of the police described on ""Trap Life,"" the album brims with social consciousness about Black British life. And when the music and lyrics stop entirely for spoken word interludes about oppression and trauma-addled childhoods, listeners will be compelled to revisit those tracks as much as the album's catchiest songs.    Much like how, decades ago, Marvin Gaye used R&B to sing about ""what's going on,"" SAULT carry on commenting about those still-relevant issues with vivid lyrics about injustice wrapped in captivating rhythms.

There are obvious gestures to late 20th century technophobia and its obsession with economic collapse (""108 Y2K Voice""), but there are also apparent tributes to more contemporary uncanny valley virtual assistants (""Google Rap Hommage""), and ""New and Annoying"" suggests a progress hangover that feels endless — if computers have advanced to the point where they can do everything, why bother trying?    Fairfield and Provencher are looking to the past and going back to the future, this time inverting the subgenre's sampladelic complexity, jamming the songs out in the studio on drums and guitar before filling them out with drowsy DX7 swells, fretless bass, and vocals rendered nearly indecipherable by some unspoken machine, extracting samples from the results, and deploying them how they see fit — the final product leans more toward well-stewarded sessions that add up to an album than robotic, pointillist applications of found sounds.     There's a clear preference for instinctual programming over mathematical complexity, which also makes sense of the project's SEO-unfriendly name: even if Album's  Album  is just a collection of glitchy jazzbo flare-ups, Fairfield and Provencher are practically daring the algorithms to prove them wrong.  Album  sounds like it's making sense of a culture in generative limbo, radiating sound environments busied with gestures in every direction while simultaneously communicating a kind of stalemate, with tracks often terminating on a loose note that goes nowhere. Even when Fairfield's drum syncopations achieve a racing propulsion on ""165 Refrains,"" the push-and-pull tension effectively creates the musical equivalent of watching an overactive loading bar skip forward and backward while waiting for a software update.     The difference here is that a computer — or a sequencer, for that matter — replicating the timbral complexities of analogue instrumentation is still nearly impossible. Those devices can help those means achieve new sounds and so they shouldn't be abandoned, but they can't be allowed to become barriers to the latter's possible futures, either.

Balancing feeling and fun, BNL have managed to attract and sustain an intergenerational audience for over three decades.    So, now that ""It's All Been Done,"" what's next?    For several years now, the answer has been a resounding 'stay the course.' Since former songwriter and lead singer  Steven Page's departure in 2009  (and, arguably, for several years prior), the band has gotten used to putting out straight-ahead pop-rock albums every couple of years and touring incessantly.

This is why Barenaked Ladies' 16th studio album,  Detour de Force  — while taking some interesting thematic turns, and delivering some of the band's catchiest hooks in decades — reads as an unrealized opportunity to pivot, take some serious risks, and reclaim their title as one of Canada's most irresistibly unpredictable rock bands. When bandleader Ed Roberson sings ""Take another trip / See another side of the same ship"" on album opener and standout single ""Flip,"" it feels like he's describing the album's unrealized goal. This is a collection of songs that wink at what previously made this band great and hint at some interesting paths forward, but ultimately declare that BNL have simply become unrequired listening.    This isn't to say that  Detour de Force  fails to showcase anything new. The themes of this album are prescient: the proliferation of fake news, the perils of the climate crisis, and the desire for a safe home and a healthy family in our increasingly unlivable world. The perspectives on these themes vary considerably, ranging from the apocalyptic tone of ""New Disaster,"" which condemns the 24-hour news cycle and social media's impact on our mental health, to the tongue-in-cheek ""Flat Earth,"" relaying Robertson's unexpected encounter with a real-life flat-Earther.    However, the potency of these themes is distilled by the sheer length of the album, and often suffers when Robertson is not in the driver's seat. Though bassist Jim Creeggan's meanderings are always affable (epitomized by ""Paul Chambers,"" a jazzy ode to the legendary bassist that is both pleasant and instantly forgettable) and pianist Kevin Hearn's meditations usually provide some fresh air (the soundscape-y piano ballad ""The National Park"" does just that), these band members' greatest contributions are made through their instruments rather than their songwriting. Listening to their contributions often feels like watching clouds when what you'd really prefer is a bucket of water.    Though it is Robertson's writing that provides  Detour de Force  with several moments of wit and profundity, it seems that he's also comfortable showcasing fluff. Take the Shania Twain-tinged ""Roll Out,"" for instance, featuring the hook ""We're gonna kill it till the sun comes up."" Moments of sheer joy can be delightful, but there's always an opportunity to infuse some meaning into the nonsense. Earlier in the album, Roberson does this masterfully on ""Flip,"" twisting the kids' rhyme ""this is the church / this is the steeple"" into a commentary on a lack of nuance in our contemporary media landscape. Parading fun and nonsense while delivering an underlying message has always been a hallmark of BNL's music (read: ""One Week,"" ""Pinch Me,"" ""If I Had $1,000,000""), and though  Detour de Force  features this proclivity at a couple turns, it feels more like a nostalgia trip than a return to form.    For all of  Detour de Force 's enthusiasm and variety, it can't seem to shake the central issue of BNL's post-Page albums: a flattened sonic palette that just doesn't push boundaries the way it used to. One of the inceptual joys of Barenaked Ladies was the fact that their biggest radio hits sounded like nothing else in the zeitgeist (""One Week,"" ""Pinch Me,"" ""If I Had $1,000,000""). Now, this quartet seems amiable to bending their sound towards flavourless pop-rock production trends (as the car commercial-ready chorus of ""Good Life"" attests), rather than allowing it to stand on its own merits.    The moments in which Barenaked Ladies do, to their credit, try to push their sound and substance in new directions provide mixed results. Though the album's final track, ""Internal Dynamo,"" brings in trumpeter Michael Ray (of the Sun Ra Arkestra), this interesting collaboration does nothing to rescue this track, which squeezes a  School of Rock -esque breakdown between robotic, new age-y meanderings.    On the other side of the coin,  Detour de Force 's understated highlight is ""Man Made Lake,"" a tender reflection on humans' influence in shaping the natural world that was co-written by Robertson and  Donovan Woods  (and also featured on Woods' 2020 album  Without People ). Such a thoughtful collaboration with an emerging voice in Canadian folk music offers some hope. More collaborations like this could steer the band out of the habits they've fallen into, and perhaps allow them to truly ""see another side of the same ship.""    For the time being, 'steady as she goes.'

Named after the British forest where the Canadian musician spent much of the pandemic, it begins with staccato bursts that build into a dancefloor Morse code, spelling out nothing less than a good time. There's the sizzling riff and unhurried percussion that open ""Wilner's Parade,"" along with the transistor-on-the-fritz first half of ""Almost Victory (Keep End Going)."" Both showcase Drew's penchant for offbeat rhythms and otherworldly sonics. They also prove just how far a seemingly simple beatmaking app — the aptly named Endlesss — can be pushed.     Another highlight, ""You and Me and Them,"" begins with droning notes that, like a July sunshower's first drops, shimmer before gently landing. A number of intricate textures bloom and fade by the track's end, from slapping percussion and oscillating hums to assuredly dramatic chimes. ""Dooms Dive,"" meanwhile, begins with a darker tone driven by a clanging refrain that is overtaken mid-way by a mellower echoing pulse, which then gives way to sunny chirps. And ""Shadow Rescues"" starts with a percolating riff that becomes entangled with both a popped bubble wrap percussion loop and a haunted groan that grows sharper as it lingers on, before suddenly ceasing. All of that occurs within, impressively enough, the song's first minute.     Though not as accessible or anthemic fellow aughts indie rocker Dan Boeckner's electronica explorations with current outfit Operators, nor poised to have Drew overtake Caribou at the forefront of Canadian avant-garde electronica,  Influences  nevertheless rewards repeated listens precisely because of its slow burn subtlety. And if an early '80s auteur needed to soundtrack their endearingly nuanced sci-fi flick,  Influences  would certainly fit the bill. Regardless, Drew will make you pine for such impossibilities with the open-hearted hopeful tones and unpredictable rhythmic twists he wrings out of that DIY app for this promising solo album. Just imagine what he could pull off with a more elaborate electronica setup.

2021-07-13,Wesley McLean,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Vince Staples' Newfound Wisdom Hits Hard on Minimalist Self-Titled Album,,"Since he first stepped onto the scene,  Vince Staples ' music has been characterized by its abrasive and uncompromising aspects. Whether the jarring stylistic choices of 2017's   Big Fish Theory  or the bleak lyrical content of most of his discography, he's always been an artist whose edge is an integral part of his charm. With  Vince Staples , his new self-titled album, the Long Beach rapper has softened that edge, opting to pair stripped-back instrumentals with a more conversational cadence and a newfound knack for melodies, resulting in his most personable and accessible release to date.    That's not to say that Staples' music has ever lacked personality or transparency — even on his earliest mixtapes, the 28-year-old rapper's music detailed the troubling tales of death and disorder that characterized his adolescence — but his perspective appears to have changed as he's matured. It feels like Staples has grown exponentially since we heard him last, becoming wiser with time and seemingly finding some semblance of peace of mind despite his past.    His observations on life, his experiences and his environment are less visceral than they've been on previous projects, feeling more like introspective reflections than they do vivid descriptions of his current life. It's the perspective of a man who is far enough removed from his past to look at it through a different lens, gaining new insight and coming to terms with the things that he has experienced.    It's this newfound perspective that makes the music that much more intimate. It's a feeling that's accentuated by Staples' excellent songwriting and newfound willingness to explore softer vocal deliveries. Staples' flow is silky smooth throughout the entirety of this LP, seamlessly transitioning from catchy hooks to verses where he effortlessly strings his syllables together, all over a collection of airy, atmospheric instrumentals provided by frequent collaborator  Kenny Beats .    It's clear that Staples and Kenny Beats — who'd previously produced the entirety of Staples' 2018 album  FM!  — have come together with a concise vision for this release.  Vince Staples  is the rapper's most personal and emotionally resonant project yet, and the choice to opt for a stripped-back approach complements the content greatly. Vince's blunt and bleak observations on life, death, humanity, gang culture, paranoia and trauma fit perfectly with the sparse and skeletal soundscape of this LP. It feels like every instrumental here was crafted to give his words the room they need to have the impact they're meant to.    These instrumentals giving room to Staples' words pays off majorly, and it's the reason that this album has such immense depth despite its very short, 22-minute length. Every observation that Staples shares here — whether it be exploring how fame has affected his paranoia on ""SUNDOWN TOWN"" or his ""TAKE ME HOME"" revelation that he drives around with the music loud because ""when it's quiet out, I hear the sounds of those who rest in peace"" — is made all the more harrowing by the minimalistic production, allowing his words to linger a little longer and hit a little harder.    At its brief length,  Vince Staples  might seem like it's going to underwhelm, but it does quite the opposite. Staples and Kenny Beats' pared-down approach to this album is what makes it so incredibly endearing. The relatively sparse production serves as the perfect foundation for Staples' lyrics, highlighting his abilities as a rapper while also perfectly scoring his incredibly gripping storytelling. It's clear that Kenny Beats understands Staples' vision and what makes him such a captivating rapper, and their great chemistry is what makes  Vince Staples  such a captivating record.

2021-07-14,Bryon Hayes,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",New Chance Weaves Existential Meditations into Dancefloor Hits on 'Real Time',,"Victoria Cheong continues to mature as a producer, lyricist and vocalist. As  New Chance , she continues to draw inspiration from '80s and '90s electronic and dancehall sounds, but has recently widened her net to include motifs common across experimental electronic composition. This isn't to say that her music has become clinical — quite the opposite. With  Real Time , Cheong playfully incorporates outré tones, field recordings and evocative syncopations within her sensual blend of time-dilating dance music.    Thematically,  Real Time  draws inspiration from Cheong's grandfather, a bonsai enthusiast and photographer. His photos of a nocturnally flowering cactus grace the album's cover, and the lyrics hint at the cycles inherent in both the natural and human worlds. Her grandfather immigrated from China when he was thirteen, so the opening track ""Eye of the Storm,"" which contemplates what it means to belong, surely echoes the thoughts of a young teen experiencing a new country and culture for the first time. The track's loping beat and multi-tracked synths are the perfect backdrop for Cheong's soft sung-spoken vocal delivery.    The more forceful ""Earth House (Turning),"" with its house-inspired piano stabs and deep bass throb, is a hymn to Mother Earth, describing how our bodies will eventually become one with the soil and reminding us that this cycle will continue endlessly. Life begets death begets life ad infinitum. This existential introspection couched in a dancefloor-ready rhythm showcases just how much Cheong has grown as a songwriter over the course of her career. Not many artists situate their beats within a philosophical underpinning, and she has a knack for doing it with grace.    On ""Fallen,"" Cheong strips the musical elements back to a barely-there synth melody. The cacophony of daily life takes over: birds chirp, a rooster crows, people call out, and a dog howls. Over the thick din of existence, she sweetly sings of having been in both placid and exciting environments, before repeating, ""Don't you cry for me / just because I'm fallen."" She's yearning for a past that she's moved on from, or maybe she's just happily reminiscing. Cheong leaves it up to the listener to come to their own conclusion.    Throughout  Real Time , Cheong moves between being ready to hit the club and wanting to stay home and meditate on what it means to be alive. Somehow, she makes these two modes interchangeable, such that the tracks flow into each other almost seamlessly. Her utterly gorgeous-sounding voice is the encapsulating element that elevates the experience into something beautiful to behold. The music is slick, the lyrics are deep, but that voice: it's pure bliss.

2021-07-16,Kaelen Bell,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Clairo Leaves Her Bedroom for the Great Beyond on 'Sling',,"If those sharing  Clairo 's understated viral hit ""Pretty Girl"" in 2017 could time travel to our heat-warped present, it's entirely possible they wouldn't recognize Claire Cottrill at all. They'd certainly be surprised by  Sling , the 22-year-old's vibrant and unexpected second record. A masterclass in rendering your early output obsolete and a lesson in taking yourself seriously when others won't,  Sling  is Clairo fully realized, a record that finally abandons the bedroom for the hills.    Last year, Cottrill posted a shaky, delicate  rendition of Carole King's timeless ""You've Got a Friend.""  While it's not exactly a left-field choice, the cover, along with her takes on  Johnny Flynn's ""Brown Trout Blues""  and  Anna Domino's ""Everyday, I Don't,""  hinted at a facet of Cottrill's songwriting voice that hadn't been fully explored on the vaporous indie pop of 2019's  Immunity .     Sling  is the garden promised by those seeds, a carefully orchestrated and patiently rendered collection of songs that recasts Cottrill's music in the visage of artists like King and James Taylor. Co-produced with the inescapable  Jack Antonoff  at Allaire Studios in Upstate New York,  Sling  is coloured by dappled sunlight and long amber shadows, breathing and shifting in ways her music never has previously. The acoustic lilt of first single ""Blouse"" was something of a red herring, as the majority of tracks here swirl with strings, Mellotron, bouncing basslines, horns, woodwinds and coppery guitar.    There's nothing quite as immediate as  Immunity 's instant-classic ""Bags,"" though the driving guitar pop of ""Zinnias"" comes close. And the feather-lite funk of ""Amoeba"" would be a contender were it not for its oddly stiff drumbeat, an unwelcome holdover from Cottrill's debut that dominates the patchwork of guitar and keyboard wiggling beneath.    There are a few small moments like this — the soupy, wedding-quartet strings that weigh down ""Blouse,"" for instance — where the production nearly gets in the way of Cottrill's tender, searching songwriting. It's an issue that's appeared on other Antonoff-produced records, when the producer's talents are expected to shift from bombastic pop to quiet, folky intimacy; there's an alien disconnect at times, like listening to someone describe warmth rather than feeling it yourself.    The slip-ups are few and far between, however, and more often than not the record is a showcase of Cottrill's immense growth as a songwriter and arranger. Songs like ""Bambi,"" ""Partridge,"" ""Wade"" and joyful instrumental ""Joanie"" move in patient, elliptical suites, eschewing traditional pop structures for something organic and serpentine. Her lyrical pursuits are new, too: syllable-dense cascades that explore themes of family and caregiving, isolation and growing up, and the kind of love that rewires your brain. It's a domestic record in the truest sense, one that creaks along floorboards and leans out the windows — the sounds of building a life.    Claire Cottrill may not have had a difficult time finding her way into the music industry, but she's still often felt like an artist with something to prove. And after years spent developing in the public eye,  Sling  feels like an arrival — it's the clearest distillation of Clairo's voice yet, a record both about and born of self-discovery .

2021-07-19,Anthony Boire,9,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Darkside's 'Spiral' Mourns the End of the World — and Celebrates What We Still Have Left,,"A funny thing happened on the way to  Darkside 's return from hiatus. After all,  Nicolas Jaar  and  Dave Harrington  announced that the band was  ""coming to an end, for now""  back in April 2014, less than a year after their breakout LP, 2013's  Psychic . Seven years and countless global calamities later, the duo return with the record no one expected them to make — a warm, woodsy and acoustic-tinged odyssey about the end of the world. If  Psychic  was the sweaty come-down from electronic rock's moment back in the early 2010s,  Spiral  is a soothing balm to nourish and recalibrate all the trauma since the last party ended. More simply, it's a campfire jam session for the apocalypse.    With six of the nine tracks written in 2018, it's unbelievable how well this record flows and holds together — and that's without even mentioning how prophetic the tracks have proven to be over the last three years. Written from a small house in Leni Lenape territory (present-day Flemington, NJ), many of its songs hint at authorities ignoring (or causing) the world's imminent climate change disaster — like on the single  ""Lawmaker,""  where Jaar croons bitterly, ""Winners have their fun while their kin have their back / 'You're making no sense' said the man before it all turned to black.""    Other tracks, like heavy opener ""Narrow Road"" and the psychedelic-tinged ""I'm the Echo,"" call back to the darker flavours of Darkside's previous work, but with added notes of Gregorian chanting and fluid, rubbery guitar playing in Eastern modes. Different global influences add to this swan song for our natural world.    While eulogizing what we have lost,  Spiral  finds Jaar and Harrington (and likely a few session musicians from the New York scene) celebrating what we still have. The album is groovy, yes, but it's also drenched in sounds from the natural world. Hints of bird song, a live drum kit, insects buzzing and softly strummed acoustic guitars all lend a warm touch to the bittersweet themes.    At a time when seemingly every artist is creating work about the horror of being trapped indoors, Darkside want to change the conversation. On the slow-burn climax of the record, ""Inside Is Out There,"" a fragile groove slowly swells with twinkling synths and melodies, until a heartbreaking but short vocal performance glides over everything, sending the song into a cosmic coda. Human tension builds and builds, but the only relief, if the record is to be believed, is to enjoy what is ""out there."" We're not meant to stew in our own anxieties, boxed in by four walls indefinitely. Darkside don't want to dwell on these dark times until we lose ourselves completely; they're grateful, refreshed and awake to the reality out there.  Spiral  is the album tentatively, patiently inviting us back into the natural world we come from — where we are still needed.

2021-07-15,Jordan Currie,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Willow Smith Makes Pop-Punk Her Own on 'lately i feel EVERYTHING',,"Willow Smith  didn't think she was capable of singing rock music. Her pivot from dreamy pop and R&B to angsty punk rock was a surprise to her fans, but was nearly universally embraced when her earworm of a single "" ​t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l"" dropped a few months ago. Her affinity for the pop-punk acts of the early aughts such as My Chemical Romance, Paramore and Avril Lavigne, as well as her mother Jada Pinkett Smith (the former frontwoman for nu-metal band Wicked Wisdom), paved the way for her to follow down the rock path. But as she's described in  a recent  Rolling Stone  interview , ""When I first started doing my own music and my parents got me a vocal coach, we only did pop and R&B kind of vibes, and so for my entire life, I didn't think I had the voice to sing this kind of music or sing rock in general."" Her fourth studio album,  lately i feel EVERYTHING , proves her doubts wrong — Willow's new pop-rock sound, drenched in early 2000s nostalgia, finds her sounding right at home.    The enigmatic, spiritual songs of Willow's 2015 debut album  Ardipithecus   garnered mixed reviews, but the album showcased her abilities beyond the ""Whip My Hair"" one-hit wonder child of Will and Jada, and as someone who was beginning to carve out her artistic vision. She would continue to expand her spacey sound further on  The 1st  (2017) and  Willow  (2019), of which the latter found Willow dropping all existential dread and instead letting loose on an expression of freedom and a celebration of breaking out of toxic friendships and relationships.      lately i feel EVERYTHING  lead single "" ​t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l,"" featuring  Travis Barker , continues this liberated energy right off the bat for a track about ditching fake friends that would fit perfectly on Paramore's  Brand New Eyes . Barker lends his drumming talents to other tracks including ""Gasoline,"" a bright, punchy anthem that has ""anime opening theme song"" written all over it, and ""G R O W,"" which also features vocals from the pop-punk princess herself,  Avril Lavigne . Hearing Lavigne and Willow harmonize over clapping rhythms and jubilant guitar chords recalls the former's 2007 album,  The Best Damn Thing .    Willow's eccentric vocals and borderline cartoonish enunciation of words fits the theatricality of emo and pop-punk genre. She cohesively slides between hitting sky-high notes and low roars within the same tracks, like on ""don't SAVE ME,"" which has a dark drop that satisfyingly crashes hard to the ground. ""Lipstick,"" the second single, is a smoky and animalistic metal track that puts Willow's soaring vocals front and center. Meanwhile, rap-rocker ""XTRA,"" featuring  Tierra Whack , is effortlessly nonchalant while remaining full of buoyancy.    A longer runtime could have benefitted the record. Most tracks are criminally brief which fits into the punk ethos, but often finds the songs ending just as they reach their climax or take an interesting turn. This is especially true on the  Cherry Glazerr -featuring closer ""¡BREAKOUT!,"" which packs a riot grrrl punch, but sidesteps its full potential to be an epic curtain call after only two minutes.    It's inevitable that  lately i feel EVERYTHING  will be relentlessly compared to its influences and predecessors, but Willow manages to pay homage to the subculture while putting her own spin on it. Even with rock influences being interwoven into the music of her contemporaries such as fellow Lavigne and Paramore disciple Olivia Rodrigo, Willow leans all the way into the authenticity of the sound and stands out as a result.

2021-07-19,Wesley McLean,6,"POP AND ROCK,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM","John Mayer Tries Something New, Kinda, on 'Sob Rock'",,"Throughout his 20-plus years in the music industry,  John Mayer  has managed to explore a diverse array of sounds to varying degrees of success, never committing to a single style or putting the same album out twice. It's an admirable feat, but it's always come with a catch — no matter which style or genre Mayer is emulating, he seldom leaves his comfort zone. His penchant for pairing charming, relatable, pop-leaning songwriting with highly skilled but mostly subdued guitar work is present in every release and is slowly becoming more of a crutch than a solid foundation for his music.    That's not to say that his explorations of different genres don't work, but they work much better when the albums have a specific vision or direction. His magnum opus, 2006's  Continuum , saw him embracing his blues, jazz and soul influences, and it resulted in his best work to date. With 2012's  Born and Raised , Mayer delved deeply into Americana, trying his hand at the traditions of alt-country and folk-rock and delivering an underrated and incredibly enjoyable effort.     Sob Rock 's artwork makes it immediately apparent what's in store once you press play — a tongue-in-cheek project that harkens back to the sounds and styles of the '80s, capturing the decade's musical aesthetic but delivering it in a somewhat jocular manner. For the most part, the album does just that, housing songs that fit right into any dad rock station's daily rotation without being too derivative or too humorous to be taken seriously. It's a perfectly pleasant and easygoing listening experience — so much so that it eventually becomes a detriment to the album.    Mayer has once again made himself at home in a genre that he's not accustomed to, but has done so by burrowing himself into a bed a familiarity at the heart of it. Sure, he's executing the '80s soft rock aesthetic to the high degree that you would expect of a musician of his calibre, but he never exceeds that expectation, comfortably playing it safe for the majority of the LP. It's disappointing because, for all of this album's enjoyability, it never has that ""wow"" moment or exceptional song, barring the hilariously bad ""Why You No Love Me,"" which stands out for all of the wrong reasons.    Despite its shortcomings,  Sob Rock  still manages to remain breezy for the entirety of its short runtime. There's an undeniable warmth to the way Mayer's voice sails across a sea of plucky guitar strings on the Dire Straits-influenced ""Wild Blue,"" which features some of the best guitar work on the album. Closer ""All I Want Is to Be With You"" finds Mayer playing himself out in dramatic fashion with an anthemic, bluesy guitar solo.    Moments like these prove that, despite the downside that comes with Mayer treading those familiar waters,  Sob Rock  is probably his best since  Born and Raised . With a cohesive, '80s-inspired soundscape and some earnest, heartfelt songwriting, Mayer has created an album that is an almost consistently enjoyable listen. It may not live up to the efforts of its influences, but  Sob Rock  is perfect for a carefree summertime drive along the coast.

Recorded in 2002, vocalist Milo Aukerman and drummer Bill Stevenson brought back guitarist Frank Navetta and bassist Tony Lombardo to record an entire album based on songs written before the release of their immortal 1982 debut,  Milo Goes to College . With Navetta's passing in 2008, the band halted their years-long sessions, leaving most of the tracks unfinished before Aukerman added the final vocals to these 18 tracks in 2020.    But what makes Descendents' eighth full-length so fascinating is the fact that these songs contain such a variety of ideas and moods for something that was originally written by a bunch of teenagers. ""You Make Me Sick"" is written like an angry hardcore song, before Aukerman delivers an eye-winking vomiting noise at the end, while ""I'm Shaky"" features honest-to-goodness harmonies, and their sped-up cover of Dave Clark Five's 1963 smash ""Glad All Over"" shows off each band member's love of vintage pop music.    The fact that the majority of the material was written 40 years back and recorded nearly two decades ago leaves the onus strictly on Aukerman to keep these numbers sounding youthful and full of punk vigor. Tracks like the thrashy 60-second ""Crepe Suzette"" and the remarkably melodic ""Yore Disgusting"" find him pushing his voice to its breaking point, as he crackles along with Lombardo's skittering basslines. He even manages to bring the valley-boy spirit to ""It's a Hectic World"" and ""Ride the Wild,"" respectively the A-side and B-side of Descendents' first single, originally recorded before he was a member of the band.    Luckily, the 25-minute LP contains enough spitfire energy and ire to match the band's early records. Navetta shows great range on the remarkably hefty ""Lullaby"" and delivers metal-style riffing of ""Tired of Being Tired."" Stevenson — the most tenured musician on this album, having played consistently for 40 years as a member of Black Flag, All and Descendents — is the real glue that hold this record together. The drummer keeps Lombardo's chewy basslines on track, best demonstrated on the two-and-a-half-minute anthem ""Nightage"" and the swinging ""Grudge."" While  9th & Walnut  ranks among Descendents' best work, circumstances have made it more of a capsule in time than a harbinger of future classics from the band.

De Doorn  effectively purges the pain that defined Amenra's past six albums in their  Mass  series. Indeed, the translated lyrics of single ""De Evenmens"" frame the journey toward death as the inevitable freeing of the spirit: ""Fare thee well / My dying body / My dying heart / The days, they depart."" Even though these songs originated from impromptu ""fire rituals"" Amenra observed during the past three years, ""De Evenmens'' counterbalances glacial viscera with groovier, even hookier arrangements.    Hummable riffs notwithstanding, Amenra's commitment to obscurity hasn't diminished.  De Doorn  is the band's first to feature lyrics entirely in Dutch. Though indecipherable to most people outside of the Netherlands, the vocals transcend language barriers by harnessing transcendental spiritual energy.    Opening cut ""Ogentroost"" reestablishes Amenra's blend heavy music and religious ecstasy, cutting expertly-built tension with deafening dynamic shifts. Almost half of the song comprises cavernous ambient drones and spoken word, meticulously unveiling the song's ominous riff before the whole band drops like an exploding depth charge. Colin H. van Eeckhout's piercing screams and the massive yet nuanced riffs of Mathieu J. Vandekerckhove and Lennart Bossu remain as resonant as ever, but the guest vocals from Oathbreaker's Caro Tanghe become the real show stopper.    A fellow member of the Church of Ra, Tanghe sounds right at home as she augments  De Doorn 's atmosphere and melodies with a third vocal approach to round off the screams and speaking. She and Eeckhout trade poetic stanzas over the dreary, foreboding and remarkably transfixing ambient piece ""De Dood In Bloei,"" but the former's influence seems to empower the latter to explore his own melodic facets. Though Amenra still revel in soothing listeners with whispery soundscapes before smashing them with thundering dirges,  De Doorn  offers much more wiggle room between the two extremes.    The final moments of ""Het Gloren"" feature a classic Amenra quiet-to-loud jump scare, but the track displays many shades of grey to smooth out stark contrasts. Gradually manifesting a guitar motif this might seem like post-metal 101, but Amenra deal their densely harmonic soundscape like a hand of cards. Even if switch-ups amount to inconspicuous vocal inflections or chord changes, Amenra intensify their impact by letting the tempo ebb and flow ever so slightly during each passage. The band's respect for minutia and taste as well as scope helps closer ""Voor Immer"" reach an unprecedented payoff after its eight-minute intro.    The song's clean guitar chords loop like an Om chant, guided by stoic spoken word into a sound bath of vocal drones and dancing arpeggios. It's hardly patience-testing, as the long-winded crescendo acts like a camera slowly panning out over a vista of harmonic, pulsing hypnosis. The album's finale acts as an emphatic step onto a precipice of levelling distortion, rather than a jarring juxtaposition. It's a true masterclass of ambient doom from one of the best bands to do it.    Whether they dropkick souls into oblivion or gently open third eyes, these guys have honed their foundations and expanded their horizons.  De Doorn  is not only a continuation, but also a rebirth of Amenra's pilgrimage of apocalyptic heaviness.

2021-06-24,Rosemary Akpan,9,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Doja Cat Shows Off a World of Range on 'Planet Her',,"Doja Cat  is in a league — or, in this case, on a planet — of her own. If it wasn't already obvious after the acclaim she's received from her sophomore album,  Hot Pink , or by the protracted success of viral hit  ""Say So,""  then it definitely will be once you listen to her third studio album,  Planet Her .     The space-themed album consists of 14 songs that highlight Doja's versatility. Opening track ""Woman"" frolics with a reggae-fused sound different from what she's usually known or recognized for. Yet, in typical Doja fashion, she's still able to deliver her usual quick-witted bars, complemented by a catchy chorus.     On songs like the Young Thug-featuring ""Payday"" and Ariana Grande-featuring ""I Don't Do Drugs,"" Doja channels early-'00s nostalgia but with plenty of modern innovation — her sound familiar, yet fresh at the same time. Another standout track is ""Ain't Shit,"" which  may  or  may not  be about Nas (who  dissed her in last year's ""Ultra Black,""  after ""Ain't Shit"" had been teased under its former title ""N.A.S.""): ""N****s ain't shit, come up in your crib / All up in your fridge, can't pay rent / Look at what you did, listen to your friends / When they say n****s ain't shit.""     There are a lot of references to love, relationships and sex on this album. Although Doja is private on matters surrounding her personal life, she lets listeners in on songs like ""Been Like This,"" ""Alone"" and ""Love to Dream,"" where she admits, ""I got everything / Everything but real love."" These and other moments showcase a different, more vulnerable side to the rapper compared to her typical over-the-top eccentricities.     Planet Her  has no skips, not even the previously released singles. It showcases many sides to Doja but remains cohesive — if you don't consume it in its entirety, you'll definitely miss out on truly understanding her world.

2021-06-24,Anthony Boire,6,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Modest Mouse Play Against Their Strengths on 'The Golden Casket',,"Singer-guitarist Isaac Brock has long run a unique tightrope act in the singular little sphere of indie rock that  Modest Mouse  have carved out. His vocals can take on a sharp yelp (""Do the Cockroach""), and at other times are delivered through gnashed teeth (""Lampshades on Fire""), but he also can croon with a quasi-country affectation when the song calls for it (""Float On""). Performances always balance ferocity and intimacy. But in 2021, how much demand is there for the barks and whispers of turn-of-the-millennium guitar music? Modest Mouse tiptoe the line between channelling noxious masculine tropes and satirizing them with biting irony. Their best efforts use rage to reflect inward with brutal honesty. Profound, devastating sadness is often masked in their loudest moments. Six years after the excellent  Strangers to Ourselves , Modest Mouse return with an album that varies so wildly in performance, arrangements and quality that one wonders whether these songs were meant to form an emotionally cohesive whole at any point.     The Golden Casket  is uneven, as Brock and the band seem to hide from their most dangerous impulses. Despite  wanting to create more hopeful, inspiring music , Brock can't help but pen dour dystopian songs like ""Wooden Soldiers"" then pair them with plunky, child-friendly tunes like ""The Sun Hasn't Left Yet,"" possibly the worst song in the band's catalogue. Modest Mouse are familiar with quieter moments, but there's far too much going on here — as if  The Moon & Antarctica  would've sounded better with strings, choir vocals, orchestral percussion and xylophones all crashing together? Unlike some of the other intriguing experiments here, the chipper ""The Sun Hasn't Left Yet,"" sounds over-baked and bored with its tired copy-paste structure. This song has ""modern rock radio single"" written all over from the moment Isaac Brock churns out its empty chorus: ""I don't know you / You don't know me.""    Things get back on track with the fiery ""Never Fuck a Spider on a Fly,"" where absolutely everything buzzes and crackles. Brock has always known how to spit a curse word to achieve maximum potency, and it works here. There's that masculinity tightrope walking again.    These more menacing elements of Modest Mouse remain at the forefront until the masterful final track, ""Back to the Middle."" It sounds so different from every other song on  Casket , an album that already has a noticeable cohesion problem, that it begs the question whether it was even written or recorded in the same timeframe as the other pieces. Pairing bestial instrumentals with Brock's most fragile and introspective performance so far, it all comes together here. He's bruised, raw, and carries with him the same Midwest and blue-collar machismo that poisons so many relationships, but he knows it and wants to work on it. ""Back to the Middle"" can't save this album, but it comes close. Perhaps it may point to Modest Mouse's future, and to a more stripped-back sound that suits them better.

2021-06-24,Chris Bryson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,EP,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Winnipeg's Caid Jones Embarks on a Triumphant Journey with 'No Distractions Please',,"Caid Jones  is one of Winnipeg's rising young rappers, so it probably surprised some when, before his debut EP  No Distractions Please  had even come out, he revealed that while his creative passions are true, he doesn't aspire to the life of a musician. To him it's an art form with utility: a way to express, connect, and support himself and his family and communities.    This kind of honesty pervades  No Distractions Please , and even though Jones is still early in his career, he's been dedicated to honing his craft. The Cree-Irish rapper cut his teeth at Winnipeg's Studio 393, a hip hop-based program for youth and young adults where he got to learn from experienced talents like Nestor Wynrush, Pip Skid (formerly of Farm Fresh) and Charlie Fettah (formerly of Winnipeg's Most). He's also opened for artists like Swollen Members, Skratch Bastid and Brother Ali, and cofounded  Pay Attention , a Winnipeg brand and label focused on hip-hop and R&B, and focused on fostering communities and raising awareness about important issues.    While Jones' personal storytelling touches on a variety of subjects, the most prominent come from his vulnerabilities, insights, and hard looks at Manitoba's (and Canada's) racism and continuing dark realities. He delivers these things with remarkable flair, confidence and palpable intensity — but, more than anything,  No Distractions Please  is meant to inspire and uplift. Jones is driven by a focused vision with a fierce flow and vocal versatility, and he puts his skills on full display.    Instrumentally,  No Distractions Please  pays homage to a variety of hip-hop influences, and even includes a strange skit about a Humpty Dumpty conspiracy that leads into the looped strings and bounding energy of ""No Distractions."" With a constant barrage of heavy beats, there's a progression throughout the EP that almost mirrors Jones' confessions and revelations, and as he opens up, ominous atmospherics evolve into exultance. And while the elements used are nothing new for hip-hop, they're presented in ways that provide a rousing backdrop to the rapper's fiery verses and dips into soulful croon.    On intro ""Higher,"" warped, gloomy figures weave around deep bass and skittering percussion. Jones' lines are remarkably sharp with striking agility in his delivery, like when he kicks into a higher gear at the three-minute mark and rides a onslaught of words to the finish line. Clarity and awareness come through the eerie twinkling, booming bass and clattering beats of ""Stay Woke."" And in the groovy ""Butterfly"" he finds perspective on what's important with billowing horns, groaning tones and tinkling keys. ""Frozen"" features news snippets about Manitoba's nation-leading homicide rates with grim disparities regarding Indigenous peoples and the need for social intervention. Over forceful beats and pulsing synth, Jones raps about staying hopeful and purposeful despite oppressions, and at 21 speaks of the hard reality that ""if you want some change, you've got to suffer through.""    Jones' earnestness, in tandem with his ambitiously open heart and desire to help and bring about change, gives  No Distractions Please  a vital energy. He could turn heads with the speed and force of his flow alone, but he couples it with carefully considered lyrics that provide glimpses into his impassioned and honest life. Jubilant EP closer ""Could Heaven Sound Like This?"" finds Jones backed by gospel vocals as he lays out his intent with words declaring worth in all people: ""Hoping for elevation / I know the devil's lazy / I'll be there waiting counting time as I'm meditating / I know sometimes I'm out of line / But I'll demonstrate that lives come in straight from the divine / Even though it's hard to find."" It's when he hits the first line that the backing vocals come in for the final time to help lead the song out, and Jones' journey feels triumphant. Here's hoping there's many more to come.

2021-06-25,Tom Beedham,7,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,R&B,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",I M U R's Pop Hedonism Has Depth on 'My Molecules',,"On  My Molecules ,  I M U R  singer Jenny Lea often sound like she's given up. The songs are full of Lea's stories of co-dependency and self-medicating, all delivered through the enabling vernacular of pop hedonism (boozing, blazing, fucking) — but the group resist romanticizing the excess they're describing.    Even when recalling trips around the world that end in marathon booty calls with a partner on ""Himme Right,"" the luxed-up sexcapades are rendered as empty endeavours, scenes of physical intimacy articulated in terms of wage labour exploitation while producers Mikey J Blige and Amine Bouzaher summon a heaving bass beat that repeats like the nagging reminder of whatever work engagement will tear the couple apart next: ""You've been working overtime like all night,"" she sings, ""12 hours of head / Eight weeks in bed.""    On ""Case of You,"" Lea describes a relationship she feels more instinctually than she does on any deep emotional level, a dynamic compared to guzzling weekend warrior boilermakers while interpolating Joni Mitchell: ""I could drink a case of you / I don't need no chase with you / I just love the taste of you."" The metaphor for substance abuse is apt; Lea isn't living these interactions so much as metabolizing them to fill time and cancel herself out. And the multi-entendres are weary if compelling wordplay that pack bummers like nesting dolls.    Pop's now-ubiquitous trap snares trickle throughout the album, establishing the production within well-trodden territory, but Blige and Bouzaher decorate the rhythms with gloomy chords and sad music box twinkling, evoking a lifestyle more mundane and barren than the kinetic hustling the sound is typically associated with. On the opening title track, sci-fi vocals get at the truth of what's wrong with so much of the behaviour described throughout the album, but it's heavily modulated and sounds like it's being held under water: ""Normalcy is my only complex / I crossed the seas to fight / You said I was brave / When I ran away.""    It isn't until the back end of the album that Lea starts to get a clearer picture, and she acknowledges a wider circle here. On ""Sad Girls Club,"" Lea's vocals layer to harmonize with each other as she describes finding sobriety, and she gives the exchange rate of her transactional relationships (""I give, you take"") a name on ""Bad Love,"" ""Spent"" (""All that glitters is not gold"") and ""Worst Behavior,"" enlisting the help of rapper Mauvey to drop some tough love group therapy on the latter: ""We need referees, plural, to end our fights.""    By album closer ""Gravity,"" Lea hasn't shaken off everything that's been weighing her down and she still acknowledges an escapist pull, but there's a clarity and an intention to Lea's flow as she sings ""I wanna forget my problems / Ain't it a bitch gotta solve em"" over cloudy atmospheres and chiming guitars. When she declares, ""I'm in a rocket ship up to outer space,"" you get the sense she doesn't feel the barriers to her recovery in the same way, the liquid state she was drowning in turned to gas.    When you look deep enough into its void,  My Molecules  is less about acknowledging one's true nature than it is about discovering a capacity for change — for something new, for something more.

Team's 'Get Up Sequences Part One' Is a Reminder That Twee Indie Kids Need Pump-Up Jams Too,,"Twee indie folks enjoy sports too, and that's always been  the Go! Team 's niche, since their music sounds like  Jock Jams  for Belle and Sebastian fans. Imagine ""Whoomp! (There It Is)"" played on glockenspiel and you'd have a pretty good idea of the territory they've been exploring for close to 20 years, since 2004's still-brilliant  Thunder, Lightning, Strike .     Get Up Sequences Part One  often feels like a time capsule from the band's earlier days. The sound is a lot more hi-fi, and there's a bit more shoegaze and hip-hop this time around, but the general blueprint is the same.    Album opener ""Let the Seasons Work"" sounds a bit like all of  Thunder, Lightning, Strike  rolled into one, with rousing horns that give way to cute faux-flute riffs and girl-group pop melodies. ""Pow"" has the Go! Team's signature style of chanted vocals that fall halfway between rapping and schoolyard shouts, while the wheezing harmonica on ""A Memo for Maceo"" sounds like a direct allusion to early-career highlight ""Panther Dash."" During the making of the album, bandleader Ian Parton's hearing was seriously compromised due to an ear condition called Meniere's disease — but even though he describes the experience as ""traumatic"" in a press release, the palpable sense of joy across these 10 tracks never wavers.    The Go! Team stretch their wings slightly on ""Cookie Scene,"" which puts a twee twist on flute-driven rap thanks to guest verses from Indigo Yaj and an aggressively cheerful beat. Elsewhere, the Go! Team skew very slightly darker than usual: prior to the aforementioned harmonica, ""A Memo for Maceo"" begins with a woozy intro straight out of MBV's  Loveless , and this shoegaze influence reemerges with the seasick churn of ""Freedom Now."" The juxtaposition of giddy bubblegum and squalling guitar noise makes ""I Loved You Better"" sound like a less harsh version of Sleigh Bells.    Subtitling this album  Part One  feels a bit self-deprecating — as if it can't stand on its own, or is just a chapter in larger work. New listeners would be better off going back to the source with  Thunder, Lightning, Strike , but  Get Up Sequences  is a nevertheless solid example of the Go! Team doing what they do best.

Her follow-up,  soft thing , proves that the time between projects was better than well spent.    Candid, smooth and decidedly grown up,  soft thing  conjures the best of the neo-soul era, thanks to LOONY's soulful vocals and lush, crisp production from the likes of Adam Pondang,  Jordon Manswell  and onetime Noah '40' Shebib apprentice  Akeel Henry . There are no thumping, summer anthems on  soft thing  — rather, it's an easygoing listen that can take you from a sangria-fueled kickback to the bedroom without skipping a single song.     As LOONY has risen in R&B's ranks, she's earned comparisons to Erykah Badu and Sade and she certainly proves herself to be a student of these greats with her vocal delivery. Badu's influence shines on ""ours""; LOONY's spitfire pace here borders spoken-word poetry. On the smouldering ""mine,"" LOONY bends her notes and injects softness at just the right moments. On ""raw,"" one of  soft thing 's most vulnerable tracks, LOONY's voice is both the sun and the breeze. Combined with a laid-back blend of soulful guitars, knocking drums and jazzy horns, the whole song plays like a lazy Sunday afternoon.    For more technical music fans,  soft thing 's attention to detail will also stand out. LOONY is in full command of her instrument, playing with power and restraint throughout the project. Sequencing and transitions, overlooked artforms for many artists, are done perfectly as well. If you put the EP on shuffle, you'll miss the way the moments between the music tell a story on their own. Each song flows effortlessly into the next and from the beginning of  soft thing  to the end, the lyrics tell a complete story: at the outset, LOONY is someone who is too proud to let her guard down (opener ""beg"") but by the end of the project, the shameless, late night ""you up?"" texts start flying (closer ""faceless""). It's good on first listen but blooms a little more with each repeat.     Since last year, LOONY has made fans out of Sir Elton John, Ebro Darden and a slew of music critics. While it can be daunting to try and measure up to a bar set so high, LOONY rises to every challenge on  soft thing . If you have yet to put this songbird on your radar, now would be the perfect time.

2021-06-29,Matt Yuyitung,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Possum Lose Themselves to Jam on 'Lunar Gardens',,"Psychedelic rock has always attracted those looking to seek out new worlds — more specifically, it has attracted those who enjoy its combination of trippy, hallucinatory imagery and journeys into spacey, uncharted sonic territory. On  Lunar Gardens , Possum deliver what they describe as a ""surrealist escapist space fantasy of impossible spaces."" What does that mean exactly? How listeners react to the band's forays into cosmic territory will help them figure it out.    Compared to 2019's  Space Grade Assembly ,  Lunar Gardens  is a much a more exploratory record, with the band preferring looser, jazzier jams instead of the driving garage rock of their debut. Sometimes it works very well, particularly over the back half of the record. The acid-jazz stylings of ""Moonjuice"" finds the band playing around on a fun Herbie Hancock-esque vamp, while ""Leyline Riders"" brings some of the rock urgency of their debut into the mix.    The challenge of writing a more improv-heavy record comes with giving purpose to each individual jam-out. There's a fine line between immersive journeys and aimless meandering, and there are moments where time passes without the band saying much — though, for the most part, Possum do a fine job in not straying too far into the wilderness.     It's hard not to miss the urgency and energy of Possum's debut record. Like modern psych overlords King Gizzard, Possum's melding of garage rock, psych and prog made for a wild but very enjoyable ride. That lack of directness on  Lunar Gardens  hinders the band at times, where they get lost in their own ""space fantasy."" But the record has its own share of compelling moments, and shows a band unafraid to dive into new sonic spaces.

2021-06-29,Wesley McLean,9,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Tyler, the Creator Raps Like the Mogul He's Become on 'CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST'",,"There are very few artists in recent memory who've seen as impressive or intriguing an evolution as  Tyler, the Creator . The 30-year-old rapper has transformed from the foul-mouthed leader of chaotic collective  Odd Future  to a  Grammy-award winner  who has continually pushed the boundaries of his music with each release and found success in pretty much every other avenue that he's pursued as well.    He's produced and starred in multiple TV series, launched a clothing line, partnered with several brands and created a popular annual music festival, among other things. He's spent the better part of his career exceeding expectations, growing his brand and becoming a mogul in the process — and now, he's rapping like one.    On  CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST , Tyler is sitting comfortably upon the throne that he's built for himself through his decade-plus-long reign as one of hip-hop's most creative and celebrated figures. It's a complete departure from the experimental R&B-tinged sounds of his Grammy-winning 2019 effort,  IGOR , as he replaces themes of heartbreak and insecurity with an infectious confidence and bravado that carries throughout the project. This is Tyler at his peak, fully aware of what he's accomplished and what he's capable of, making music that feels like a well-deserved victory lap for almost the entirety of its 53-minute runtime.     CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST  showcases Tyler's mastery of his craft after years of improving and expanding upon his signature sound, exploring different musical styles and sharpening his songwriting ability. It also demonstrates how far he's come in terms of building a world and conceptualizing an album. It's an incredible feat, and it's resulted in the rap album that Tyler has always wanted to make.  He's someone who has proudly worn his influences on his sleeve, a student of artists like  Pharrell  and  Lil Wayne , who not only appear as features here but are channelled by Tyler throughout the project in various ways. His production matches the fluidity of Pharrell's early 2000s run, ranging from moments such as the grimy, Gravediggaz-sampling ""LUMBERJACK"" to the softer, more R&B-leaning instrumentation on ""WUSYANAME."" Vocally, he approaches a vast majority of these songs with levels of charisma that rival  Dedication 2 -era Lil Wayne, going for broke on tracks like ""CORSO"" and ""HOT WIND BLOWS.""    That's not the only way in which he hearkens back to Wayne's Dedication tapes, as he's brought series host  DJ Drama  along for the ride. Tyler uses Drama's drops and ad-libs to frame this release as his  Gangsta Grillz  mixtape, though it never actually  feels  like a mixtape, and that's for the better. Tyler has a very commanding presence, both vocally and through the excellent instrumentals that he's crafted, making Drama feel less like the album's host and more like a narrator, part of the world that Tyler has built. The same is true with all of the album's featured artists. Nobody sounds out of place no matter how musically different an artist is from Tyler, whether it be 42 Dugg,  NBA YoungBoy  or  Brent Faiyaz . Instead, they each add to the glamorous and luxurious aesthetic that Tyler has crafted.    That aesthetic and its accompanying narrative are the crown jewel of this album, and it all starts with Tyler's latest alter ego: Tyler Baudelaire, a globetrotting millionaire with the world at his fingertips. Tyler uses this character to deliver opulent tales of international vacations, vivid descriptions of several Rolls Royce interiors and a multitude of high-end fashion pieces that sit in his closet.    While Tyler is no stranger to alter egos, using characters such as Wolf Haley and Igor to contextualize his music and the accompanying narratives throughout his discography, Baudelaire is special. He's a character that's given Tyler an avenue to openly explore the excess and wealth that have become commonplace in his life, celebrating the incredible highs he's experienced, as well as detailing the troubles that have come with it.    On ""WILSHIRE,"" the album's eight-and-a-half-minute-long climax, Tyler Baudelaire's tales of excess and grandeur take a detour, as there's a love story that unfolds, buried between the flights and foreign cars. He's fallen in love with his friend's girlfriend, and he's running around with her together behind his friend's back. Feeling the weight of the guilt that comes with it, he calls it off to preserve the friendships and relationships at stake. It's a moment that shows that though he can have pretty much anything that he wants, the one thing that he truly desires is unattainable. It's an instance of vulnerability on an album otherwise overflowing with braggadocio, and a truly special moment in Tyler's discography.    That same sentiment applies to this entire release as well, as it's a tremendous feat. There's a scintillating swagger to  CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST  that permeates through almost every verse and is accented by just how luxurious the instrumentation feels, with DJ Drama's boisterous detailing of Tyler's lavish lifestyle and exquisite expeditions serving as a perfect garnish.    It's an album that sounds like wealth not just because of its content but by the way it's presented and complemented by all of the surrounding elements. Tyler has delivered a project that yet again pushes the boundaries of his music while simultaneously being a culmination of everything that he's done so far. It's yet another impressive outing for an artist whose reign doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon.

Half Waif ) that causes people to describe her art in such a lavish manner? Reviews for last year's sweeping and cascading  The Caretaker  found critics focusing more on her emotions than her actual craft, using billowing language like ""supersaturated moments of her past"" (to quote  our own review ). Writing and recording her fifth full-length throughout a year where it was easy to connect to everyone else's pain, Rose's music finally doesn't seem so distant, so mysterious or so yearning.    But that's not to say that this LP isn't affecting — the New York musician finds her craft ebbing and flowing through innumerable moods, albeit more human than ethereal this time around. The relatability that Rose exudes on  Mythopoetics  makes the album title somewhat ironic. ""Sourdough"" pulls few punches lyrically, as it's easy to understand the symbolism behind this gorgeously direct piano ballad, while the swirling synths of ""Orange Blossoms"" connects her own helplessness with the loneliness her father shares at the same moment.    Given Rose's typical arrangements of layered vocals, piano, synths and beats, there's nothing really sonically different about this latest LP that she hasn't shown us before. But on tracks like the aerated ""The Apartment"" and the echoing ""Sodium & Cigarettes,"" she doesn't merely play with her delivery as she's done many times in the past — here, she instead allows her songs to unravel and flow in different directions. Opening track ""Fabric"" is a brief solo keys-and-voice piece that features a barely-there chorus, while the dance-beat-aided follow-up ""Swimmer"" and the delicate synth haze of ""Party's Over"" show Rose pushing her voice through a number of modes, including Kate Bush-style high-resister top-ups and playful rhythmic coupling, all anchored by big, soaring choruses.    The scratchy, spiralling ""Fortress"" and the earthy ""Midnight Asks"" follow this blueprint closely, showing Rose keeping each song relatively contained within the same space, as everything runs around the same three-to-four-minute mark. But that doesn't make Rose's latest LP anything less than an achievement, as the stuttering, clashing ""Take Away the Ache"" and the pop-facing ""Horse Racing"" come off as career highlights.  Mythopoetics  may be Rose's most approachable album, but that just means that the world has finally caught up with Half Waif's wide-lens world.

2021-07-06,Sydney Brasil,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Meggie Lennon Sets a Sultry Mood on 'Sounds from Your Lips',,"Meggie Lennon  wants to create a realm of nostalgia, yearning for both the recent past and beyond.  Sounds from Your Lips  is a promising solo debut from the former leader of Quebec City's Aberdeen, building an environment that oscillates between space-y, bright and melancholic.    Lennon is very clearly inspired by the psych-pop leanings of 2010s indie pop. This influence is extremely on-the-nose, with much of the record recalling Weyes Blood and Melody's Echo Chamber. More locally, ""Mind Games"" leans to the wobbly tones of fellow Montrealers Men I Trust. Lennon's reverberated vocals are delivered with soft inflection and almost act as another instrument. There's also a touch of '80s electronica in the Depeche Mode-esque synthline of ""Lost in the Plot."" In this way,  Sounds from Your Lips  straddles the line between luminous and pensive. This is on-brand for Lennon, who describes her sound as ""makeout dream pop."" The album accomplishes this in being both sensual and foggy, feeling like a stoned, sunny afternoon.    All of the songs on the record are structurally simple, which complements how the instruments take up space. Much of the album's rhythm guitar is acoustic and clean in tone, cutting through straightforward lead guitar and synth parts. This creates a significant amount of room on the tracks, contributing to the aura of the album as a whole — which is dreamy but could benefit from a little more energy. The record's optimistic opener ""Night Shift"" is an exception to this, its melodic bassline leading to the album's most satisfying crescendo. This optimism ties together what seems to be Lennon's creative vision, as she writes graceful songs with few parts and a larger mission in mind: setting a mood.     Songs from Your Lips  is well-produced and highlights Lennon's knack for arranging songs artfully, with her stylistic choices providing room for future growth. Though her influences are clear, the album doesn't do much to expand outward. Instead, it chooses to focus on creating an atmosphere in which the songs are placed delicately. From here, perhaps Lennon can take her strength in mood-setting and flex her strong songwriting muscles, moving from building ambience into more immersive concepts.

Her personality fills up the audio and every room she performs in. She's unwaveringly proud of herself and doesn't need anyone to tell her to be, writing celebratory lines like ""They used to call me a dreamer / Now they reflect off my beamer"" and ""I might take your bitch, I think she kinda want me.""    Based around simple themes of fashion, flexing, and making your own money,  PRADO MONROE , her debut EP, delivers six hook-heavy tracks in less than 20 minutes. It features her trademark lyrical flare and a dash of humour reminiscent of artists like MIA and Megan Thee Stallion (Like on ""Gucci Store"" quip ""They said I was stupid but bitch I can spell, G-L-A-M-R-O-U-S"").    The record's contagious vocal melodies and Hollywood-slick production are perfect for days when you need a boost and reminder of how hot and deserving you are. Prado is her own champion, and through her music she tries to teach listeners how to be too, leading by example using bursts of rap and sing-songy, choppy vocals as her medium.    At large,  PRADO MONROE  reads as a record about Prado's desires and rebellion against any confines placed upon her sexuality and personality. But closer up, it's a demonstration of her wit and vocal range. You might not know the full story behind a chorus — ""I don't give a fuck if you like me, Stephen""  — but the specifics aren't necessary to feel the energy of the music and ride the wave of self-love anthems like ""DRIP"" and ""GUCCI STORE.""    When this album hits the clubs, it'll hit them hard. Prado's live performance brings energy from a squad of back-up dancers and avid fans, and that vibe is sure to extend to venues once they start opening up again. It's a record to hear through industrial-grade subwoofers, to shake your body to in a room of others dressed to the nines.  PRADO MONROE  is a celebration of Prado's ego, made digestible through bubbly, shiny alternative pop production.

2021-06-18,Mark Tremblay,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Anthesis, Cell Press, Greber and Botfly Try New Things on Their Four-Way Split Album",,"Four very different heavy bands in  Anthesis ,  Cell Press ,  Greber  and  Botfly  have come together on a new split album. Even though each band has a different approach to heavy music, the songs work together to create an all-encompassing full length that flows cohesively from beginning to end. The album highlights some of the best bands in Canadian heavy music, and showcases their most daring material to date.    The album begins with the ""Breaking Tired Limbs"" by New Brunswick-based sludge and grindcore outfit Anthesis. Instead of their typical technical fare, Anthesis have opted for their slowest and bleakest riffs to date. The song slowly builds through a dissonant riff that eventually boils over into frenetic array of blast beats and unorthodox rhythmic patterns.     Cell Press trade in their hardcore tendencies for their take on stoner metal music. The infectious grooves of ""Terminal Knave"" and ""Cell Prescient"" are punishingly heavy while bringing in shades of Goatsnake to the mix. Anyone expecting more of the same from Cell Press will be pleasantly surprised by their attempt at an atypical metal sub-genre.    Greber's entry on this album results in their heaviest material to date. Both ""Old Losers"" and ""Tove Lough"" see Greber channeling the likes of Primitive Man and creating more atmospheric and immense music than on their previous releases. Employing a 'less is more' approach to song composition, Greber's balance of melody against sheer abrasiveness makes for their most nuanced music to date, segueing nicely into the album's closing act.     Halifax post-hardcore heavyweights Botfly close the album with ""Confessions of Depression,"" built around looping a catchy riff and trading harsh vocals for a more melodic vocal delivery. The result is one of the most indie rock-leaning songs in the Botfly's catalogue, ending the album on a strong note while highlighting the band's many avenues to future success and acclaim.    None of the cohesion on the album would be possible without the work of Clouds Become Oceans, the ambient project of Anthesis guitarist Scott Miller. His instrumentals between each of the bands' sections provide a logical transition regardless of the variety of styles from each act. It's a bold move that helps bring the four bands together, resulting in an excellent collection of music from some of Canada's most promising heavy artists.

Each release represents a different sonic facet of the band, spanning the gamut of punk music. While covering topics about misogyny, consent, personal growth and the plight of toxic relationships,  BECKY  and  DARLENE  are full of anthemic and melodic moments throughout while simultaneously questioning the patriarchy.     BECKY  is full of adolescent tales re-contextualized through a reflective adult lens. It serves as the poppier, more-garage punk-leaning release, coloured in nostalgia for the days of adolescence. Vocalist Kirsten White recalls the likes of Matt Korvette by employing a wide range of voices to breathe life into the many characters she embodies on the record, from the tales of sexual liberation on ""OICA"" to analyzing toxic relationships on ""Goldie.""  BECKY 's peak is the Armed-influenced ""Tony Danza,"" featuring a hypnotic guitar pattern and an assault of snare fills.     On the darker and more sinister  DARLENE , the band turn up the grimy tones and lean more into their hardcore and dissonant influences. White's raspy vocals channel her unfiltered rage towards societal norms and sexual assault through songs like ""Eat My Feelings"" and ""Paid Drinks."" The line ""It's my attire, attracting you closer and closer, as you're breathing down my neck"" is both chilling and evocative. Guitarist Joni Cassidy really shines on this EP — her riffs on ""Cut Tongues"" sound like Kyuss masquerading as a hardcore band.      PRETTYBOY's two EPs function as a perfect call and response to each other. The way these releases continually revisit narratives requires multiple listens to get all of the band's hidden meanings. ​The stories that PRETTYBOY tell on  BECKY  and  DARLENE  push the anti-establishment ethos of classic punk into bold terrain.

2021-06-18,Matt Bobkin,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Kings of Convenience Return at the Perfect Time on 'Peace or Love',,"With each year that passed since  Kings of Convenience 's 2009 album,  Declaration of Dependence , their idiosyncratic brand of acoustic folk fell further out of favour with the zeitgeist. The indie folk bands that followed them into the spotlight, from scrappy indie upstarts Fleet Foxes to major label bandwagoners like Mumford and Suns, burst onto the scene and went electric in the years since the Kings' last album dropped.    Built around the ethos of ""quiet is the new loud"" (also the name of  their 2001 debut album ) the Norwegian duo challenged their listeners to slow down and shut up to take in the rich details of their hushed vocals and pleasantly strummed guitars, even going as far as  asking concert venues to close bars during their sets to minimize noise . Somehow, they've picked the perfect time to return, 16 months into a global pandemic that has turned the promise of a bustling room into an anxiety attack in the making. On  Peace or Love , the Kings traverse the dichotomy cheekily expressed in the album title guided by their signature brand of wistfulness and longing, now mixed with the wisdom of age.    Revisiting their sonic trademarks, including tight harmonies, lovelorn lyrics and some appearances from Feist (who's certainly grown in popularity since she showed up on the Kings'  Riot on an Empty Street  in 2004),  Peace or Love  doesn't tread new ground, but offers a pleasant reminder of what made them stand out in the first place, at the perfect time. Thew album's not always smooth (the strutting ""Angel"" finds the pair singing about an ""angel, though she might be, just slightly, promiscuous"") but it hits its mark when the pair opt for tender, lovelorn observations, as on lead single ""Rocky Trail,"" which hums with an undercurrent of keys and violins (and the sounds of someone softly clicking their teeth to the beat) as the duo reflect honestly and candidly on shortcomings at the end of a relationship: ""How am I to know about your problems and your load? / I am blind to what you show, I am waiting to be told / I never ask.""    The airy baritones of Eirik Glambek Bøe and Erlend Øye still sound like they were born to fit perfectly together, and they sing with the unpretentious patience of the adults on  Sesame Street , lending an endearing quality to even the most obvious observations such as on the self-explanatory ""Ask for Help"": ""If you got the will to do it / But you lack the skills to do it good / Ask for help."" There's plenty of stylistic depth to stop things from plodding along too slowly, such as the bossa nova stylings of ""Angel"" and ""Catholic Country,"" and their jokingly half-hearted attempt to recreate disco with two acoustic guitars on ""Fever"" (""Of a different kind,"" they clarify). Feist's two appearances lack the dramatic heft of her turns on  Riot on an Empty Street , but her voice still tangos with Bøe's with the candour of old friends.     Bøe and Øye have always confronted any bit of uncertainty and frustration by taking things slow and talking them out — it's not necessarily thrilling or exciting, but it's certainly conducive to growth. Though eschewing the (mild, but still present) domestic theatrics of their earlier works for more wizened fare may have muted their immediate impact, their knack for immersive melodies and grooves keep things compelling. Kings of Convenience have never needed to be revelatory to be worth listening to, and  Peace or Love  is just as endearing and enjoyable at a time when lighthearted fare might be hard to come by.

2021-06-21,Alex Hudson,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Mother Mother's 'Inside' Is an Evergreen Pandemic Album,,"Of all the 2000s rock bands to get huge on TikTok, who could have ever guessed that it would be  Mother Mother ? The Vancouver band released a couple of weird, genre-warping indie folk albums more than a decade ago, and since then have been humming along steadily as a moderately successful major label rock band. They had seemingly reached their final state.    And yet, practically overnight, Mother Mother are doing interviews with  James Corden  and  Rolling Stone  about their enormous success among Gen Z listeners and  in the trans community . Not bad for a band 15 years and eight albums into their career.    Their latest LP,  Inside , reunites them with producer  Howard Redekopp , who they haven't worked with since 2008's career-best album  O My Heart . While that choice of producer could cynically be interpreted as a way to cash in on  O My Heart 's sudden popularity,  Inside  doesn't actually sound much like their early music. Unlike the stripped-down quirkiness of their most beloved material,  Inside  is dense and dark, careening between inspirational anthems and heavy synth-rock.    As a pandemic record, it's sometimes a bit on-the-nose: it's bookended by the sound of people banging pots and pans in support of heath care workers, and several songs allude to isolation or include the word ""inside."" But for the most part,  Inside  grapples with issues of empowerment and self-love — timely themes that feel in-step with the band's younger fanbase.    The chugging rocker  ""I Got Love""  and the hymnal ""Pure Love"" both celebrate an abstract, universal sense of love (rather than romantic);  ""Forgotten Souls""  offers comfort for those dealing with mental health struggles or suicidal ideation, its acoustic stomp shifting into a direct allusion to the Pixies' ""Monkey Gone to Heaven""; the new wave rager ""Sick of the Silence"" describes suppressed psychic pain, with singer Ryan Guldemond giving his most aggressive, guttural vocal performance yet. The reverb is thick, coating the album in a haze that's sometimes eerie, sometimes comforting.     Inside  is an album of emotional extremes: ""Weep"" careens between heavily distorted riffs and quiet acoustic comedowns, while ""Seven"" and ""Breath"" are instrumental mood pieces that sound straight out of a horror movie. Guldemond tends to act as the group's raw-nerved id, while singer-keyboardists Molly Guldemond and Jasmin Parkin occasionally take the mic to offer more calm, comforting coos (both as backing vocalists and as occasional leads).    It's may not sound much like  O My Heart , but it's a compelling reflection of the mental turmoil that, for so many people, is bubbling just under the surface. Even if  Inside  is clearly inspired by the pandemic, its lessons are applicable anytime.

2021-06-21,Dylan Barnabe,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Lucy Dacus' Look to Her Past on 'Home Video' Heralds Her Bright Future,,"There's no place like home. Though, for 26-year-old indie star  Lucy Dacus , who shot to fame after the successes of both 2016's  No Burden  and 2018's  Historian , home has become more of a symbolic pursuit than an actual physical place. On her third album,  Home Video , Dacus turns back the hands of time and returns to her roots as she chronicles the bittersweet tales of growing up in Richmond, VA.    The album is a starkly honest and unabashed look at what it means to find your footing, fall in love and forge your own path. Opener ""Hot & Heavy"" immediately places us in Dacus' shoes, home at last: ""Being back here makes me hot in the face / hot blood in my pulsing veins / heavy memories weighing on my brain."" The physical and mental effects of her homecoming are palpable and set the tone for the album.    Throughout the following 10 tracks, she deftly manoeuvres the intersections of identity, religion, sexuality, loss and longing with vulnerability and compassion well beyond her years. While some artists might wade too deep into the pool of full-blown nostalgia, Dacus manages to pull off an impressive level of self-awareness that anchors her firmly in the present, looking back openly on memories from a safe distance.    Dacus has long been heralded for her ability as a raconteur, and  Home Video  further cements this reputation. It is a deeply personal album filled with raw vignettes of young adulthood that claw at our collective consciousness. She strips back her usual edge and slows down to a gentle pulse, ceding centre stage to the hushed intimacy of her most tightly held memories.    Given the famous state slogan ""Virginia is for lovers!,"" it's hardly surprising that matters of the heart figure prominently on  Home Video . ""Triple Dog Dare"" explores forbidden queer love in the Bible Belt, ""Partner in Crime"" tells of a breaking curfew to meet up with an older love interest, and ""Christine"" achingly documents losing a close friend to a problematic relationship. Interactions as simple as the boy from Bible camp whose ""poetry was so bad / It took a lot to not laugh"" or the ""sweaty palms, averted eyes"" that accompany first butterflies bring back the pangs of being young at heart.    This is not without small glimpses of Dacus' sly sense of humour. On ""Brando"", for example, she teases mercilessly: ""You called me cerebral, I didn't know what you meant / but now I do, would it have killed you to call me pretty instead?"" Long-term fans will also be happy to finally see the inclusion of ""Thumbs"" as part of the official track list, as well as see Dacus joined by the voices of her boygenius bandmates, Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker, on the choruses of ""Please Stay"" and ""Going Going Gone.""    There's no doubt that Dacus has become one of this generation's singular songwriters. Like Bridgers and Baker, her talent for tapping into the universal through song is remarkably potent. While Dacus sings of the future as a ""benevolent black hole"" on ""Cartwheel,"" it's clear that her future shines bright.   ( Matador )                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Lucy Dacus",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/lucy_dacus_home_video_album_review
2021-06-21,Leslie Ken Chu,8,"POP AND ROCK,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Gong Gong Gong 工工工 Filter Their Psych Odysseys Through China's Ravenous Electronic Scene on 'Phantom Rhythm Remixed 幽靈節奏',,"Montréal-Beijing duo  Gong Gong Gong 工工工  transcend geographical and musical borders with psychedelic rock odysseys through West African desert blues and New York no wave. Tom Ng sings in Cantonese while driving the rhythm on guitar. The alchemy between his coarse strokes and Joshua Frank's parched bass lines creates illusory percussion, hence the name of Gong Gong Gong's 2019 full-length debut,  Phantom Rhythm 幽靈節奏 .    For Gong Gong Gong's latest album,  Phantom Rhythm Remixed 幽靈節奏 , Frank and Ng have invited 10 electronic producers to reinterpret the band's entrancing, minimalist compositions; even the original track order has been shuffled. All the guests share a connection to China, either by birth, residence, or their work history. Many of them have also collaborated with Gong Gong Gong in the past, including: Frank's brother Simon, who's based in Beijing; Copenhagen's Angel Wei, who improvised alongside Gong Gong Gong on their 2020  Rytme og Drone III  tape; and Kaifeng-born, Vancouver-based  Yu Su , whose debut album  Yellow River Blue  features bass contributions from Frank.    Each contributor takes the resourceful duo's music in wildly unique directions. Jonathan Schenke of P.E. blows up ""Ride Your Horse 騎你的馬"" into a roaming free-jazz chariot ride through resonant piano chords that dangle over snapping percussion. Knopha deconstructs the wind tunnel gust of ""Sound of Love 愛歌"" into squeaky, skittering, skeletal techno; in this form, the song could pass as a Liquid Liquid demo, minus the influential dance-punks' clanging drums, cowbells, and tambourines. Beijing's Howie Lee defies expectations as always, diving headlong into heavy rock by applying real drums slathered with buckets of industrial sludge to ""Gong Gong Gong Blues 工工工 布魯斯.""    Speaking of industrial, Chinese producers like those of Shanghai label SVBKVLT are making some of the most riveting dark techno today. Beijing group and SVBKVLT alumni Zaliva-D bring some of this darkness to  Phantom Rhythm Remixed  with their reworking of ""Inner Reaches III 慾望的暗角三."" Their version bellows. Its prowling beat swings like a pendulum as it advances. Ng's vocals cut out abruptly, exacerbating the unsettling mood. But the most haunting track comes from Taipei's masters of tension, Scattered Purgatory 破地獄. Though they don't alter the chiming ""Hotpot (Chongqing) 火鍋 （重慶)"" much, they downshift it and add discordant, reverberating effects.    The thrusting ""Notes Underground 地下日記"" becomes a sedated drawl in the hands of psychedelic brother duo Mong Tong 夢東, also from Taipei. The original riff now sputters like a broken siren. Likewise, Ng's vocals are choppy and slurred. Underneath it all, clinking metal, samples of punching and kicking sounds from classic kung fu films, and subterranean drums churn. On the other end of the spectrum, Chengdu's Wu Zhuoling builds ""Wei Wei Wei 喂喂喂"" into the most kinetic and instantly catchy track on  Phantom Rhythm Remixed . Ng sounds like he's rapping to keep up with her added breakbeats. She shifts the pitch of his voice, accentuating the track's deep club vibe. But it's Yu Su who lightens the mood more than anyone else with ""Some Kind of Demon 某一種惡魔."" Fuelled by a drum machine and synth, the track rises like hot air. It's heavenly respite from the rest of the album's intensity.    Cultural censorship accelerates Chinese club-goers' appetite for new sounds. Listeners rapidly absorb whatever filters through (often via VPNs), leading to a high turnover in trends. But this insularity also allows the country's underground music to evolve in unique ways. With  Phantom Rhythm Remixed , Gong Gong Gong add another link to that evolutionary chain as they continue to fold musical styles across borders of every kind.

This has been his calling card since his 2012 debut,  Nick Ferrio and His Feelings , and while that album's country twang is mostly absent from his recent works, its spirit is not. As evidenced by his stints working with  the Burning Hell  and  Leanne Betasamosake Simpson , his musical prowess could never be doubted.     On his fifth album,  Television of Roses , the Georgina, ON-based folk-rocker largely forgoes the layered complexity of his older works that gave songs such as ""That's Not How I Remember It"" (from 2017's  Soothsayer ) or ""Anxiety"" (from 2018's  Have a Nice Day ) depth and texture, in favour of using simplicity as the sonic bedrock of emotionality. When this clicks, the album soars. What sets Ferrio's music apart from his peers is an earnestness that shines through the tracks — tracks such as ""The Dam"" and ""Worthy of Love,"" Ferrio bares his soul, digging into childhood trauma and present-day worries to lay something intriguing over the top of riffs that radiate warmth and familiarity from the first listen.     ""The Dam"" in particular is a huge breath of fresh air into the stuffy lungs of folk-rock. It's sonically stirring and lyrically powerful as Ferrio responds to a letter from his late mother where she asked him to remember her from ""before her struggles with alcohol began."" The gut-wrenching theme elevates the simple acoustic guitar riff into classic folk song territory.     Elsewhere, however, his palette sounds less inspired. This is shown in tracks like ""Solid Maybe,"" which offer little interesting in terms of tone or lyrics, ultimately falling flat. The mid-tempo beat combined with heard-before riffs make its four minutes feel like a meandering and directionless take on the sounds of the Beach Boys, Sloan and Sam Roberts.      Television of Roses  oscillates unevenly between these two modes, but fans of Ferrio and Beatles-esque folk rock will certainly find plenty to enjoy.

The Bay Area-based vocalist has already  picked up a Grammy Award  for 2020 single ""I Can't Breathe"" and an Oscar for  Judas and the Black Messiah  track ""Fight for You,"" while managing to squeeze in a Super Bowl national anthem performance in the middle of these momentous milestones. Whether it was showcasing her vocal range or the socially conscious depth of her songwriting, H.E.R. has undoubtedly arrived in 2021.    However, she may have made an even bolder statement by releasing a front-to-back heater of an album with  Back of My Mind , where her mastery of all levels of music making is showcased to its fullest extent.    Upon first listen, it's hard to believe the level of maturity and industry navigation the 23-year-old artist has achieved. If her previous projects were essentially compilations of various EPs, this thoroughly cohesive album sees her co-producing along the likes of A-listers such as  Hit-Boy  and  Mike WiLL Made-It . In what feels like a perfectly assembled 80-minute R&B master class, H.E.R. finds a way to balance collaborations from all sides of the music industry, managing meaningful features by everyone from hip-hop heavyweights  Chris Brown ,  YG ,  Ty Dolla $ign  and  Lil Baby  to breakthrough iconoclasts  Kaytranada ,  Thundercat  and  Cordae . More than just romantic languish and sexually tense ballads, H.E.R. expands the reach of her genre of choice with the themes she covers, her effortless penmanship and her underrated guitar work.    Ephemeral R&B vibes are the glue that makes the album flow seemingly, but H.E.R. displays tremendous comfort in adapting her signature sounds to the needs of her guests. Even if the puzzling presence of  DJ Khaled  on ""I Can Have It All"" seems like payback for  her recent feature on his Migos collab , H.E.R. takes the opportunity on that very track to go toe-to-toe with trap soul heavyweight  Bryson Tiller . Whether it's the ""Making Love in the Rain"" sample on ""Damage"" or the epic Thundercat bassline on ""Bloody Waters,"" H.E.R.'s sultry vocals are perfectly mixed into a warm and varied musical backdrop. That is how more political lyrics of empowering relationship posturing are able to meld smoothly into the album's sonic continuity. Finally, in an album defined by balance, ""Mean It"" and ""Exhausted"" provide listeners with the hurt feeling R&B subject matter they came to hear.

2021-06-23,Adam Fink,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,R&B,MUSIC",Janette King Sounds Like a Seasoned Pro on Debut Album 'What We Lost',,"Everyone has spent the past year reconciling with loss. Amid a pandemic and myriad social uprisings, the state of the world has come starkly into focus. On her debut album,  What We Lost ,  Janette King  takes on the aftermath of grief and loss, looks at these issues unflinchingly, and attempts to find her own resolution.    The Montreal-based/Vancouver-born producer, artist and songwriter has crafted an album that takes a cold, hard look at life and death. social problems. and their relationship to her own life. While focusing on her own relationship with loss, King makes her personal message one that rings out universally, all the while wrapping it up in a pristinely produced masterclass of R&B sheen.    King unpacks a lot of her own personal grief on  What We Lost . The loss of a relationship, the loss of family and friends, and her own experiences with a loss of self. It's startling to listen to her tackle such deeply personal issues and how she has been able to use these to produce affecting art. On ""Change,"" produced with Jordan Esau, King speaks out about her relationship with police violence against the Black community. When she sings, ""I'm no longer sad / I don't want your pity / I want change,"" it's deeply stirring to hear her simply state this in such plain terms. Her message here is one that should upset you, but also inspire you to make the intention to help create a better world for everyone. As a protest song, it succeeds on every level — and as an exquisitely produced hip-hop track, it shines. King seamlessly jumps between genres across  What We Lost . One of the album's highlights, ""Found a Way,"" blends house beats with King's keen ear for pop melodies. There are hints of Erykah Badu, Solange and Janet Jackson — but even with these touchstones, she makes the sound entirely her own.    Janette King has made a very special debut album that ought to place King right near the top of the list of this country's up-and-coming R&B artists.  What We Lost  is fully realized and has a confidence that is well beyond King's years. The album's title track finds King flirting with techno, and it's something that would fit comfortably on a playlist beside Ela Minus, while ""You Don't Love Me"" wouldn't seem out of place sandwiched between any Alicia Keys tracks. To do all of this while sounding completely herself is a reflection of King's strength as a songwriter.

2021-06-22,Paul Blinov,7,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Lightman Jarvis Ecstatic Band's 'Banned' Finds Beauty in Unpredictability,,"Sprawling over 200 acres of precambrian shield near Gravenhurst, ON, is an outdoor art gallery called the Tree Museum. It's hosted some 80 artists in residence since 1998, letting them create works that engage with — and add to — its uncultivated landscape. It's also the site of creation for  Lightman Jarvis Ecstatic Band , a collaboration between  Yves Jarvis  and  Tasseomancy 's Romy Lightman. The pair decamped to the Tree Museum for two weeks of improvisational creation, with Lightman on synths, Jarvis on drums and guitar, and the landscape itself as an adroit creative partner.     Banned , the resulting album, blurs the lines between internal and external space. Its 15 tracks manifest sounds as sculpture, emphasizing textures as much as melodies, and, restlessly twisting, like the field recording of a dream. Lead single ""Elastic Band"" is key entry point: a rubbery bass line and stomping drum pattern carry its whispery, echoing vocals, finding moments of melody and emotional tumult as instruments drop in and out.     Moods are conjured in unpredictable, shifting ways: the instrumental ""Becoming"" pairs vaporwave reverberations with unpredictable staccato notes for a meditative effect, while ""Mother's Rope"" finds a more ominous, Jandek-ish tone with the repetition of lines like ""someone broke character"" over a clattering beat. The tireless drum run of ""Bone of a Hound"" builds emotions with a snaking bass line, before giving way to the twisty rhythms of ""Ein Sof.""    Some of its improvisations feel more impenetrable than others. But the album's unpredictable nature gives it some of its finest moments: ""Stomach Pit"" starts as a rattling jam that suddenly reshapes itself around a beautiful vocal with handclap backing. It feels like a discovery, and with moments like that,  Banned  seems as much of a place you explore as an album you put on. It beckons you to disappear into the surroundings it conjures, to look for its hidden gems, to let the improvisational creativity that forged it wash over you, too. It's a big ask, but a credit to the strength of its collaborators that doing so offers so many rewards.

2021-06-10,Megan LaPierre,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Dizzy Take Road Testing into Their Own Hands on 'Separate Places' EP,,"2020 was not the trip around the sun  Dizzy  were hoping to take. The Oshawa indie pop band's sophomore album,  The Sun and Her Scorch , hasn't yet had the chance to be road-worn. Ahead of its release last July, the quartet of Katie Munshaw and brothers Charlie, Alex and Mackenzie Spencer had begun a winter U.K. stint supporting Oh Wonder. The pandemic inevitably had other plans.     The Sun and Her Scorch  showed a young band that had come into their own and taken control of their sound. Dizzy's 2018 debut,  Baby Teeth , was a dark Bildungsroman that revelled in lush electronic flourishes courtesy of producer Damian Taylor ( the Killers ,  Arcade Fire ,  Temper Trap ). The band produced the record themselves this time around, shedding the ambient soundscape for something more organic and authentic to who they'd grown into. Thematically, it reckoned with mortality from a place of greater existential clarity, armed with the survival instinct that knowingly carried them through adolescence.    It's standard to hear an acoustic version or remix of a song from an artist, but this trend has ramped up in musicians' pandemic innovation: Toronto pop artist  ELIO  recently released a remix album alongside collaborators like  Charli XCX  and  Babygirl ; before that,  Phoebe  Bridgers  released an EP with Rob Moose's orchestral re-arrangements of a handful of  Punisher  tracks. Songs take on many lives, and what's recorded has usually gone through many stages of development. Remodeling and remaking isn't novel — but artists figuring out how to translate songs from off the studio floor to a live performance often helps set continued evolution in motion.     Separate Places  is Dizzy's way of breathing new life into some of the songs they've barely had the opportunity to play. The EP features five album cuts — including singles ""The Magician,"" ""Sunflower"" and ""Beatrice"" — reimagined with the help of different guests. Said collaborators come from separate places as near as Toronto ( Luna Li ) and as far as London, U.K. (Flyte). They range in stature from Kevin Garrett, who's previously collaborated with  Beyoncé , to relative-unknown Jahnah Camille, a 16-year-old rising singer-songwriter from Alabama. Each brings something from their own stylistic arsenal to assist in recasting Dizzy's sonic vision.    Beneath their gleaming synthpop surfaces, songs like ""The Magician"" and ""Sunflower"" evade immediate exposure of their heavy lyrical content. In the former's case, the ache at its core becomes more readily apparent with Luna Li on ""The Bird Behind The Drapes."" She and Munshaw play call-and-response from different spectral planes over muted piano chords and muffled conversations, culminating in a cinematic crescendo of cascading strings. Meanwhile, Garrett eases the existential dread of ""Sunflower"" on ""Sunflower, Are You There?"" with a hand-in-pocket guitar groove and crunchy backbeat.    ""10PM"" and ""Beatrice St. E"" are more stripped back versions of original tracks ""Ten"" and ""Beatrice,"" respectively; the former is now a front-porch acoustic duet with Camille, while on the latter,  Overcoats  lend their signature ethereal harmonies atop Munshaw's, where the EP draws its title from the solemn refrain, ""We head home again to separate places."" It's a similar feel on Flyte-featuring ""Primrose Hill at Midnight,"" with Will Taylor's trademark vocal multitracking hauntingly repeating, ""Anywhere you go / I'll be there to dote"" throughout its final third. The ballad gets some added edge from an insistent pulse of whirring low-end-frequencies and the London trio's sweeping harmonic envelope.    Could Dizzy have expanded their musical palette even further by working with artists with drastically different sounds than theirs? Absolutely. But that doesn't seem to be the intention with  Separate Places ; it's more of an exercise in imagining growth processes the band might come by naturally. They chose to collaborate with musicians who already shared many of their stylistic values and didn't aim to fit their songs into the molds of disparate genres: they partnered with artists they believed could highlight what they had present — or were at least leaning toward — on  The Sun and Her Scorch .    As a result,  Separate Places  doesn't traverse vastly uncharted musical terrain for Dizzy. However, it shows the band's desire to grow and their intuitive sense of direction. Some of the collaborators on this EP even bring out echoes of  Baby Teeth , beckoning back to the band's past lives; and a willingness to embrace the bittersweet sense of cyclicality is a form of branching out in and of itself.

2021-06-10,Daryl Keating,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,EP,MUSIC",Ciel and Dan Only Push Toronto's Electronic Scene to 'The Limit' on Debut Cloudsteppers EP,,"You haven't heard of  Cloudsteppers  because this is their first release, but the individual members might ring a bell.  Dan Only  (a.k.a. Danny Voicu) has had a tidy selection of melodic, house-y bangers released over the past few years on New Kanada and Dirt Crew Recordings. The other half,  Ciel  (a.k.a. Cindy Li) has, similarly, been racking up a slew of EPs on various labels in recent times. She also runs Work in Progress and is a key member of It's Not U It's Me, both of which have been responsible for booking some major acts for Toronto's partygoers. Needless to say, this is a joint effort between two of the city's pivotal producers, so no doubt many are curious to hear what this collaboration sounds like.    As they should be;  The Limit  is a superb all-rounder that runs the gamut of house, techno, breakbeat and more. All it really takes is the first skittering smacks of the title track to draw you right into the centre of this EP, and once you're there, you'll happily stay put for the duration. ""The Limit"" is a mean jungle track — there's no other way to say it. It has a sample of Brian Cox during the breakdown, and hearing his intellectual musings amongst some quick-fire percussion works so well that it seems ridiculous no one has matched the Mancunian physicist with jungle in the past. The drum programming is simply top notch, and it continues that way for the entire EP. This is a percussion-heavy record.    After hearing the opener, you might think it's hard to top, but ""Diva Loops"" is a serious contender. The kick drum makes an aggressive b-line for the primordial parts of your brain, sending ""move yo body"" signals to the limbs in very short order. This is then propped up by deliciously wonky bass, before some spacey squiggles (à la Luke Vibert) enter the fray about halfway through.     If  The Limit  is the result of a few impromptu jam sessions over the last couple of years, then we're very excited to hear what these two can come up with in the future.  Now  you've heard of Cloudsteppers.

2021-06-10,Adam Feibel,3,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",AFI's 'Bodies' Is Mostly Lifeless,,"Thirty years into their career,  AFI  seem due for a resurgence. While most of their peers from their mid-2000s heyday have fallen victim to time, the veteran band have pressed forward and arrived at a point in time when there's a reasonably sizable cross-section of young punks, elder emos and new-age goths that would gladly welcome an AFI comeback. The band's  self-titled record — a.k.a.  The Blood Album  —  could've done it in 2017, but it wasn't quite the return to form that it could have been. Still, it's theirs for the taking.    With  Bodies , AFI have totally blown it. Rather than try again to reclaim their former glory, they've made a mostly lifeless album that puts them at perhaps their lowest moment. The best of AFI is delivered with full force, combining punk-rock ferocity with a flair for the melodramatic. Here, they barely commit.  Bodies  offers a dark, modern take on '80s post-punk that's too uninspired even for drive-time rock radio. Sometimes, they themselves don't even sound all that interested.     Davey Havok's iffy pursuit of nü-new wave with Dreamcar — his supergroup with the non-Gwen Stefani members of No Doubt — continues here with AFI. In the band's output since  Decemberunderground , the influences of the Cure, Depeche Mode and Joy Division were noticeable enough; here, it's full-on pastiche, and it's already worn thin. Not only is there another California-based group of former hardcore punks that have already taken this same path of new-wave revivalism (see the works of Ceremony since 2015), but AFI's own pivot finds them falling flat by just about every measure.     It's promising at first. The revved-up snare rolls and machine-gun guitars of ""Twisted Tongues"" are legitimately exhilarating. While not as explosive as one would hope, it's a frantic opener that tends toward AFI's known strengths. But that's as exciting as it gets. The band's playing is perfunctory and Havok's melodies even more so. Even on higher-energy tunes like ""Far Too Near,"" ""On Your Back"" and ""Begging for Trouble,"" the choruses are overly simple and utterly soulless. Havok's voice is normally a sharp-edged blade to be wielded with dynamic, striking force, yet the hooks he's written for this album are duller than a butter knife. He occasionally lets his voice soar — like in the synth-washed chorus of ""Dulceria"" — but those moments are rare. To his credit, Hunter Burgan has turned in some top-notch bass lines, but the intensity and inventiveness of guitarist Jade Puget and drummer Adam Carson have been hammered out of them. For the most part, these songs basically sound like they were composed of the first, most rudimentary ideas that occurred to the band.     As with any '80s-inspired record,  Bodies  leans heavily on synths. AFI use them well when it comes to spacey atmospheres and dark ambience, but they get into trouble when they put the keyboards at the forefront. On industrial-pop songs like ""Escape from Los Angeles"" and ""Death of the Party,"" they're very present, but they don't do much to actually make the songs better. With slow-burners ""Back from the Flesh"" and ""Tied to a Tree,"" the band goes for big echoes and palpable tension, but they're so tedious that the only strain is on one's patience.     With  Crash Love , AFI leaned into their pop instincts. With  Burials , they went for arena rock. With  The Blood Album , they channelled the sounds of their heyday. That last record was far from exceptional, but it was nice to hear them doing some of the things that made their major-label breakthrough  Sing the Sorrow  a cult classic. If nothing else, it sounded like AFI. But with  Bodies , they sound lost without an identity. There's barely anything that's exciting or memorable, and when it surprises, it's only in the wrong ways. The band sounds about 30 years less experienced than they are. In the corny Duran Duran worship of ""Looking Tragic,"" Havok sings this line repeatedly: ""What a total mess."" Let's leave it at that.

2021-06-14,Manus Hopkins,8,"ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS,METAL AND HARDCORE",'Aggression Continuum' Is a Bittersweet Last Hurrah for Fear Factory's Core Members,,"The question as to which band will be the ""next Metallica"" comes up every now and again in the metal world. Usually, it means which band will take up their mantle of mainstream popularity. The general consensus is that no one will. Yet, if we think about what Metallica is known for beyond their massive success, one thing has to be the inter-band drama that was embarrassingly immortalized in the 2004 documentary,  Some Kind of Monster . If there's any other metal band that can out-drama Metallica, it's  Fear Factory .     The industrial metal pioneers' new album follows what has seemed like an eternity of messy legal infighting between past and present members of the group over the rights to the Fear Factory name. At one point, it seemed like frontman Burton C. Bell and guitarist Dino Cazares would emerge with a victorious new record and the Fear Factory machine would receive a massive upgrade, coming back more efficient than ever. But that desperate hope was shattered last fall when Bell left the group and subsequently vilified Cazares in the media.     Aggression Continuum  still features Bell's vocals, which proves to be one the best things about it. But the record raises some big questions: mainly, can the music be separated from the drama, or will it be overshadowed? This is tricky to answer. It's a safe bet that nearly everyone who listens to the record will have some idea as to what's been going on with the band. Through its 10 blistering tracks,  Aggression Continuum  struggles at maximum capacity to outweigh the real-life strife and stand on its own as an album.    Furious vocal performances, razor-sharp guitar licks and bludgeoning drums — and what a good thing it is that this one has real drums — all show up in abundance on  Aggression Continuum . Classic lineup or not, there's no doubt this is Fear Factory at full efficiency, from the  Terminator -esque spoken word intro of opening track ""Recode"" to the dystopian climax of aptly-titled closer ""End of Line.""    No soul is spared by the robotic synchronicity with which the guitars and drums run, and it's clear throughout this apocalyptic wasteland of an album to see why Fear Factory has had a lasting influence on some of the most exciting current up-and-comers in heavy music. Lead singles ""Disruptor"" and ""Fuel Injected Suicide Machine"" have some of the biggest choruses of the band's career, and there's not a track that isn't rife with massive riffage. There are robotic electronic elements aplenty, as well as touches of synths and strings that enhance the songs — but, truthfully, it's the chemistry between Bell and Cazares that makes  Aggression Continuum  the unstoppable killing machine that it is.     This being said, the other big question is whether or not Fear Factory will keep the attention of fans past this record. It's already obvious that things will never be the same without Bell's vocals and presence. Whether the band is able to continue or not,  Aggression Continuum  definitively marks the end of an era for Fear Factory. It may not be the triumphant return fans had hoped for, but it's not a desperate gasp for one last breath either. It's somewhere in between — a bittersweet last hurrah.  Demanufacture  from 1995 will always be the rusted jewel in Fear Factory's scrap metal crown, but  Aggression Continuum  is a worthy final program before an inevitable systems reboot.

2021-06-14,Megan LaPierre,7,"EP,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Half Moon Run Strip Down Their Process While Remaining as Grandiose as Ever on 'Inwards & Onwards',,"As the ancient proverb goes, the coolest thing a group of dudes can do is harmonize.  Half Moon Run  (Conner Molander, Dylan Phillips and Devon Portielje) are known for their meticulously-crafted maximalist arrangements — vocal and otherwise. The Montreal-based band of multi-instrumentalists' second pandemic EP,  Inwards & Onwards , bookends 2020's  Seasons of Change .    It draws its title from a subverted cliché in the earlier EP's title track: ""Onwards and upwards / Gonna find me a better daze."" That prior collection's parting promise reflected the introspective journey the band have now embarked on: they've realized in isolation that one must go in before being able to go on, and both of these precede the upwards trajectory.    This latest EP is borne of the ruminative first step in that process. As Half Moon Run's first release since  Isaac Symonds decided to leave the group last year , it feels like a back-to-basics reset.  Inwards & Onwards  sees the trio shift their grandiose orchestral ambitions towards recording, engineering, producing and mixing the project themselves for the first time in their Mile End jam space.    Percussive lead single ""How Come My Body"" is an opening statement rather than a question, starting and ending acoustically as the band conjugate various punctuations for its brief two minutes and 18 seconds. It's the mahogany ribcage of a beautiful stringed instrument groaning with changes in temperature — existential growing pains necessarily embodied.    ""On And On"" is the most quintessentially Half Moon Run track — an expansive universe shimmering with possibility. ""I listen to growin' / Ebbin' and flowin,'"" Phillips sings with the weightlessness of a downy dandelion swaying in the breeze, ""Nothin' like knowin' the sun has shone."" This nostalgically captures the ethos of the whole project: the quick-quick-slow salsa rhythm of the way time changes us, and the non-linear way these changes are revealed.    The tongue-in-cheek ""Fxgiving"" recalls 2019's insatiably-catchy ""Jello on My Mind"" (from their last LP,  A Blemish in the Great Light ) with its macabre humour. It's all the better considering the irony of how deeply the band members do seem to care about their craft. That tension is laid bare in the track's rhythmic pacing, ascending and descending a modal staircase.    With its folksy harmonica, ""Nosebleeds"" is begging for a campfire and/or a sea of waving phone flashlights. ""It's True"" shouts into the void, packing the most roaring crescendo of the bunch, while ""Tiny"" is a billowing farewell that vows to ""keep on keeping on"" with a resolved shrug. It's all we can do.     Seasons of Change  waxed and waned more dynamically with higher highs and lower lows, while this EP feels a bit more levelled out with lethargy. There are more narrative arcs in the individual songs than in the collection at large: a theme-and-variations on quarantine self-reflection.    Some attempts to be profound can veer off into vague platitudes — under the water but still too near the surface to know its real depth. But that meditative hum has a tendency to turn into epiphany when we least expect it. Here, the biggest lesson for and about Half Moon Run becomes the knowledge that they don't need outside help to engineer their signature lush soundscapes. Their internal world is sprawling and this project proves their aptitude to capture it in-progress.     Inwards & Onwards  boldly walks the walk of its title's first half. Having spoken it into existence, we can look forward to seeing where they take the ""onwards,"" while holding onto hope that the upwards ascent will soon follow.

2021-06-15,Luke Fox,7,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",'Culture III' Ends Migos' Trilogy with More of the Same,,"Georgia's three-headed monster of triple-time flows (and more showy ice than those girls from  Frozen ) delayed the long-awaited third and final installment of their  Culture  trilogy because each member wanted to drop a solo project and because a worldwide pandemic would chuck a wrench in the splashy rollout for a project destined to bang summer parties and rolled-windows cruises. At last,  Migos '  Culture III  is finally here, and it supplies everything fans would want and expect from the bando bandits-gone-glittery mainstream. For better or worse.      Quavo ,  Offset  and  Takeoff  start things off with a wonderful curveball in opener ""Avalanche."" The decidedly un-trap and entirely hook-free opener samples the Temptations' 1972 hit ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone,"" a nod to single-mother upbringings and the size of the rocks now weighing down their wrists and necks. It's a grown-ass banger that has  already reaped praise from Jay-Z . The lurching ""Having Our Way"" is dominated by another quotable verse by  Drake , who's basically the unofficial fourth Migo at this point.     But by the time the third track, ""Straightenin,"" hits, we are plunged into familiar territory: AutoTuned rhymes about cars, jewels, and cocaine bricks; hypnotic, repetitive choruses; quirky onomatopoeia adlibs; and those  ""weird little flute""  flourishes that  Saturday Night Live  parodied this season. ""Jane"" is another vintage Migos selection. Its bare-bones hook (""She want a Birkin / I told her, 'Work it'"" repeated eight times) boils male-female relationships down to a sex-for-gifts exchange, but it's also catchy as hell in a ""Walk It Talk It"" way.     The Migos formula works, to be sure. But it's those occasional reaches outside the tried and true — be it beats or collaborators — that make for a more compelling listen, even if they don't always smack the mark. The staccato flows of ""Malibu,"" featuring Chicago's Polo G, work wonders atop producer Pooh Beatz, horn punches. The skillful arrogance of  Murda Beatz  street track ""Modern Day"" bristles with three of the most urgent individual verses on the project. And ""Picasso,"" featuring a lengthy chorus by stadium tourmate  Future , reminisces on the trio's risky teenagehood.     Trouble is,  Culture III  suffers from the same issue (albeit to a lesser degree) that plagued 2018's bloated double-disc  Culture II . Clocking in at 75 minutes and 19 tracks, the album is simply too dang long.  Justin Bieber  duet ""What You See"" is a valiant try but ultimately forgettable, and filler like ""Why Not,"" ""Handle My Business"" and ""Birthday"" could've been chopped to save the sagging second half.     Those still nodding their noggins over an hour into the experience will be rewarded with ""Light It Up"" and its simmering a Brooklyn-style drill beat composed by 808Melo. The soundbed is tailormade for a posthumous cameo from  Pop Smoke , and Migos adapt well. Even better is closing track ""Need It,"" featuring  YoungBoy Never Broke Again . Sure, the single — which cribs 50 Cent's ""Get in My Car"" — has been kicking around radio for months, but it ends the album on a high note. It's a reminder that eight years after ""Versace"" put Migos on the radar, the trio still knows how to cook up a summertime banger.

But on this nine-track, 28-minute mini-album (which may or may not count as the follow-up to their strong 2016 debut,  Mykki ), Blanco makes such a strong and innovative proclamation that it may go down as the rapper's defining statement — no matter the format.    Starting with the bustling '70s groove of second track ""Free Ride,"" co-produced by  Hudson Mohawke ,  Broken Hearts and Beauty Sleep  sets off on a nearly non-stop run of mugging raps, often hilarious lyrics and truly great backing vocals spearheaded by Mykal Kilgore, Leah King and L1ZY. ""Free Ride"" may be one of the best gay club disco anthems this side of 1976, paired with gospel-style backing vocals and Blanco's vivid storytelling raps. ""It's Not My Choice,"" a sleek and moody duet with  Blood Orange , is the clear standout here thanks to major contributions from the British musician (who co-produced and programmed the track), adding a second level of texture thanks to his glossy cello and keyboards.    ""Love Me"" contributes to the ultramodern M.O. due to some brilliant cascading co-production by Daniel Fisher (a.k.a.  Physical Therapy ) alongside downtempo vocals from  Jamila Woods  and Blanco's brother, Jay Cue. NYC house musician  FaltyDL , who worked on all nine songs, knows how to make his production — often cinematic, high tech and moody — work with Blanco's nimble party anthems, best demonstrated by the hilarious minute-long ""Fuck Your Choices"".    But because this is a Mykki Blanco release, there's bound to be some patchy spots, as the musician is known for taking artistic chances. The opening track, ""Trust a Little Bit (God Colony Version),"" is an LL Cool J-style throwback slow jam that unfortunately never finds its footing. ""Want from Me"" is a faux-lounge number that falls flat due to an unconvincing chorus from Portuguese singer and actor Bruno Ribeiro. But even these low points stay afloat due to some truly inventive and interesting production from FaltyDL.

2021-06-17,Jordan Currie,7,"R&B,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Emanuel's 'ALT THERAPY' Is an R&B Journey Through Healing,,"Soothing, euphoric and completely therapeutic,  Emanuel 's debut album  ALT THERAPY  is appropriately titled and even more true in sound. The London, ON-born, Toronto-based singer's two prior  ALT THERAPY  EPs, featuring material that would eventually end up on the full-length, explored different facets of tumult and healing that set the table for  ALT THERAPY . Through the power of Emanuel's tender vocals and silky R&B sounds, the record takes listeners on a journey through yearning, romance and liberation from past pain.    For a large portion of the project, Emanuel is in the midst of the lavender haze — utterly lovesick and seemingly in awe of the subject of his desire. On the opener ""Need You,"" lush strings intertwine with Emanuel's smooth-as-butter riffs as he sings ""I feel I need you to be"" as though his object's affection and mere presence is like oxygen to him. On ""I Been,"" the singer professes that he'd do anything for his lover on top of luxurious guitars and descending harmonies.    It's clear that love in its many forms is a massive motivator to Emanuel on this record, and it's the relationships and intimacy he shares with someone he loves that play an undeniable factor in his own healing process. The spiritual piano chords on ""Thought It'd Be Easy"" are reminiscent of church organs and give off a vibe similar to a Miguel song as Emanuel thinks of his person even when he is with someone else.    Though mostly keeping a consistently misty and enchanting tone, the record doesn't shy away from heavier concepts and sounds. ""Addiction"" grapples with being on a synthetic high and the messy crash back down to Earth afterward, where using anything to distract oneself from anxiety is comforting but fleeting. ""Medicine"" is the most energetic song on the album, a club banger with deep, dark beats that reverberates in the listener's mind.    While  ALT THERAPY  meanders occasionally, Emanuel delivers a fully realized sound. Even though he may falter and experience disillusionment in his life, he always comes back to healing in the end.

2021-06-17,Aly Laube,9,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Backxwash Makes Rage Beautiful on 'I Lie Here Buried with My Rings and My Dresses',,"Following her  Polaris Music Prize-winning  2020 album,  God Has Nothing to Do with This Leave Him Out of It ,  Backxwash  has delivered a follow-up seething with deep rage and pain. Ashanti Mutinta's hard, industrial production is a deliciously heavy backdrop to her honest, intimate bars on  I Lie Here Buried with My Rings and My Dresses , which retains its intensity from start to finish.    The full-length starts off with excruciating catharsis. Ada Rook, formerly of  Black Dresses , lends her chilling scream to title track  ""I Lie Here Buried with My Rings and My Dresses,""  another success from a songwriting duo that have already proven to make a good team (as heard on ""Spells"" from  God Has Nothing to Do with This) .    Music like Backxwash's sounds like a rebellion against the established social and stylistic norms because that's exactly what it is. Mutinta raps about substance use, mental illness, gender identity, sexuality and more subjects rarely heard in such widely celebrated music. But she's out here saying it, wearing her heart on her sleeve in a world and music industry that has historically ignored people like her.    That's why it matters that Backxwash's lyrics and sound are dark and threatening, always in synergy with one another. That's what listeners have come to expect from Mutinta's writing: it's always beautifully curated, stylistically consistent, poignant, and — above all — refreshingly real. She shows listeners how it feels to walk through her world, and the space she creates on these 10 tracks is oozes fear and anxiety, but miraculously uplifts through pure emotion and authenticity.    Samples from civil rights activist Angela Davis and homophobic Christian preachers (on ""In Thy Holy Name,"" no less) emphasize all elements of Mutinta's identity, as she grapples with her history as a trans woman who was raised in a heavily religious environment in Zambia before moving to Canada as a teenager.    The version of God addressed through Backxwash tracks is malevolent, punitive and oppressive, more of a representation of white cisheteronormative patriarchy and colonial Judeo-Christian systems than of any sort of reverent spirituality. If there is anything revered through her lyrics, it's the strength of demons and devils who rally and rage against being controlled by these systems — possibly a way for Mutinta to channel a sense of empowerment. It makes sense, then, that her beats and words are both beautiful and evil, alluring listeners with their eerie melodies and grating whirrs and screams.     God Has Nothing to Do with This  is a tough release to follow, but  I Lie Here  makes it clear that Backxwash is still on her ascent. She has brought back the best parts of nu metal and repackaged it in the coolest and most operatic way possible.    It feels like Mutinta wrote this record while going through a year of intense self-reflection, suffering and realization. That anguish lives on the record, interpreted through crunchy snares, blown-out bass and scratchy screams that simulate the feeling of being emotionally overwhelmed. It creates the feeling of being so enraged you're exhausted, of being so tiny you're afraid, of being powerless against the structures that hurt you. Songs open with sirens, chimes, and wailing to create a sense of foreboding that never goes away.     I Lie Here  asks more questions than it can answer, but the record retains a narrative arc that shows how Backxwash continues to grow, change and challenge the world around her. A processing of powerlessness and reclaiming of that power through self-expression,  I Lie Here  presents audiences with a less restrained version of Mutinta's songwriting and vocal delivery. It's an absolute gift to industrial hardcore, hip-hop and metal — somehow succeeding in all three genres at the same time while delivering lyrical and sonic gems along the way.

2021-06-17,Tom Piekarski,8,"POP AND ROCK,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Dean Blunt Returns to Avant-Pop Directness on 'BLACK METAL 2',,"About halfway through  BLACK METAL 2 , some 30 seconds into ""SEMTEX,"" Dean Blunt cranks up the delay on a single vocal line. The effect situates the listener, eschewing the cunning so often expected from the genre-shifting Blunt. There is no obfuscation here — when Blunt sings, ""Here we are, back on the guitar,"" we are being told exactly what we're getting on  BLACK METAL 2 . On the album, Blunt and frequent guest vocalist Joanne Robertson float above the steady current of an avant-pop ensemble, leaning harder than ever into the ""singer-songwriter"" potential that lurked in the shadows of past Dean Blunt offerings.    In various groups ( Hype Williams ,  Babyfather , Blue Iverson, etc.) and alone, Blunt is known for delivering a woozy blend of rock, hip-hop and electronica. But the kind of lyrical frankness and instrumental focus on display here makes it clear why  BLACK METAL 2  was conceived as a sequel. 2014's  Black Metal  was by far the most taut of Blunt's releases, the more unsettling aspects of his patchwork songs smoothed out just enough to nearly resemble pop numbers.      BLACK METAL 2  takes up that mantle of directness. Though the album coalesces around a core trio of Blunt, Robertson, and producer Giles Kwakeulati King-Ashong, key performances by a cast of London-based guitarists give  BLACK METAL 2  its main musical identity. Tracks like ""MUGU"" and ""DASH SNOW"" are propelled forward by the swagger of the guitar and bass, the performances littered with enough flourishes to suggest a degree of looseness. The approach pays off, and the combination of Blunt's trademark dissociative delivery and the band's balladry gives their collective efforts a troubadour-like quality.     The one drawback to  BLACK METAL 2 's consistency is that, unlike some of the best Blunt has to offer, this newest album hangs entirely amidst a cloud of malaise. Even with its run time of 20 minutes, this record can feel relentless in its despondency. There is no analogue to  The Redeemer 's ""Imperial Gold"" here, nothing approximating ""12"" off of Blunt and Inga Copeland's  Black Is Beautiful , no cuts that evince a sense of romantic hope or ecstatic energy found on other Blunt releases.    That said, if  BLACK METAL 2  is less Blunt-as-provocateur and more Blunt-as-storyteller, then both longtime fans and brand-new listeners owe him the opportunity to paint that morose picture in equal measure. Regardless of your familiarity with Blunt's music, you're bound to be rewarded.

2021-06-18,Stephan Boissonneault,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",'Butterfly 3000' Is the Least King Gizzard-Sounding Record of Theirs Yet,,"The first quarter of  King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard 's latest album,  Butterfly 3000 , sounds like you're looking through a technicolour kaleidoscope. Lush polyphonic melodies, swirling and whizzing by at a moment's notice, are concocted with an array of modular and analog synthesizers, and — save for the minor-keyed intro on the fourth track ""Blue Morpho"" — there is no real sonic tension. The universe sounds bright and jubilant—a huge departure from the frenetic fuzz energy on past King Gizzard works.     Butterfly 3000  is the Australian experimental psych unit's second album of 2021, and 18th to date. They're clearly a group of prolific musicians with a surplus of talent who get sonically bored every year, as most of their albums delve into something new (though always psychedelic), from trippy jazz on  Sketches of Brunswick East  to the thrash metal of  Infest the Rats' Nest . But their departure here is still striking — while fuzzed-out electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and saxophone all make appearances on the album, they are quite brief, with the proceedings instead dominated by synthesizer loops.      Butterfly 3000  marks King Gizzard's most electronic work to date, sounding as if the band built songs over arpeggiated synth loops, coupled together with bleeps, bloops and lots of filtering. It returns to the band's more overarching, conceptually structured efforts as songs bleed into one another and certain melodic themes are rehashed throughout the album. And though the electronic sound is different from other King Gizzard work, the concept-heavy album structure that has become the group's signature isn't sacrificed.     Feathery vocals from lead singer Stu Mackenzie on early numbers ""Yours,"" ""Shanghai,"" and ""Dreams,"" serve as halcyon elevator music. Mackenzie's lyricism mostly comes across as stream of consciousness or enunciating a certain phrase multiple times, like ""Bye-bye, Shanghai / I've become a butterfly"" on ""Shanghai."" It's all sung in a laid back falsetto and really works for the dreamy atmosphere King Gizzard is going for. Still, Joey Walker's lyrics pack more of a punch, as on the baroque pop number ""Interior People"" with the memorable line ""Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the drywall inside my skull.""    Though King Gizzard have quickly cultivated a signature style,  Butterfly 3000  finds them uncharacteristically sounding like their peers, recalling the daydreaming synth-rock of contemporaries like Tame Impala. You could call  Butterfly 3000  the least King Gizzard album of their career — there is next-to-no distortion or guitar riff theatrics. Nevertheless, it's a refreshing departure from the psychedelic garage records the band has released in the past few years. And if fans want more of their trademark sound, based on Gizzard's release habits, they will most likely only have to wait a year at most.

2021-06-02,Jordan Currie,7,"EP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,R&B,MUSIC",'Desperate Times' Call for Mighloe's Dreamlike R&B,,"Desperate Times , the newest project by Toronto-based singer-songwriter  Mighloe , drifts into spring like a chilly breeze on a warm day, equal parts moody and refreshing and full of hushed yet controlled vocals and sounds. The seven-track EP is Mighloe's third independent release following 2018's  All About You  and 2020's  Pretty , and it cultivates her growing sound of R&B and soul. A blend of sensuality, world-weariness and ultimately hope,  Desperate Times  blooms with self-reflection, establishing Mighloe as a Canadian artist to watch out for.    An idle, almost sleepy quality blankets each track, though in a way that feels far from sluggish or apathetic. The soft and airy ""Stolen Paradise"" sets the tone and eases listeners into a dreamlike state. ""I've been floating through time for days now,"" Mighloe croons atop lush, fluid guitars, and listeners will feel as though they're right there floating with her on a lethargic summer afternoon. ""Cruel"" is reminiscent of a gentle doo-wop standard, like a song one might tipsily sing at a late-night karaoke bar.    On the single ""Don't Call Me,""  Mighloe  vents about her frustrations with people who come in and out of her life as they please; her aura is laidback and nonchalant, but her snappy vocals can't hold back the fact that she's clearly fed up with uncaring presences in her life and wishes to move on.    The EP is lounge-y and contemplative, from the eerie and ghostly echoes on title track ""Desperate Times"" to the slow drawl of ""Into the Tide."" Mighloe appears to tread through the hardships in her life drearily and with speculation, but she manages to do this without losing the charm or spark of her R&B and soulful sound.  Desperate Times  is simple yet enticing and relatable, showing Mighloe to be a versatile and honest artist.

2021-06-03,Owen Morawitz,4,"METAL AND HARDCORE,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Atreyu's 'Baptize' Has All the Lasting Impact of a Post-Energy Drink Buzz,,"In a much-publicized  2018 interview with  Rock Sound , former  Atreyu  vocalist Alex Varkatzas claimed the band ""invented metalcore,"" before going on to admit, ""that may sound cocky, but I don't care.""    While a number of metallic hardcore luminaries like Earth Crisis, Integrity and Converge might have something say about such a brazen declaration, it's of little consequence for the Atreyu of 2021.  Varkatzas was cut loose last year , and now former drummer and clean vocalist Brandon Saller has moved up to fill the frontman slot. Where 2018's  In Our Wake  was another predictable entry in  what Exclaim! called  the Orange County group's ""palatable brand of Hot Topic post-hardcore"" and triangulated pivot towards ""radio-rock fare,"" their newest LP makes this much-telegraphed transformation complete.    On  Baptize , Atreyu embrace their rightful place in the hallowed halls of homogenized arena rock without a hint of irony or self-awareness, leaning right into millennial 'woah-oh' choruses, cringey nu-metal verses, and squeaky-clean John Feldmann production utterly devoid of anything resembling grit or texture. Now, to be fair, there's nothing inherently wrong with evolution or courting mainstream appeal and, at its core, rock remains a timeless genre for very good reasons. The problem with  Baptize , however, is the innate blandness of the band's songwriting and lyricism, and how shamelessly Atreyu appear to be cribbing from their many (and arguably more successful) contemporaries.     Baptize  hits an early high note with Saller belting out the record's soaring title track. Sadly, that momentum dissipates with ""Save Us,"" a track that aims to be one of the heaviest songs Atreyu have ever written, but ends up sounding like little more than a hastily discarded Beartooth B-side. Later numbers like ""Untouchable"" and ""Oblivion"" include forgettable guest features from Jacoby Shaddix ( Papa Roach ) and Matt Heafy ( Trivium ), respectively, and are notable only for how indistinguishable the vocals and instrumentals sound from their guests' primary outfits.    This game of 'Sounds Like [Insert Band Here]' plays out across the album again and again — Avenged Sevenfold elements here, Linkin Park-isms there — without any of it feeling cohesive or distinct to Atreyu in any tangible way. Save for Saller's indomitable vocal range, ""Warrior"" and its  Travis Barker -assisted drum-line section could be the backing track to a Fall Out Boy stadium set-piece or an NFL theme song, with a baked-in sense of intentional ambiguity that feels flavourless by design. Meatier cuts like ""Underrated,"" ""Fucked Up"" and ""Catastrophe"" allow guitarists Dan Jacobs and Travis Miguel to stitch together brief moments of shred, before being washed out by everything-must-be-massive choruses that result in a serious case of sonic whiplash.    According to their PR pitch, it's best to think of Atreyu ""as a loud rock band."" Questions of desired volume aside, that's an accurate description here.  Baptize  has all the lasting impact of a post-energy drink buzz, sounding about as unique and memorable as the rumbling static from a festival side stage you passed over in favour of the headliner. It's clear Atreyu crave rebirth in the crucible of lifeless arena rock, but with a selection of tracks this dull and inoffensive, they'll probably get their wish. That may sound cocky, but I don't care.

Evan Vincent) has been steadily climbing the rungs of Toronto's dance scene for a number of years, to the point where he's now an integral part of it. His sets are an eclectic journey, full of varying styles, twists and oddball tracks that might struggle to land in anyone else's hands, but he glues it all together seamlessly. This is why you can toss him in almost anywhere: when a legendary house producer like Levon Vincent comes to town, Emissive can support him, and when an atypical, impossible-to-classify act like Actress swings by, Emissive is perfectly matched to open for him, too. That kind of range is rare, but he's got it, and isn't afraid to use it.    Some might recognize Emissive from his other project,  Active Surplus , which is a collaboration with Ian Syrett. Together, they've seen some love from Vancouver label Pacific Rhythm, which released their  self-titled EP  in 2020; Active Surplus were also a highlight of the label's recent compilation  Rhythms of the Pacific Volume 4.    Now, for a solo venture, Emissive has returned to Pacific Rhythm, and, wouldn't you know it, this EP is absolute fun-on-the-bun too. He certainly has a knack for making incredibly colourful music without ever tumbling into the realm of sickly sweet. ""Star Mappers,"" for instance, opens with some beautiful shuffling synths that then get flanked by sounds that wouldn't sound out of place in  Sonic the Hedgehog  and a bassline that's reminiscent of the Tuss. That sounds ridiculous on paper, but damn if it doesn't come together magically. Then the pulsing ambient haze of ""Sidewalk Jam"" immediately draws you in before that funky bass takes you on a tour of the unique planetarium that Emissive has built for himself.    It's not an entirely floaty record either. ""Simple Harmonic Motion"" offers a more standard four-to-floor rhythm, but it's by no means dark techno or anything. Emissive always seems ready to slip in some warm keys just when you need them.    Of the EP, Vincent has said that he wanted it to be ""less thinking, more feeling"" — but ""less thinking, more beaming"" or ""less thinking, more dreaming"" would work just as well. You could easily play any of these in the club, but then again, you could play them in the shower too; they're that malleable.

2021-06-03,Daniel Sylvester,6,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC",Liz Phair's 'Soberish' Is Complete Indie Pop Chaos,,"Although  Liz Phair  preceded her latest LP with three of indie rock's most-maligned albums, the Chicago artist has afforded herself so much early-career goodwill that listeners will still tune in to  Soberish , her seventh record and first in over a decade.    But it's Phair's level of undying buoyancy that makes  Soberish  such a divided listen. Produced by Brad Wood — who recorded her critically-acclaimed debut,  Exile in Guyville , and beloved follow-up,  Whip-Smart  — Phair's latest LP could be looked at as a nod to her past and an attempt to recapture some of the early magic that defined her career. But as songs like the saccharine soft rock crooner ""The Game"" and the personality-drenched pop ode ""Ba Ba Ba"" prove, Phair is much too stubborn to recreate her glory days wholesale.    Unfortunately, much of this 13-track LP stands as complete indie pop chaos, as Phair and Wood go into overkill mode, injecting far too many ideas into songs that show major potential at their root. Album opener ""Spanish Doors"" takes strong verses and a driving rhythm and drenches it with electronic beats, vocal effects, and layered chorus — ostensibly turning it into a muddled mess. Melodic and fun early single ""Good Side"" works because Phair allows the song's chorus to stay simple and largely genuine.    Despite numbers like the wonderfully moody electronic ballad ""In There"" and the vulnerable acoustic confession ""Sheridan Road,"" so much of the album simply clashes with itself. Phair's refusal to trust her instincts often results in goofy Weezer-esque tracks like the lyrically bereft ""Hey Lou"" and the embarrassing ""Bad Kitty,"" a song about her cat that comes off so juvenile and slothful that it wouldn't feel out of place on her 2010 disaster,  Funstyle .    But as the album enters its second half, where Phair seems to bury tracks she deems ""not single-worthy,"" there's actually much to like. ""Soul Sucker"" is an electric piano groove that comes off incredibly memorable, while ""Dosage"" finds her delivering a responsive ballad overtop of a stripped-down bed of cello and sparse beats.    Phair is at her best when she confidently picks a lane.  Soberish  is uneven because of her indecision, but it's still her best album since 1998's  Whitechocolatespaceegg . And this is precisely why her most optimistic fans will eat it right up.

His debut album,  Kinda Blue Too , tells quirky stories of wanting friends and to feel loved while the inevitable end of the world nears.    Not to ignore his visual side, each song comes with an accompanying 16mm film clip for each song in a manner similar to Andy Warhol's  Screen Tests  featuring different subjects in a variety of environments. From a small bearded man dancing down the street on ""white shoe dance"" to a pink-haired tattooed fella riding out of a car's sunroof on ""daddy,"" Faist paints 10 different pictures of these characters that he has met throughout the city. He nods to Toronto faves like Kensington Market and Dufferin Mall in a discreet and playful manner.    Faist does not take himself — or life itself, for that matter — too seriously.  Kinda Blue Too  comes with no real structure and feels very homemade, fulfilling its garage-rock premise. Each track is comprised of simple chords and colourful lyrics. Faist pokes fun and proclaims that ""love ain't true"" on ""r u my girl?"" before later stating ""I want love for everyone"" on ""baby, how do i feel?"" in his endearingly reverbed, twangy voice.    He makes room for vulnerability on the album's title track, when the antics slow down and he admits that the world is a scary and beautiful place all at the same time. But it's not serious for too long — Faist turns poetry back into chaos right on cue for the second half of the album, filled with dusty guitars and yowling vocals. He uses dark humour to cover up what he is really thinking about, like on ""color in the streets"" when he proposes that ""Maybe we all just need to lose our minds."" It come full circle at the end of the album for tender closer ""kinda blue ii,"" a sequel to the title track. The video — the only one featuring Faist — finds him standing alone in a field, singing to himself, emphasizing his desire for connection.    There's no filler or fluff. In and out, short and sweet, capping off the whole record at a mere 28 minutes. It's about sending strangers scribbled letters in the mail inviting them over for dinner, or being obnoxiously loud at night with your friends.

Sure, those re-released re-releases have some gems hidden amongst the deep cuts and alternate takes, but largely you're playing the role of prospector, sifting through mud for a hint of gold. Halifax's  Cluttered  go against this grain — their newest EP,  Accidents,  doesn't waste a second.    The band came together in 2020, releasing an EP for that year's  DEMO FEST . That self-titled introduction demonstrated a cohesion that shines through an inherent roughness. Now, for the follow-up, Cluttered have rounded out their lineup and cleaned up the splintered edges expected on a demo, exceeding the potential shown on their debut.     Accidents ' four songs may only span 10 minutes, but that quickly becomes half-an-hour as you're almost guaranteed to play it on repeat. The band are tight and laser-focused, knowing exactly the sound they want and effortlessly creating it. It's the work of a band who have been rocking their way through Halifax's impressively productive punk scene for a decade, and are now reaping the rewards of their experiences. The band's core members — Matty Grace (Future Girls,  Weekend Dads ), Becca Dalley ( Designosaur ) and Dylan Mombourquette (Jabber, Crunchcoat) — read like a who's who of the scene. From Designosaur's angular riffs to Weekend Dad's relentless beat, you can hear a sonic résumé's worth of influence weaved through every track.    Yet, the result is still fresh. With pounding drums, a distortion that could peel paint off the walls and Grace's trademark snarl,  Accidents  is a blistering new take on the classic sounds of the Ergs! and Jawbreaker. It sits solidly in punk's grey area: too catchy to be hardcore but too heavy to be pop-punk. It's an area Grace and company have thrived in for years, and the comfort level shows.    Perhaps the most exciting moment comes with the final song, ""The Toll."" With a mid-tempo beginning that eventually explodes into an anthem, an earworm of a melody and relatable lyrics, it has all the ingredients of a great punk song, elevated further by the punk chops of guest star Cassia Hardy of Edmonton's  Wares .    Cluttered have done something easy in theory but difficult to pull off: make a punk record that honours its influences but sounds new.  Accidents ' four songs shine like 24-karat gold.

That band did pass shortly thereafter, but Thorburn's kept on going, dark humour intact. He's collaborated in various bands — Reefer,  Mister Heavenly ,  Human Highway , solo as  Nick Diamonds  — scored movies (2017's  Ingrid Goes West ) and podcasts ( Serial ), and even published a graphic novel,  Penguins .

Maybe it's the freedom to return out of inspiration rather than obligation, but the time away seems to have put a bounce in Thorburn's step:  Islomania  leans into its rhythms, while producers Chris Coady (Beach House, Future Islands) and Patrick Ford (Tanlines, !!!) help give it shape and scale. The result is the danciest version of Islands to date.    The lush, tropical longing of opener ""Islomania"" gives way to a pervasive pop groove in ""(We Like To) Do It With the Lights On"", one of the most unabashedly fun songs Thorburn has penned to date. ""Carpenter"" charges a simple, satisfying bassline through a series of what if scenarios, while ""Natural Law Party"" follows its low-end's lead as Thorburn offers: ""I am just a melody / you set my body free"".    The mood isn't always balmy: ""A Passionate Age"" packs lines like ""Put my heart away / flow, flow my tears again"" above its rhythm. Album highlight ""Never Let You Down"" cycles through doubts (""I was wrong to darken your door / Do I belong in these open arms anymore?"") and reassurances (""When it feels like the dream's over / I will move closer"") with cinematic urgency. But even  Islomania 's bleaker moments kinda bounce, refracting their darker sentiments in compelling ways. And in that,  Islomania  proves a lively, welcome return.

2021-06-08,Daniel Sylvester,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Sleater-Kinney Succeed in People-Pleasing on 'Path of Wellness',,"When  Sleater-Kinney  joined forces with St. Vincent to create their sleek, heavily stylized  The Center Won't Hold , feathers were promptly ruffled throughout the indie rock world. Longtime fans expressed their disappointment in the band's new direction, longtime drummer Janet Weiss  departed the band in response , and the album proved to be significantly less popular than 2015's   No Cities to Love   (according to Billboard charts and streaming services). But  critics had a completely different take on the 2019 record , recognizing the well-crafted and sharply-written songs found at the LP's core.    Their first release recoded as a duo in the band's 26-year career (and first without Weiss since 1996's  Call the Doctor ),  Path of Wellness , feels like it's been crafted to allow all camps to meet squarely in the middle. Sleater-Kinney's latest stands as the band's most amiable and good-natured release, liberally blending layered keyboards and forward-pounding beats (as demonstrated on the Tune-Yards-esque title track) with anthemic vocals and crunchy guitars (featured most prominently on the ever-building ""Favorite Neighbor"").    After a few listens, it becomes clear that  Path of Wellness  works best when viewed in the scope as being the inverse of its predecessor.  The Center Won't Hold  featured a strong set of songs hampered by starchy production, while this new album's diverse, adventurous and sturdy structures help enhance a collection of songs that could have otherwise sounded limp and inconspicuous.    As the first wholly self-produced Sleater-Kinney record, beefy tracks like ""High in the Grass"" and ""Method"" would have benefitted from a third-party in the studio to help them tighten up their slightly meandering melodies. But, as recorded with a number of Portland musicians (along with  powerhouse Freezing Cold drummer, Angie Boylan )  Path of Wellness  is really all about where the duo take their songs rather than where they start: ""Worry with You"" is incredibly funky, making for Sleater-Kinney's most danceable song to date; ""Shadow Town"" features an excellent pulsating guitar line that goes perfectly in tandem with the duo's sharp and cutting verses; and ""Down the Line"" is a complete classic rock banger, melding Deep Purple-nodding noodling with a jubilant chorus that slightly borrows from Led Zeppelin's 1973 hit ""Dancing Days.""    Combining the uncontaminated brawn of 2005's  The Woods  with the hip indie sensibilities of their early LPs, Sleater-Kinney have finally relieved their all-encompassing crowd-pleaser with the sonically pleasing  Path of Wellness.

2021-06-08,Kyle Mullin,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",TONA's Experiments Pay Off on 'Good Energy',,"Few rappers are better at getting listeners to chant along than  TONA . ""Closing Sermon,"" from the Toronto MC's new album  Good Energy , boasts a call and response between him and what sounds like a formidably sized crew that's self-assured enough to leave any listener pumping their fist. ""Low"" is even better in that regard, thanks to its sampled ""heys!"" (from an even bigger sounding squad), sports-montage keys, sprinter's pulse-evoking percussion, and bars from TONA that are as heart-stopping as they are thought-provoking.    Both tracks harken back to some of the most galvanizing moments from his tragically underrated 2016 LP,  The Ivy League . And like that prior release,  Good Energy  is also laudably conscious, from TONA's nimble rhymes about the virtues of staying indie and circumventing shark-suited execs on ""Closing Sermon,"" to his gut-punch lyrics about ""minorities dying"" over the mummering minimalist horn sample on ""Ways."" Even more compelling is ""N Words,"" which finds TONA rapping about not merely re-appropriating but also abolishing and reconstructing that hateful slur. He's fittingly backed up on that track by drums that shuffle like Muhammad Ali at his most fleet-footed.     Indeed, TONA's rhymes fit like a fist in the boxing mitt that is  Good Energy 's production. TONA has  the Kount  in his corner, the  Madlib- and Noname-approved Toronto beatmaker  who produces  Good Energy  from front to back. That's not only impressive because the new album amounts to a staggeringly long 18 tracks — the Kount will also floor listeners with the leanly soulful instrumentals that are TONA's sweet spot, while also offering the adventurous MC a number of eclectic forays.    That last point is especially important, because it allows TONA to finally get out of his comfort zone with great success. While  The Ivy League  was an air-tight indie rap record that left backpack diehards fawning, it wasn't as experimental as follow-ups  BLACK MIRROR  (2018) or  July 26th  (2020). And thankfully, his batting average is far higher on  Good Energy  than the commendable pop-inclined big swings he too often missed on those prior pair of releases.    Take, for instance,  Good Energy  highlight ""Nobody's Perfect."" On it, TONA is backed up by a G-funk-esque bass sample from the Kount and brassy crooning from Travis Knight; for a couple of endearing lines, the rapper switches his typical Roc-A-Fella flow to a deeper, mellow register a la Biggie Smalls. ""Ways,"" meanwhile, finds TONA occupying an entirely new pitch, nimbly following in DMX's ""Damien"" footsteps (in terms of technique, not content). Then there's ""Genesis,"" on which TONA cranks his usual steady tempo up to a breakneck speed. He also — on the pop-refined, R&B-leaning ""Vibes"" — hits sudden high notes that screech like a speeding car's tires, before flowing smoother than a BMW careening on a Sunday highway drive.    By both playing to his strengths and finally hitting his more experimental marks,  Good Energy  one-ups TONA's already-impressive, decade-and-a-half-long career with his best effort yet.

2021-06-09,Louis Pavlakos,8,"REVIEWS,R&B,EP,ALBUM,MUSIC",Mereba Perseveres Through Difficult Times on 'AZEB' EP,,"In George Miller's classic film  Mad Max , Australia's dystopian society has just begun. The roads are still intact but society is visibly crumbling. The country's authority has seemingly been overrun by motorbike gangs and all signs of government are gone. Mereba's latest EP,  AZEB , reflects the post-apocalyptic society of the  Mad Max  series but offers a quieter and more distraught point of view of a world that's falling apart in real time.    Though  AZEB  isn't as violent or outwardly angry as any of the  Mad Max  films, Mereba wastes no time pointing out humanity's constant conflicts — her first words on opener ""Aye"" is ""Aye, aye, there's a war every day,"" while on second track ""Rider,"" she sings, ""The world feels like a war / Tell me what living's for."" (In the latter's music video, Mereba and a lover are seen dancing on a canvas of nothingness and empty deserts, further evoking the  Mad Max  parallels.)    The production on the seven tracks is sparse and minimalistic. The quietness of the EP's soundscape reflects Mereba's sombre lyrics, especially on standout ""News Come,"" where she hopes for Black liberation (""Freedom for my people is urgent / And you know we deserve it / Tell me, who are you servin'?"") and decries online slacktivism (""News come, news go / Still, we fight when the screen's closed""). Though it might be hard to envision better days, Mereba succeeds at telling her story in a vulnerable and poetic way, helped especially by simple, acoustic guitar-led tracks that emphasize her angelic voice and thoughtful lyrics.     The entire EP sees the 30-year-old singer clinging onto her love as a form of shelter from the violent, disturbed world that's shown on the news and online every day. On ""Beretta,"" the project's most uplifting track, Mereba's at her most optimistic. On the chorus, she seems unconcerned with the world and is only focused on being with the one she loves (""It's you and me together / Baby boy, let's stick up the world for this cheddar""). This is contrasted by the next track, ""Another Kin,"" where she explores the trauma and grief of anti-Black violence. Despite its short length, it's  AZEB 's heaviest moment with its central lyric, ""Another kin killed today / Another stone thrown today.""     AZEB  is an EP about perseverance in a time where everything feels bleak and helpless. Even when Mereba is at her most optimistic, like on ""Beretta"" and closing track ""My Moon,"" the darkness of the world isn't far away. Mereba's fight is not ending anytime soon, but singing about her life can help soothe the soul, at least a little bit.

The Toronto-based R&B singer invites the listener in on her mental process, painting every stage of the picture of love lost while dreaming for the day she is free of burden by a past lover. Liza's clear songwriting make the nuances of her varying emotions easy to identify with.    Liza's 2017 EP,  February 29 ,  showcased romantic desires far less set in stone, like on ""Let You Know What,"" which found her character looking for a lover to fill a void in her heart. On  DONE IS DONE , her lyrics are more decisive, showing off authoritative decision-making that acknowledges her sadness while unequivocally moving on from something she believes is no longer worth fighting to keep.      ""ROLLA"" follows February 29 track ""Ride,"" furthering Liza's tried-and-true analogy of a relationship as moments experienced in motion, like a rollercoaster or emotionally charged car ride. The sound of an engine revving kicks off interlude ""…TILL THE WHEELS FALL OFF,"" where radio tuning leads into a car alarm, as if Liza is going to take off with the remnants of this emotional exchange until she no longer can.    Elsewhere on the EP, standout ""LANSDOWNE"" plays like a sweet serenade to an old love, serving as the defining moment in the journey of heartbreak where one finally surrenders to reality instead of hoping for a return of what can no longer be. Closing tracks ""MEMORIZE FEELINGS"" and ""DONE IS DONE"" find Liza moving on and embracing new romantic possibilities.    The singer/songwriter hones her sultry sound on  DONE IS DONE , and asserts her ability to exercise her agency as a lover without the limiting expectations and disappointing dynamics of past relationships. Liza sets the stage for her next project, whether an EP or album, as she vividly expresses her vulnerability and sets a sturdy foundation for her next story.  (Independent)                           REVIEWS   R&B   EP   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Liza",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/liza_done_is_done_ep_album_review
2021-05-31,Tom Beedham,8,"AMBIENT,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",YlangYlang's New EP Deconstructs the 'Cycles & Decay' of Ambient Music,,"Cycles and decay are everywhere in ambient music. As characteristic properties, they effectively speak to the minimalist, generative nature of the genre, conjuring images of overlapping tape loops and delay pedal interfaces. They are so normal place they're as disregarded as they are fawned over with delight — a dynamic Brian Eno himself dubbed ""as ignorable as it is interesting"" when codifying the genre.    Placing these implements front and centre in the title of her latest  YlangYlang  record,  Cycles & Decay , Catherine Debard has something to say about the genre itself. Drifting in the new age pop wake of her 2020 offering  Interplay , which also concerned itself with themes of interpersonal entanglement, this new EP is also a project in scrutinizing the unexpected outcome of dialectical existence.     Isolated at home, Debard attempted to re-grow leaves from the cores of vegetables and took note of the fungal activity that followed. Instead of discarding the projects, she continued observing the mutations. On a very basic level, the perceived decay was simply a causal reaction — an attempt to persist in a given set of shifted environmental conditions — and Debard connected its stimulation to psycho-social behaviour.     Debard also began applying the relational systems she was witnessing in nature to her compositions as a generational device, but she didn't really have to. The pandemic was providing its own case studies: reduced human activity meant the floors of the Venetian canals were clearing up, wildlife was suddenly presenting itself in abandoned parts of usually busy cities, and the immuno-compromised lives disproportionately represented amongst the climbing COVID-19 death toll were suddenly erased by eco-fascists declaring ""nature is healing.""    Debard traces early work on cassette loops that precipitated EP opener ""Cedar St."" back to 2019 when reports were coming in about the Amazon rainforest wildfires, but  Cycles & Decay  is as much a critique of those able to embrace those narratives as it is the conditions that inspire them; unprecedented conditions provoke radical reactions, and extended periods of 'stagnation' key you into red flags and patterns that were hidden in plain sight.    Weaving in contributions from  Interplay  contributors Evelyn Charlotte Joe (acoustic guitar, effects, upright bass, toy piano) and Connor Bennett (saxophone, effects) on ""Penumbra"" and ""Green, Blue,"" extended sax notes accompany amorphous clouds of dark textural matter, acoustic guitar notes consumed by digital squelches nearly as fast as they're conjured into existence.     As the EP progresses, the dialectic sounds increasingly cooperative and social — even game-like, but there's a world of meaning in every interaction. The breadth and levels of these ideas could easily fill an album, but Debard's rippling EP delivers a more substantial and nuanced expression than most full-lengths do.

2021-06-01,Alex Hudson,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Alyson McNamara's 'Let Me Sleep' Makes for a Peaceful Dream,,"Alyson McNamara  is a singer-songwriter whose music could loosely be described as folk rock, but it hits more like shoegaze. The Toronto artist's third album,  Let Me Sleep , is pure vibe, the kind of music that's more about mood-setting than storytelling. The album's accompanying videos have depicted scenes like  drifting through an animated ocean while sleeping on a sofa  and  a caterpillar having a bubble party  — visuals that match the sleepy, bong-ripping vibe of the tunes.    The record opens with the Neil Young-esque sway of ""After Hours,"" which marries the patient groove of ""On the Beach"" with the fuzzy licks of ""Cinnamon Girl."" McNamara has a soft and beautiful voice that's more Feist-y than feisty; she doesn't enunciate much, and most of the lyrics get lost amidst the whispered, breathy exhalations.    McNamara, who performed guitar alongside Tokyo Police Club's Dave Monks on his most recent solo tour, touches on a few folksy configurations on  Let Me Sleep : ""Waiting"" is a finger-picked acoustic ballad, and ""I'm Right Here"" and ""It's Easy"" are stripped-down piano laments. But she's best when settling into a cloudy-headed electric groove, as on the War on Drugs-in-slo-mo arpeggios of ""Shutting Down"" or the uncharacteristically sprightly ""Got All Night."" The latter song features playful lines like, ""Take the road that winds around / All the pretty shops on Dundas West / I'm just around the corner from the Laser Quest / Can't miss the house, we call it Garbage World / I know it looks scary with the tarp at the front / But I assure you it's nice in my place at the top."" It's one of the only times on  Let Me Sleep  that the lyrics stand out, providing alarmingly specific directions to what is presumably McNamara's house.    The back half of the 11-track album is loaded with ballads, which are unfailingly lovely but don't leave quite as much of an impression as the distorted electric guitars.  Let Me Sleep  appropriately enough, feels a bit like a sleep aid, and it makes for a peaceful dream.

Notorious for hiding his identity behind his native Haitian flag, arriving late to a meeting with Jay-Z and a collaboration with late masked colleague MF Doom, Hommy has squashed his beef with his label Griselda and produced a substantive project. From the artwork, to the skits and trilingual content, the album stands out aesthetically and reaffirms Mach's cultural and artistic identity.    Even if Mach-Hommy's personality is the driving force behind the album, executive producer  Westside Gunn  also makes his imprint on the project. Following a grimy set of songs, we get a taste of the creative collage this project represents on ""Folie à Deux,"" which includes Gunn's percussive presence, Keisha Plum's abstract poetry and Conductor's ethereal production. The song is held together by the directness of Mach's lyrical approach, and it is his unique set of verses that add cohesiveness to this album divergent beat selection. ""Marie"" provides a 2pac-inspired hook, which highlights a number of late-'90s rap references as Hommy hops from Haitian Creole to French and English. Standout track ""Kriminel"" sees Quebec producer Nicholas Craven provide a soulful backdrop for Hommy to drop his rapid fire flow. Craven is no stranger to the Griselda camp, having previously collaborated on Hommy's fan favorites ""Mozambique Drill"" and ""Squeaky Hinges,"" which made Hova's 2020 year end Tidal playlist.    Tha God Fahim, another Craven collaborator and prolific underground spitter, joins Hommy on ""Magnum,"" which embodies the melting-pot nature of the album and is punctuated by Westside Gunn's signature ad libs. The disparity between dark songs like ""Murder Czn"" and the uplifting ""Blockchain"" represent the breadth of Hommy's scope on this well-crafted piece of art.    Curated by Flygod's Midas touch, this album is already opening up Mach to a broader audience of fans. On  Pray for Haiti , he has successfully stayed true to his roots while offering unique yet less obtuse content. It's perfect strategy for a rapper who is benefiting from his concealed identity while shining bright for the underground and bringing a Creole flavour back to the game.

2021-06-01,Kyle Mullin,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","On 'Exodus,' DMX Finally Finds Meaning in His Suffering",,"Though  DMX  fans are still mourning the  death of the veteran rapper  in April, they will surely take solace in his excellent new posthumous album,  Exodus . Its name and themes are not only biblical but also familial, as the Yonkers rapper named his youngest son after that Old Testament book. It's the return to form Ruff Ryder diehards have been waiting for after years of diminishing returns like 2006's  Year of the Dog… Again  (the rapper's first album to not debut at No. 1 or go platinum) and 2012's  Undisputed  (on which his flow was downright arthritic).     Exodus  finds DMX showcasing remarkable versatility alongside many of his peers, including vulnerability on the album's brawniest tracks. Both ""That's My Dog"" and ""Hood Blues"" find a braggadocious X suddenly letting his voice all but fray from emotional strain, as he hits a tone between anger and agony. His fearless honesty in those moments help him reach new artistic heights, as he floors listeners with hard earned wisdom. ""Hood Blues"" in particular will sate fans nostalgic for the acidic spitting that made X an instant gangsta rap great in the '90s. Moments before prying open his heart on that track, he rhymes the ""apartheid"" of his childhood neighborhood with how its thugs ""hogtied"" victims, succinctly reestablishing his street-poet bona fides.    Part of X's renewed vigor is clearly due to the all-star guest roster longtime collaborator (and  Exodus  executive producer)  Swizz Beatz  recruited for these 13 tracks. The feeling is palpably mutual for the Griselda gangsta protégés who, on ""Hood Blues,"" engage in cipher one-upmanship with X. Their backdrop: a jazzy instrumental that lumbers with the gait of a Rottweiler circling their quarry (and features the same Lee Mason & His Orchestra horn sample Madlib and Pace Won famously employed prior). Aside from X, Benny the Butcher cuts deepest on the track with rhymes about flip-phone poverty and clasping his dirty hands in prayer, picking up where X left off on '90s hood odes like ""Slippin'."" It not only usurps the revered (yet overrated) ""4,3,2,1"" as the best posse cut the Dark Man has ever been on — it also features his rawest rhymes since ""Get at Me Dog.""    Longtime collaborators the LOX are also inarguably inspired while spitting alongside X on ""That's My Dog."" Its standout moment: Styles P viscerally rapping about a blade that isn't deadly because of its edge, but rather the rust that would infect a wound. X's  Belly  co-star Nas and one-time nemesis JAY-Z, meanwhile, supply ""Bath Salts"" with second-nature spitting befitting their elder statesmen status. Better still: DMX's recent  Verzuz  partner-in-rhyme Snoop Dogg slathering buttery rhymes on ""Take Control."" Swizz and D12's Mr. Porter together sample Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" for the song, interspersing horn stabs from that R&B classic to contrast a sprawling pitter-patter flow from X akin to what he used on ""How's It Goin' Down,"" making ""Take Control"" a worthy sequel to that  It's Dark and Hell Is Hot  sex jam (though it lacks that earlier track's narrative ambition).    It is indeed heartening to hear X go toe-to-toe again with the peers who commercially surpassed him. And yet, fans who remember how he toiled in obscurity for years will also delight in the  Exodus  tracks featuring even bigger stars from other genres. Alicia Keys yearningly sings on ""Hold Me Down,"" for instance, as X etches a tome about God's love somehow surmounting Lucifer's allure. ""Letter to My Son"" features a hook from R&B titan Usher and fluttering violins serving as an ideal foil for DMX's plainspoken fatherly dedication to his youngest son, the album's namesake (it's clear on the preceding ""Exodus Skit"" that young Exodus clearly inherited some of his dad's charisma, playfully chanting ""Go daddy!"" in a tone that will warm and break listeners' hearts). Then there's ""Skyscrapers,"" which not only boasts a towering (in every sense of the word) hook from U2's Bono, but also gut-wrenching bars from X about coming to terms with his colossal, yet troubled legacy: ""I just wanna be heard, fuck the fame / My words will live forever, fuck my name.""    By chronicling the redemptive rise and bittersweet resolution of DMX's plot-twist ridden third act,  Exodus  not only fulfills the tall order of giving a long-overlooked great a fitting send off. It's also the sound of hip-hop's Job finding meaning in his suffering — and, thankfully, peace thereafter.

2021-06-01,Adam Feibel,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC,SKA,PUNK","Just in Time for Ska's Fourth Wave, We Are the Union Deliver Their Best Album with 'Ordinary Life'",,"If ska needed a revival, no one told  We Are the Union . While there's been plenty of chatter about a new wave of ska, these L.A. punks have been going strong for most of the last 15 years, persisting through the genre's dark age. Now, that dedication looks poised to pay off in a big way with their fifth — and best — album.     Ordinary Life  is a fun-sounding yet intensely sincere record that's filled with heart and purpose. Not long before the album's release, singer Reade Wolcott came out as a trans woman, and her struggles with gender dysphoria and self-discovery are a propulsive force behind this music. With a potent mix of mid-'90s ska-punk and early-2000s pop-punk, We Are the Union have delivered 11 sharply written and highly gratifying songs about being who you are.    We Are the Union's sound hasn't changed much — aside from especially punchy, polished work here from producer Jon Graber (NOFX, Goldfinger) — but their outlook is noticeably different. The band's previous albums often came off as cynical and jaded, even by Wolcott's own admission; she seemed to be shouting out in hopes for a better world despite feeling helpless to do anything about it. In contrast,  Ordinary Life  feels boldly empowered. The album still deals with discord at both the personal and societal levels, but Wolcott is taking them on while in forward motion rather than at a standstill. The result is a record that better matches the positive energy of the music.    ""If I get one life, I'm gonna do what I want,"" Wolcott sings, laying out one of  Ordinary Life 's main themes throughout ""Morbid Obsessions,"" an energetic and deliciously joyous song that ought to be immediately retconned into  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater . ""Boys Will Be Girls"" is a trans anthem that rejects gender norms in a way that's equally confrontational and celebratory. Elsewhere, ""Pasadena"" is a punchy skate-punk song about taking things day by day, ""Make It Easy"" is a surf-rocky tune that swoons with youthful romance, ""Short Circuit"" is an  American Pie -style party-starter about the sinking feeling of guilt, and ""Big River"" is a rousing reggae bop about finding your identity. This record takes the soul-crushing sentiments of gender dysphoria, heartbreak and mental health and turns them into a feel-good summer album that feels well-earned. And all the while, those horns keep blaring with joyful defiance.    At a time when ska is being critically reassessed and early-aughts pop-punk is making its own unlikely comeback — whether it's via Olivia Rodrigo, Machine Gun Kelly or Willow Smith — this album even sounds more contemporary than you might expect. While you can draw musical parallels to ska-punk classics like Less Than Jake and Reel Big Fish or pop-punk vintages like American Hi-Fi and Treble Charger, We Are the Union are fortunately aging less like Blink-182 and more like Jeff Rosenstock.  (another artist who is  embracing ska at the moment ). The melodies are sharp, the band is tight, the lyrics are purposeful and the songs are fun yet uncorny.  Ordinary Life  is not only an upbeat, lively and catchy rock record, but a late coming-of-age moment for a well-established band who have just found their defining statement: ""We are everything but ordinary.""

In 2018, guitar pop singer-songwriter  Helena Deland  and electronic experimentalist  Ouri  presented their collaborative project  Hildegard  at Pop Montréal, which was brimming with promise. The Montreal duo's long-awaited, self-titled debut album is a fascinating excursion into both of their worlds and beyond.    The songs are titled in homage to the eight-day recording session that birthed the album, and from opener ""Jour 1"" to closer ""Jour 8,"" emotions are raw and vivid. Deland and Ouri begin on a high with the club-like ""Jour 1,"" showcasing Ouri's tantalizing electronic production. Ouri shines throughout the album both with her beats and her voice, which has a soft, particular tone that balances out Deland's signature rasp. ""Jour 4"" is a pure display of Ouri's distinctive vocals; seductive and strong, it joins the instruments in symbiosis, a weapon that is not used often enough on  Hildegard .    As for Deland, her voice is at the forefront of the album, embracing all elements while changing to suit the different songs. While ""Jour 5"" sounds most like her folk-poppy back catalogue, she takes more chances on the deep and husky ""Jour 3"" and on ""Jour 4,"" where Ouri's experimental sounds perfectly suit Deland's voice.    On  Hildegard , Deland and Ouri come together as one, their identities fusing into an entity that embodies the best they both have to offer and then some. The album pays tribute to its namesake, 12th-century nun Hildegard von Bingen, a woman of science, music and spirituality. Deland and Ouri, fittingly, have become music mystics, patron saints of experimental pop. Hildegard is not Deland or Ouri's usual work — the album finds them escaping their typical sounds, as exemplified on closer ""Jour 8,"" an offbeat tour de force.     Hildegard  lives up to the hype of the collaboration's 2018 festival debut. Rare are projects that push the boundaries of both of the parties involved. Deland and Ouri make each other better. They enter a particular synergy, close to something transcendental and spiritual, enough to turn any listener into a devout follower praying for a follow-up.

2021-06-02,Alisha Mughal,9,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Japanese Breakfast's 'Jubilee' Celebrates Life in All of Its Heartbreaking Beauty,,"Japanese Breakfast 's third studio album,  Jubilee , is a paradox: simultaneously strong and delicate. It satisfies like a Shakespearean comedy; it welcomes listeners in with a bloom like dawn, goes on to break your heart, and then with meticulous care puts you back together. Grander and more cinematic than 2016's  Psychopomp  and 2017's  Soft Sounds from Another Planet  by virtue of its strings and horns, this album is Michelle Zauner's invitation to throw caution to the wind and bask in unapologetic happiness. To dance, and even to cry — because, the album seems to say, the act of feeling itself will give you hope when nothing else can.       Zauner  describes the album as a fight for happiness , which gains special meaning in face of the fraught circumstances that birthed the band's first two albums: Zauner's mother's death due to gastrointestinal cancer. While  Psychopomp  and  Soft Sounds  had a specific and urgent feeling — grief and working through it — as their thesis, this album is guided by a striving to feel at all. Each track is a confined attempt at gaiety, a succinct story in service of this greater mission of uninhibited emotion — which is ultimately, hopefully joy.       The record opens with ""Paprika,"" which is all horns and flourishes in what is the sonic equivalent of a rousing from sleep, fresh and bright. ""Slide Tackle"" has a sax solo that gives Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Run Away With Me"" a run for its money. The first half of the album is playful in this way, even a track like ""Kokomo, IN,"" which sings of the sweet loneliness of waiting for your crush to return as a teen. But halfway through, Zauner's trenchant lyricism, the gravity of which you could easily miss in the funkiness of something like ""Be Sweet,"" becomes difficult to ignore.     ""The world divides into two people,"" Zauner sings on ""Posing in Bondage,"" ""those who have felt pain and those who have yet to."" These heavier tracks, whose sombreness is almost sneaky, punctuate the album — they do have a poppy, jaunty beat, and you can still dance to them when you're tipsy, but when you become drunk you might weep. Don't second-guess your tears, though, because it's all in keeping with the aim of  Jubilee : crying for Zauner is a reminder that you're alive, a relief that can lead to joy. Zauner wants you to be soaked through and through with emotion. ""Hell is finding someone to love and I can't have you,"" Zauner sings on ""In Hell."" It's an insistent refrain that stings fiercely.    Final track ""Posing for Cars"" is the grandest of finales because it best exemplifies the album's aim, which is to help you feel with the acuteness of adolescence. Zauner sings of a an emptiness so vast it hurts to think about — but her voice, as she sings of the uncertainty of time, seems consoling, like she's smiling. The strings, a gently-plucked electric guitar, a stately piano, and jubilant horns create a grandness that propels listeners toward happiness, validating whatever might be going through your head.      Jubilee  isn't about pushing the pain away; rather, it's a validation of whatever it is you feel. Zauner wants you to know with this record that you have the capacity to find joy in whatever mess life throws your way. Zauner's voice contains a sensuality that runs down your spine and seeps into your pores, working through your viscera and making you feel alive.

2021-06-02,Luke Pearson,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",cleopatrick Give Drums-and-Guitar Rock a Hip-Hop Twist on 'BUMMER',,"Hailing from what is described self-deprecatingly as Nowheretown in their press release, we feel it our patriotic duty to inform you that promising drums-and-guitar duo  cleopatrick 's debut LP was actually cooked up in the quiet town of Cobourg, ON. Made up of childhood friends Luke Gruntz and Ian Fraser, the Canadian pair deliver a solid offering of fuzzed-out garage rock on their first outing, and while much of your appreciation of  BUMMER  may derive from a prior affinity for stripped-down drums-and-guitar rock generally, their deft weaving of hip-hop elements into their sound is an interesting twist that sets the album apart from the usual two-person riff-fests.     But riffs there certainly are on  BUMMER , and excellent grooves too, and plenty of pounding, cathartic moments throughout. The energy is impressively confident and mature for a debut, with Gruntz and Fraser having clearly been playing together for years, likely even learning their instruments alongside each other. There's definitely a unique energy that comes out of the music of super close relationships like this — there's a reason guitar and drum arrangements remain a viable choice, despite being limiting in other respects. And while Gruntz and Fraser definitely reap the benefits of the setup (effortless, locked-in synergy and an almost psychic give-and-take), their palette is obviously restricted by it as well, and intimacy, no matter how skilfully dialled-in, can lead to claustrophobia after a while.     The hip-hop spin they add is a pretty effective solution though, creating space and rhythmic possibilities that might not have sounded natural otherwise. It's fairly slight, a quick inflection here, some weighted phrasing there, but it all flows smoothly and never sounds forced or self-conscious in the way so many contrived rap bridges or interludes do. More than anything, it just sounds thoroughly contemporary, in the sense that syncopated vocal delivery is common in popular music across the board at this point. It would be an overstatement to say it's the album's defining feature however; the pair are mostly rocking pretty hard on  BUMMER , with a slide into soulful, Kings of Leon-style emotiveness here and there.     Some additional layers wouldn't hurt next time around, and perhaps some brighter, more varied production when the opportunity arises, but this is a solid, high-energy debut from a pair that definitely has their style figured out already, with lots of room to build.

2021-06-02,Adam Feibel,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Elliot Maginot's 'Easy Morning' Is Shockingly Complex for an All-Acoustic Album,,"Elliot Maginot  continues to widen his horizons with  Easy Morning , the Montreal singer-songwriter's most musically diverse and thorough record yet. With his 2014 debut album  Young/Old/Everything.in.Between , Maginot pursued the type of ambient, melancholic alt-folk style with which Julien Baker has since become virtually synonymous. He went much bigger and bolder for his second album, 2018's  Comrades , recording warm, '80s-inspired pop-rock songs with generous arrangements that brought to mind the lushness of  Bon Iver, Bon Iver . With  Easy Morning , Maginot takes another step further, venturing far from the confines of North American music and incorporating a long, long list of instruments, pulling largely from European classical orchestration and traditional West African sounds.    This disguises the fact that  Easy Morning  is an entirely acoustic album; in fact, it's Maginot's first fully acoustic album. Turning to the basics of the acoustic guitar after multiple records of rich, reverberating electric tones isn't a surprising move for a singer-songwriter of Maginot's persuasion. What's a bit surprising — and even a little funny — is that although one of the main temptations of an ""unplugged"" album is the stripped-down, one-take simplicity of writing and recording it,  Easy Morning  is actually Maginot's most complexly assembled record yet.     There are horns, flutes, clarinets, saxophones, strings, banjo, mandolin, Wurlitzer, kora, charango, balafon, marimba, glockenspiel, accordion, xylophone… the list goes on. It can sometimes feel like a bit much, but it works. While some artists' globetrotting efforts may wind up almost as disastrously contrived as  Infant Sorrow's ""African Child,""  Maginot's multicultural mix sounds reasonably authentic. Even the more jam-packed songs like ""Dead Church"" and ""Emilio (Any Day Now)"" are airy and groovy, with Maginot's lilting voice floating on a breeze.     With producer Connor Seidel again at the helm,  Easy Morning  is a pristine-sounding record. ""Holy Water"" has a lush, gorgeous soundscape that dips into minor keys just long enough to make the return home that much more satisfying. Similarly, ""Holy Father"" builds an engrossing atmosphere that slowly unfolds with percussive flutes and a commendable string quartet arrangement by Antoine Gratton. Throughout, Maginot's vocal harmonies remain sublime, and he plays the Spanish guitar with a Leonard Cohen-esque sensibility. Interspersed between the songs are clips of rooms full of conversation as well as the quiet scratches of a lonesome cabin retreat, evoking both the bustle of the city and the quiet of the country.    Maginot's lyricism is evocative and open-ended, with poetry that feels pointed yet leaves the option to meld it to one's own interpretations. Throughout these songs, he sings broadly of efforts to understand and be understood, to point out one's failings and make them right. Yet the album's rich, glowing scenery tends to camouflage the darkness in Maginot's writing: There's a cold, bitter anger that's hidden under the warm, sweet surface of ""Dead Men Walking,"" a wry pessimism in the jaunty folk of ""True Love Might Not Find You in the End,"" and a sense of powerlessness underscoring the dark, mysterious force of the album's title track.     Eclectic and organic,  Easy Morning  reaffirms Maginot as a visionary talent in Canadian music. There are perhaps more exceptional songs to be found elsewhere in his catalogue, but his arrangements here are unparalleled. The sounds that had begun to enter Maginot's vocabulary in  Comrades  have now become his primary musical language. Constantly evolving while showing an eagerness to transcend borders and genres, Maginot demands renewed attention with each record. It's hard to predict what may come next.

2021-06-02,Alisha Mughal,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Nadjiwan Harnesses the Cosmic Power of Prog Rock on 'Star Nation',,"Toronto-based musician  Nadjiwan 's latest album,  Star Nation , tells a mighty tale of a journey from Earth to distant planets and back. It opens hopefully, feeling like sun streaming through a foggy dawn, all cymbals and faint piano — aptly, the opening track is called ""Into the Abyss"" — and closes with pomp and grandeur, with a roaring tune called, aptly again, ""Homecoming."" It's a unique and electric, familiar but different experience that  Star Nation  shares, one clothed masterfully in prog rock splendour, and elevated by the heft of project mastermind Marc Meriläinen's perspective and knowledge. Part genre reinvention — recalling but also crucially reimagining something like, say,  The Dark Side of the Moon  — and part poetic storytelling,  Star Nation  is an enveloping, interstellar journey on which Nadjiwan serves as a confident and comforting guide.    Meriläinen is of the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation. Among other of the stories he learned through his culture were stories of star people;  Star Nation , Meriläinen has said, is in part the result of stories and experiences shared with him by his mother, Hilda Nadjiwan. On this album, Meriläinen has taken inspiration from his mother's and culture's stories, and has gone on to create a fictional universe that houses his own new tales, new contributions. Indeed, each track on the record is titled as though it were a chapter within a larger narrative, and it has its own mood, attitude, message — 10 tracks come together to make up an album that is deeply profound, multilayered as any canonical text.    For example, ""Dark Forest Theory"" is a rock masterpiece, with a driving bass line, roaring guitar, and an ominous message. ""Can you see them, can you hear them?"" Meriläinen's voice refrains, singing of something difficult to see or hear but that is an indisputable threat, going on to warn, ""if you run you better be fast,"" in an almost snarl. This track seems to have two characters, one the dangerous pursuer and one the frightened, whispering pursued — both are played by Meriläinen, his voice changing with each character's desires.    Each track's title is a beautiful complement to what it contains. ""The Planets"" is a jazzy, mellow delight. ""Spiraling through stardust, always moving, never resting, seeking to join the light, trying to outrun the night,"" Meriläinen speaks on this track, whose trumpets sound with an almost Lynchian bent. On many tracks, Meriläinen showcases his strength as a singer, weaving in his Indigenous heritage throughout via language and also through the versatility of his vocal range. ""While the universe boasts infinite wonders and resources, our lives do not,"" he speaks, ""and when the end comes, what do we know, what have we learned? Who are you now? The answer lies deep inside, deep within our own cosmos."" Everything is pain and beauty at once as we are hurled through space, our lives, Meriläinen says. This is a beautiful track that is existential uncertainty wrapped in a gauzy, jazzy sound that makes the listener feel excited to learn the universe's answers.    The tracks together tell us of our finiteness, fallibility, smallness, our pain wrought unto ourselves and others, while juxtaposing these — through words and music — with the glory and glittery resoluteness of the universe. A track that takes sympathy on our suffering is mid-album highlight ""The Ghosts We Leave Behind,"" where a certain mightiness is at work against the narrator's message. Meriläinen's voice is raw and soft as he sings ""sometimes words are kind, and sometimes they break the heart."" He seems to understand that tales of how the world work have the power to sap us of our individual power, and so Meriläinen is here to console on this track, speaking of all we do to find meaning in the world.    Meriläinen sings heartbreakingly of each our tremendous endeavours to find union, to keep from getting lost, to preserve ourselves through songs and stories. But as crucial as his words are, they compete to be heard against the beauty of the music: the blooms of a gently-plucked electric guitar and clash of silvery percussions, which come as waves, threatening to drown out Meriläinen's voice at times. This track is powerful enough to make you weep, even as it takes care of you. Meanwhile, ""Around the Sun"" is blazing, its rock flavoured by leather and chains. If the sun could write a rock song, this track would be it.    This album is one that Nadjiwan crafted with care and precision, with each track contributing something different while still hewing to the album's thesis of helping us understand the surrounding vast space. This album is expertly produced and thoughtfully arranged, with each track intricately and carefully woven into the next and fleshed out to contain its own mighty narrative.  Star Nation  is deeply nostalgic in its prog rock leanings, but also so refreshingly new by virtue of Meriläinen's beautiful, vast tales and keen eye. This record is a pocket-sized journey through being and nothingness, one that only Nadjiwan could take us on.

2021-06-02,Adam Fink,8,"EP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Vancouver's IAMTHELIVING and Teon Gibbs Put a Soulful Spin on Heady Themes on 'JNGL',,"The streets of South London and the savannahs of Botswana couldn't be more different, but from these two distant places comes a unique and exciting new musical collaboration. Rian Peters, a.k.a.  IAMTHELIVING , grew up in South East London and was absolutely charmed by the sounds of classic soul and R&B artists like Prince and Stevie Wonder before following his destiny to the West Coast of Canada.  Teon Gibbs  was born in Botswana and also eventually settled in Vancouver after moving around the globe through most of his upbringing. It was in Vancouver that Gibbs and Peters connected, discovered shared musical passions, and decided to collaborate on their fantastic new EP,  JNGL . The EP showcases both performers' magnetic charisma and, through the album's five tracks, a thoughtfulness that you rarely find with such young creatives.    When Peters sings, ""Tell me can you feel it?"" right at the top of the EP's lead track, ""Puppa,"" you would be lying if you said you couldn't. The production is a blend of head-bopping beats courtesy of producer Cheap Limousine and Peters' buttery vocals. On its own, that seems like it would be enough to guarantee the track would soar, but when Gibbs breaks through with his first verse, it sends the proceedings into the stratosphere. His flow is something special, perfectly complementing Peters' vocal style and adding some extra heat to an already spicy track.    The duo are not just content to make you want to dance, though. Throughout the EP, they address topics like addiction (""Translation""), race (""Where Do We Go from Here"") and environmental concerns, but they tackle these heady issues without sacrificing any of the record's bounce. Combining both their natural ability at blending serious themes with soulful tracks makes the EP considerably more engaging. It's this thoughtfulness that sets these two apart from many of their contemporaries and makes you realize how impactful this pairing is. Album highlight ""Distance"" wouldn't feel out of place in Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' repertoire. The filtered hi-hats and Peter's irresistible soprano have that throwback quality, but Gibbs keeps things entirely in the now with his surefire rap artistry.    Vancouver isn't typically known as a hotbed of hip-hop and R&B, but with Gibbs' and Peters' respective solo work and their collaboration on  JNGL , that should change soon. At only 17 minutes, the EP does feel a bit short, but that is mostly because the duo are adept at keeping everything moving at a brisk pace — it's all so good that it's hard not to feel slightly sad that there isn't more to dig into.    The pairing of these two talents — with not only great songs and production, but also a willingness to go to places that most artists would be afraid to — makes  JNGL  a collaboration that we hope happens again in the future.

2021-05-25,Heather Taylor-Singh,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Olivia Rodrigo's 'SOUR' Captures the Beautiful Chaos of a Teenage Brain,,"Olivia Rodrigo  is not a one-hit wonder. After the breakout success of ""drivers license"" earlier this year, the 18-year-old has released her debut album,  SOUR , a mere four months later— and she's ready to tell us exactly how she's feeling: ""God, it's brutal out here,"" she mutters on the opening track. From this moment, listeners are catapulted into Rodrigo's vignettes of heartbreak and insecurity, solidifying her voice as one of this generation's most honest pop singers.     SOUR  is adventurous for Rodrigo, who was a relatively under-the-radar Disney actor until a few months ago. But this newfound fame doesn't seem to have gone to Rodrigo's head: the album is filled with angst and self-doubt, which feels representative of who she currently is as a songwriter. When you're young, every moment feels significant and Rodrigo manages to be extremely vulnerable and relatable while describing the rollercoaster of emotions she has experienced in her adolescence.    Despite her youthfulness, Rodrigo is a very specific songwriter. She writes with great detail and paints a vivid picture for listeners. The hypnotic ""deja vu"" displays the nuances of young love, as Rodrigo is nostalgic for eating strawberry ice cream and watching  Glee  reruns. On ""favorite crime,"" she hauntingly sings about a relationship that felt akin to being lawless. This distinct storytelling feels reminiscent of Taylor Swift, whom Rodrigo has cited as an inspiration. Through these narratives Rodrigo creates a special world for her listeners.    As  SOUR  progresses, some of the themes get repetitive, as Rodrigo spends most of the album's runtime singing about someone who broke her heart and quickly moved on with no remorse for their actions. It's hard to fault Rodrigo, who was deeply affected by this breakup. She seems to be singing from lived experiences, rather than curating dreamy narratives she can't relate to. She manages to turn her unhappy moments into succinct songs that feel universal for anyone going through heartache and feeling insecure about themselves. The strongest tracks from this narrative are the piano-driven ""1 step forward, 3 steps back,"" and the acoustic ballad ""enough for you,"" where Rodrigo is at her most raw and grappling with the aftermath of a turbulent relationship.    While the majority of the tracks are soft ballads,  SOUR  is lightly sprinkled with moodier moments like ""good 4 u,"" a cheeky tune that sounds like a nod to early 2000s pop-punk with its punchy drums and shouty, echoing vocals. There's also ""jealousy, jealousy,"" a track featuring a bubbling bass in which Rodrigo seethes about her envy on social media and society's unrealistic standards for young people. Rodrigo's lyrics are sombre, but these grittier, more upbeat cuts sprinkled throughout the tracklist feel like a break from her downtempo moments. This displays Rodrigo's versatility as a budding artist who is growing into her sound.    By the end of the album, Rodrigo has established her voice and showed listeners that she's not afraid to be vulnerable.  SOUR  is a strong debut that vividly illustrates the beautiful chaos of being inside a teenage girl's brain.

2021-05-26,Wesley McLean,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",YG and Mozzy Give California Hip-Hop Their 'Kommunity Service',,"Following the release of Jay-Z and Kanye West's 2011 effort  Watch the Throne , collaborative albums have seemingly become much more commonplace in hip-hop's landscape. A multitude of established artists have taken heed from the duo since, joining forces with their frequent collaborators to create releases that feel more like massive crossover events than traditional album releases. With  Kommunity Service , West Coast hip-hop mainstays  YG  and  Mozzy  are the latest pair to attempt to capture that feeling.    This album is a move that makes perfect sense for the California duo, given their collaborative track record. Whenever they've connected in the past, YG and Mozzy have always complemented each other very well, showcasing a very organic sense of chemistry and crafting great songs. The challenge with this record is recreating the magic that they've captured on tracks like ""Thugz Mansion"" and stretching it across an entire album, especially given that they're in two completely different places in their respective careers.    It's hard not to notice the contrast — Mozzy has been on an incredible run, highlighted by the four solid collaborative efforts and three excellent solo releases he's dropped since early 2019. Meanwhile, YG has been struggling to meet the incredibly high bar he set for himself following his 2014 debut  My Krazy Life  and its follow-up  Still Brazy , though his 2020 effort  My Life 4Hunnid  is the closest he's come since. The disparity between the pair is enough to be wary of the quality of a full-length project, despite their history as collaborators and the two excellent singles that preceded this release.    Thankfully,  Kommunity Service  puts any wariness to rest almost immediately, as both YG and Mozzy come out of the gate swinging from the opening four-count of the album's intro, ""Gangsta."" Mozzy floats all over the track's exuberant and hard-hitting instrumental, which re-works the classic 50 Cent track ""Wanksta"" impeccably, while YG attacks the beat with a fire that's been absent in his music for years. It's an intro that perfectly sets the tone for the project, showcasing two artists that bring the absolute best out of each other.    This synergy permeates throughout nearly the entire runtime of this LP, as YG and Mozzy go verse-for-verse on every track with relative ease, regardless of the track's instrumental. The two sound just as comfortable on aggressive bass-heavy bangers like ""Bompton to Oak Park"" as they do on the sunnier, smoother tracks like the Ty Dolla $ign-assisted ""Vibe with You."" Regardless of the topic YG and Mozzy are rapping about, whether it be gang culture, poverty, loss or even romance, the pair deliver verses that aren't just individually great but complement each other nicely.     Part of what makes their contributions so complementary to one another is how well the contrasting aspects of their vocal deliveries. YG's has a bounce to his flow that pairs very well with his smooth vocal tone and delivery, stylistically similar to Snoop Dogg, while Mozzy's voice and delivery are raspy, gruff and more emotive, akin to MCs like 2Pac and Scarface. It's these distinct differences between their respective styles that create such a captivating dynamic between them, and that's the glue that holds this album together, even in its weaker moments.    The only real flaw with  Kommunity Service  is the sheer number of features that appear through its relatively short runtime. It's not that they're all bad —  Young M.A ,  G Herbo  and  Ty Dolla $ign  deliver fantastic contributions here — but  Tyga 's completely unnecessary ""Toot It Up"" verse and  A Boogie wit da Hoodie 's generic and uninspired ""Drop a Location"" hook stand out due to just how weak they are. This creates an even bigger issue for the album, as those two songs play back-to-back at the halfway mark of an otherwise fantastic 10-track project, which leaves it feeling slightly front-loaded.    Still,  Kommunity Service  manages to deliver on almost every front. It's an impressive collaborative effort from two of California's brightest stars, yet another solid release in Mozzy's rapidly expanding catalogue and a much-needed return to form for YG following a few subpar releases. While it might not be groundbreaking, it's still a great collection of boisterous, summer-ready bangers that sound their best in a car, with the windows down and the bass cranked all the way up.

2021-05-26,Max Heilman,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",Portal 'Avow' Extreme Metal Aberration on Their Sixth Album,,"Everyone acknowledged Portal as trailblazers once they dropped  Swarth  in 2009 and  Vexovoid  four years later, but these Australian maniacs have spent over 25 years pushing the envelope. They approach extreme metal like an impressionist painter, illustrating vistas of cosmic horror with mutated riffs and cavernous vocals. No one could expect accessibility from a band that adopts stage names like Horror Illogium and takes the stage dressed like a grandfather clock, but Portal's music remained nigh impenetrable until 2018's  ION . Portal's true genius began to escape from their sonic vortex — aptly setting up  Avow  to take a strikingly direct approach to a sound of such obscure repute.    This album's discernibility is obviously relative to Portal's brand of terrifying cacophony. Opener ""Catafalque"" certainly proves as unfriendly as ever, with blast beats, tremolo-picked guitars and ghastly vocals generating utter insanity. Nonlinear rhythms and ascending chromatic tempests inexplicably start to sound like a sports car shifting gears, introducing violent, grating hypnosis to contrast  ION 's breakneck unpredictability. The filth-crusted dirge of ""Eye"" doubles down on this balance of avant-garde metal and dark ambient, with lumbering drums and droning, atonal guitars embodying a spiritual black hole.    These slower passages balance well with the frenzied chaos, deepening  Avow 's impact. A cut like ""Offune"" transforms its initial wall of surging sound into its closing abyssal misery, as Portal gradually take the wind out of their sails in an immersive exercise in deceleration. These fluctuating tempos directly contrast with death metal's usual grid-locked precision, while songs like ""Manor of Speaking"" reveal more of Portal's stylistic lineage — specifically, New York death metal legends Incantation. Unorthodox chords and inhuman growls aside, the bulk of this song offers a surprisingly recognizable rhythm structure before its final quarter becomes a horrific soundscape of textural anti-riffs.    In a genre bred for its scare factor, Portal remain a final boss of aural aberration. It's hard not to think of Cthulhu emerging from cyclopean ruins when ""Bode"" slowly materializes its ominous arrangement. The band practically engage in psychological warfare, building tension with repetitive death meditations before barreling into an all-out assault. The fact this album isn't as technical as  ION  stops mattering once the nuance of these wretched sounds set in. There's a reason closing cut ""Drain"" can spend two minutes wandering through catacombs of low-end noise before falling into a demonic waltz. Every crushing chug or flesh-ripping avalanche has its place in the world-crushing whole.    Where  ION  kept up its riff-a-minute onslaught from start to finish,  Avow  allows more time for songs to breathe. Portal milk these ideas for their entire worth of atmospheric pandemonium, drilling their uncompromising, nonconformist motifs straight into the soul.

2021-05-26,Allie Gregory,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",N0V3L Grapple with Vancouver's Broken Systems on 'NON-FICTION',,"First and foremost, BC post-punk outfit N0V3L fiercely identify as anti-capitalists. It's a personal statement that extends to the artistic intentions contained in their debut full-length record,  NON-FICTION  — a functionalist, stony political excursion that parses through manifestations of injustice, inequity and broken systems.    With  NON-FICTION , vocalist Jon Varley has largely ditched the shrill, new-wave bravado vocal stylings that accented the group's tightly-wound 2019 self-titled EP in favour of a more brutalist, deadpan delivery. Backed by understated, sluggish basslines and frenetic, interwoven guitars, Varley's lyrics paint an extremely grey portrait of modern-day life, examining the symptoms of capitalism through the lens of Vancouver's unforgiving housing market, populism gone awry and the West Coast's opioid crisis without ever feeling too heavy-handed.    Written between 2017 and 2020 in the band's since-torn down Vancouver rental home, N0V3L's debut LP finds the band adopting the sonic fashions and palettes of '70s and '80s post-punk, staunchly positioning themselves as musical dissidents ousted from the ethos of their own decade, a rebellious alternative to the default. N0V3L sometimes stray into not-like-other-bands territory when aesthetics take precedence over content, but for the most part, the group have presented a thorough and sympathetic read-through of their socially-minded positions.    Standout tracks like ""UNTOUCHABLE"" and ""STRANGER"" offer monochromatic dancefloor sensibilities while album closer ""NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE"" sees the group grimly ruminating on the instability of metropolitan life. On the track, Varley murmurs , ""Forced adaptation, notice of foreclosure / Dragging us forward, an indifferent future,"" signalling a growing sense of collective insecurity and hopelessness felt not only in their home province, but globally.    The record may be an intentionally dreary outing, but it's a compulsory statement about present-day politics. Taking the form of the self-described ""macabre late-capitalist disco,"" the band's particular flavour of alternative music makes the project's message pleasantly jarring and all the more rugged. Simultaneously sleek and jagged, N0V3L's debut is a strong starting point for a band who have already decided what they're all about.

Too queer for country, too country for pop, lang's musical expression was obscured in plain view, but at the same time, she was cultivating a devoted fan base that glommed on to her articulations of queer, female desire.    With  makeover , a new release compiling remixes of hits lang released from 1992 through 2000, it's suggested that her persona precipitated an adoring following in the underground dance community, too.     ""I had the idea of putting together a dance remix compilation, as I mused about how we built community in those days before the internet, mobile devices, and dating apps,"" lang offers in a release. ""Those dance clubs were a key to a world, which was still called 'underground' in the '90s. I also surprised myself by finding that there was a cryptic, sort of secret zone in my career, that hadn't been explored, overlooked even by me.""    With that framing,  makeover  sounds like a landmark archival project, but its mythologizing leaves out the part where the tracks it positions as carefully curated, once well-cherished artifacts were readily available (save for some license wrangling, probably), all originally packaged with singles by the majors lang worked with, surely as a gesture to incentivize consumers.     If this weird posturing — ""Two of these tracks had even hit #1 on the dance charts!"" — isn't a complete turn-off, the final product still kind of works. Reset in swirling, spectacular motion, mixes from elusive industry pros of the era expertly locate lang's tendency to occupy a space at the intersection of internal investigation and extroverted expression, and they ride the tension to some pretty ecstatic release, that's at once of its time but remarkably all over the board.    Ben Grosse and Lang's own ""Club Xanax Mix"" of ""Lifted by Love"" gives the track a Sade groove, Tony Garcia's ""Just Keep Me Moving"" mixes trade the original's cow-funk in first for a throbbing house atmosphere and then a paisley jungle sitar jam primed for the open-toed hacky sack crowd, and a Love to Infinity ""Radio Mix"" of ""The Consequences of Falling"" invigorates the downtempo original with a confidently shimmering house treatment that's glitter all over, while their ""Funk Mix"" thumps into the night.    In a hypothetical live setting, Tony Maserati's ""Final Radio Remix"" of ""Sexuality"" would be a bit of a nonstarter in the same set, but  DJ Krush 's take on the track taps into its mystery and recasts it as noir trip-hop inquiry.    If lang's songs were idiosyncratic expressions of one woman's desires, they had a versatility that made them ripe for dancefloor application, plum full of secret yearning and grand gestures. Captured on this awkwardly marketed remix compilation, they're just as galvanizing, and as this package arrives just in time for Pride Month — potential libidinal repression of a second consecutive pandemic summer be damned — they sound just as timeless and nostalgic as ever.

2021-05-27,Calum Slingerland,7,"POP AND ROCK,EP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",'Saskadelphia' Is a Snapshot of the Tragically Hip Becoming Themselves,,"With their 1991 sophomore album  Road Apples , the Tragically Hip sought to capture the sound and energy of their live performances in a studio recording. The touring before and after the success of 1989 debut  Up to Here  primed them to do so; an itinerary so packed that drummer Johnny Fay  now recalls , ""It seemed like the clubs were the same size, and you could be anywhere.""    Before  Road Apples ,  Saskadelphia  was the name chosen from the list of the band's road-worn working titles for the LP, but was rejected by the band's American record label for being ""too Canadian."" It's the Hip and  their new-old management  who get the last laugh now, giving that name to a six-song collection that arrived in time to soundtrack both Victoria Day celebrations and the national playoff hockey broadcast.     Saskadelphia 's six tracks, all of which were written with  Road Apples  in mind, were previously known amongst the hippest of Hip fans that had long traded bootleg recordings, lyrics and live performance stories online. Five studio versions and a live inclusion now surface from the vault, giving a further look at an energetic young outfit beginning to push at the possibilities of what they could be.    True to the gritty aims of  Road Apples ,  Saskadelphia 's foundation is built upon the driving rock that defines the Hip's second LP. ""Ouch"" finds frontman Gord Downie ""drunk on naiveté,"" grinding his vocal cords with each pass of the wind-up guitar riff. On ""Not Necessary,"" voice and instruments dovetail for a chorus that commands listeners to shake off what weighs them down, while ""Crack My Spine Like a Whip"" employs a directness and delivery akin to a deep catalogue burner like ""Lionized.""    The Hip's bar-band roots are further exposed with two closing tracks built to bring down the house. ""Just as Well"" finds Downie traveling ""the road to hell,"" more than content to playfully drag a passenger along with him: ""I'll know right away when we're in the right place / 'Cause I'll see it tense up the muscles of your face."" Meanwhile, the snare-smacking stomp of ""Reformed Baptist Blues"" brings Downie to preach, ""God's salvation doesn't interest me at all / Found the answer at the bottom of a bottle,"" letting out a few yelps before a solo section and busy bass line kick into gear.    While its studio version could not be dug up for inclusion, ""Montreal"" is the lone track to demonstrate Downie's writing of places and events that would endear the Tragically Hip to listeners from coast to coast. Written about the misogynist École Polytechnique massacre, the frontman introduced it as ""a song about the identification process"" in performing the song in its titular city on the anniversary of the event. Fay believes that Downie's introduction refers to the work of a coroner, and its chorus could be interpreted as such: ""Don't you worry / Her mother's going to make her look good.""    While it's hard to imagine these songs supplanting the material picked for  Road Apples ,  Saskadelphia  is a rocking addendum to this chapter of Tragically Hip history that captures a band increasingly confident and loose — characteristics those early years of music making surely demanded.

2021-05-27,Allie Gregory,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Palehound and Jay Som Break the Supergroup Mould on Bachelor's 'Doomin' Sun',,"Palehound 's Ellen Kempner and  Jay Som 's Melina Duterte were already big fans of each other before meeting backstage at a Sacramento show in 2017. As two of indie rock's brightest rising stars, their paths were fated to cross, and serendipitously, that first encounter was also the spark that lit the fire in their platonic love story. As their budding friendship grew, as did their inevitable professional relationship — out of which Bachelor, their new supergroup, was born.    Pre-pandemic 2020 found the pair descending on a California Airbnb, officially cohabitating for two weeks to write and record their debut album,  Doomin' Sun . What came of those hazy, joke-fueled sessions was a collection of sun-soaked bass-heavy tunes confronting a range of topics from climate change to the queer experience. In melding their expert musical sensibilities — anchored by Duterte's unique production style and Kempner's evocative lyricism — they've created something so expectedly pure and joyful that its only surprising factor is that they didn't make it happen sooner.    Inhabiting a familial flavour of indie rock — Duterte's self-described ""headphone music"" to Kempner's ""journal rock"" — undoubtedly aids in their sonic compatibility. That blend is most apparent in the record's opening track ""Back of My Hand,"" a delightful love song that merges the stylings of Jay Som's  Anak Ko   track ""Devotion"" and Palehound's  Black Friday  single ""Aaron."" Here, Kempner's blazing East Coast garage rock riffs are a guide to Duterte's West Coast slacker vibes. Conversely, album cuts ""Spin Out"" and Bachelor's first-ever collaboration ""Sand Angel"" find the pair trading off vocal harmonies and adopting Jay Som's sludgier, psychedelic slow-burner songwriting ethos.     Doomin' Sun  really takes off with ""Stay in the Car,"" an ode to an anonymous miscreant and her trusty chauffeur. ""Double parked with the door swung wide / FM preacher, the radio's high / Hair in a tantrum / Eyes like two streaks of fire,"" the pair sing, painting an alluring portrait of a prototypical Floridian eccentric, the best-case product of American exceptionalism. It's the type of minutiae for which Kempner has long exhibited a keen eye and the song's anecdotal imagery is doubly compounded by Duterte's roaring production.    But where the album's real strength lies is in its process. Out in that Topanga, CA, house where the pair brought their songs to fruition, they also made sure to prioritize relaxation. Converging in late mornings to munch breakfast, jamming during the day, parting ways to write separately and later reconvening to binge episodes of their favourite shows proved to be a successful routine for Bachelor's pressure-free songwriting mission. By design, it doesn't sound all that different from a comfortable life one might have with a roommate or sibling. The record's foundations as a family affair are only further reflected in its additional contributions by friends of the band,  Big Thief 's  Buck Meek  and  James Krivchenia  (guitar and drums, respectively), as well as Duterte's partner/ Routine  bandmate,  Chastity Belt 's Annie Truscott, who tracked string accents for the album.    With supergroups like boygenius and Broken Bells before them, the blueprint for Bachelor's creative partnership was already well established in the genre's canon, and yet, Duterte and Kempner manage to break the mould with  Doomin' Sun , proving their chops as singular visionaries as well as synergetic collaborators.

2021-05-27,Daniel Sylvester,7,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",'Clara' Further Proves Loscil's Undying Commitment to a Concept,,"Over his 22-year career, Scott Morgan (a.k.a.  Loscil ) has crafted music based on various conceptual muses, be it visual and musical (as with the photographs of clouds and piano samples on 2019's  Equivalents ) or even existential (life's resistance to dark forces on 2016's  Monument Builders ).  Clara , his 13th LP — and first after a two-year excursion that consisted of him taking on audio-visual projects — finds the Canadian artist undergoing his most regulated confines yet.    The 10-track LP is pulled from a single source; a three-minute composition taken from a 22-piece string orchestra in Budapest, Hungary. If this conjures up the notion of  Clara  being an extremely limited and staid piece of art, you're probably not familiar with Morgan's methods. All 70 minutes of the LP ebb and flow in the same direction, as moods and tone clusters migrate across the entire recording, with only a select islands of musical respite to grasp on to. But this seems to be the point of  Clara .    The record begins with possibly the most orthodox arrangement, as ""Lux"" finds Morgan using a snail's pace repetition to create the album's hypnotic mood and meditative flow. The warm and almost lurid ""Lucida"" shows off the work from the sampled orchestra excellently, as Morgan allows the strings and brass to brush up against each other, while anchoring both with a beacon pulse. A fragile single-digit synth throb found at the end of ""Stella"" gently snaps the fluttering drone of this 10-minute song, while the bubbling vibrations that appear in the middle of ""Sol"" are presented as parallel-universe crashing timpani.    Despite the varying runtimes of each track (which range between five and 10 minutes), Morgan ensures each movement is paced and encased similarly, keeping the integrity of the source material recognizable and intact. ""Aura"" and ""Flamma,"" the dual centrepieces of the album's second half, fit together wonderfully, as the record's most spacious and minimal tracks find Morgan spilling processed waves of sound over a combined 15-minute bed of yearning synth and wandering keys. ""Orta"" works off of the album's opening repetition, as Morgan brings the pace of the album back to a heartbeat stride, allowing a skipping rhythm and a repeating muted gong to ease the listener into its final coda.    At a protracted 70 minutes, Morgan's latest may be a bit too arduous for its foundation, but Loscil has always been an artist unafraid to exhaust an idea to its fullest, and  Clara  proves this in spades.

2021-05-27,Adam Feibel,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Needles//Pins' Self-Titled Album Is as Tight as It Gets,,"Four years removed from  Good Night, Tomorrow , Vancouver punk veterans  Needles//Pins  return with a new collection of dirty, gritty and reliably catchy tunes. In 2017, the band's third album left behind the '70s power-pop revivalism of their first couple of records in exchange for the gruff, folksy melodies of mid-2000s orgcore. Now, they've been working on tightening up their act and pushing for a spot in their hall of heroes. Needles//Pins would fit perfectly on the rosters of Jade Tree, No Idea or Fat Wreck among shoo-in The Fest headliners like the Lawrence Arms, Hot Water Music, Against Me! and Off with Their Heads.    In this album, guitar chords are as much of a language as lyrics. Whether it's the bittersweet folk-rock of  ""Woe Is Us,"" the downtempo blues of ""Winnipeg '03,"" or the anthemic punk rock of ""A Rather Strained Apologetic,"" Needles//Pins take a tried-and-true approach to songcraft that's admittedly uninventive but, in many cases, undoubtedly effective. These songs are loaded up with finely tuned melodies and group-effort harmonies. With 10 songs clocking in a total of less than 23 minutes, the record is also about as tight and efficient as it gets.    Adam Solomonian's gravelly, whiskey-soaked voice leads the way through songs about being down on your luck, weary with the world or just flat-out bored and lonely. ""We are nothing anyhow / Get so close but we can't get out,"" he sings in the steadily rising ennui of ""Gleamer."" Solomonian still only has one setting — occasionally undermining the band's dynamics — but in that sincere, full-blast delivery, he does sound the most natural he has ever sounded. Plus, it ought to work like a charm if the goal is to get a room full of sweaty people singing along.    Despite the buzzsaw guitars, full-steam-ahead rhythms and raw-throated vocal delivery, the album has a comforting feel to it — a sense of nostalgic Americana glimmering under the grit. It's not just because the trio have wisely incorporated musical touches like the warm hum of an organ and the subtle twang of an acoustic guitar; the songs just tend to ring with familiarity.    Granted, there are already lots of bands that sound exactly like this (and, while we're being honest, it's not exactly a sound that's particularly in fashion these days). But what makes Needles//Pins largely worthwhile is that the band have written some really good songs with strong hooks, lots of energy and a touch of melancholy. For all the flannelled punks out there, this is a great record to rehearse for the next summer festival season.

2021-05-27,Yara El-Soueidi,6,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",'Set the Fire' Hints at Kandle's Full Potential,,"There's been a resurgence of empowering, sensual music from female musicians as of late. From Lana Del Rey's  Norman Fucking Rockwell!  to Helena Deland's  Someone New  and Billie Eilish's recent single ""Your Power"", women have been reclaiming the narrative around their sexuality and relationships using their voices.  Kandle  aims to follow in these footsteps with her latest album,  Set the Fire , though she still has some work to do before making the same type of impact.     Set the Fire  is meant to be heavily inspired by cabaret and film noir aesthetics, and single ""Honey Trap"" (and accompanying music video) proves it with laser precision. Her distinct voice is luscious, warm and beautiful. It drips, well, like honey. The arrangements, however, serve her influences better than they serve her.     Throughout  Set the Fire , Kandle struggles to find her identity. As the album riffles through genres like cabaret, crooner and even Americana (on closing track ""Vampire""), she comes off more like a tribute artist rather than herself. With ""Lock and Load,"" she goes directly for the James Bond song and ends up sounding exactly like Adele on ""Skyfall."" ""No Good"" could be mistaken for an Amy Winehouse cover right from her first notes.     This being said, it is on ""Cathedral,"" co-written with  Half Moon Run 's Devon Portielje, where she finds her voice. Kandle eases through this song and delivers the chorus with power and assertiveness. The song matches her beautiful voice, which becomes raspy when she implores death to take her instead of the one she loves: ""I'm thinking I should give up / I'm thinking, have I done enough? / It feels like a big mistake / Just to sit around and wait / But I don't know, I don't know how long it takes.""     Set the Fire  hints at Kandle's full potential. She has all the tools to take her rightful place as one of Canada's most acclaimed and internationally known singer-songwriters. The album sets up all of the parts of Kandle's influences — future releases will hopefully provide ample opportunity for her to transcend them.

If there's anything the past few years have proven, it's that even the threat of upheaval can send anyone into an anxious fit.     Rostam Batmanglij  is no stranger to change. As a member of  Vampire Weekend , he was once a poster child for late-aughts indie rock and the hipsterfication of Brooklyn. Now, the multi-instrumentalist, producer and songwriter is a Los Angeles-based free agent, collaborating with anyone that suits his artistic muse, a transition roughly the equivalent of ditching your family and starting a new business. By all accounts, the change did him well and he still sees the kids on weekends.    In-between, Batmanglij will also occasionally dip his toe into his solo career, the latest installment of which puts change front and centre. ""Is it just changephobia that makes you scared of the future in front of ya?"" he sings on the album's title track and emotional core. ""Is it just changephobia that makes us scared of doing what we should?""    As with many of the album's tracks, it catches the protagonist in moments in which choices need to be made: do they accept stasis or make a move? Whether the decision in question concerns something as small as a personal relationship or as big as climate change, Batmanglij's message seems to be the same: lean in and hold on.     2017's  Half-Life  was Batmanglij's official debut under his own name, but next to  Changephobia , it feels like a tentative half-step. Musically, the new record is a low-key flex, with Batmanglij showcasing both his production and songwriting skills. He's not a flashy producer. Like his work on HAIM's  Women in Music Pt. III  last year (Danielle Haim pays him back by playing drums on ""These Kids We Knew""), the arrangements never get too busy, with plenty of space given for the instruments — almost all of which are played by Batmanglij — to breathe. ""Bio18,"" one of the record's highlights, is driven by a palette of keys, hand drums and baritone sax courtesy of unsung MVP Henry Solomon, whose dulcet runs fill the spaces once occupied by Batmanglij's beloved harpsichord.    A big part of Vampire Weekend's initial appeal was how out of step their songs were with indie music at-large. Batmanglij can take at least partial credit for that, and in the 13 years since, he's only sharpened his style. His languid vocal delivery is often at odds with the bright, uptempo songs he writes, like the anxious garage beat that drives ""Kinney."" But the juxtaposition is never jarring. He grounds any left-of-centre production or writing choice he makes, like the sudden tempo shifts in ""Next Thing.""    Whether in his work with other artists (such as Charli XCX, Clairo, Carly Rae Jepsen) or his short-lived  Discovery  project with Ra Ra Riot's Wesley Miles, there is an ineffable quality to Batmanglij's songs that make them feel uniquely his.  Changephobia  might not necessarily win over skeptics, but it's the most coherent vision — lyrically and sonically — of Rostam as a solo artist so far.

Building on a solid foundation of sludge, hardcore and grindcore, Yautja have created a record that is familiar yet new at the same time.    Yautja's greatest strength is their chemistry as a band and their ability to play off one another. Songs like ""Tethered"" and ""Before the Foal"" have plenty of jerky tempo changes throughout, befitting the album's title, creating an uneasy listening experience. This is never more apparent than on ""Catastrophic,"" which emphasizes different accents to create a sensation of constant reinvention. These changes allow for Yautja to take some unprecedented risks in their music that keep their heavy music sounding fresh and interesting from start to finish.    The album features plenty of highlights from each member of the band, but everything sonically resolves around drumming on  The Lurch . Tyler Coburn's skill in utilizing various drumbeats within a song allows the band to do so much more with less. With tracks like ""The Weight"" and ""The Spectacle,"" his alterations allow the band to be more unpredictable with their songwriting and to change the mood of a song without leaving a riff. On ""Undesirables,"" Coburn's fills and rhythms both push and pull the band's momentum on a song built on a singular idea.     The Lurch  infuses new life into sludge and grindcore tropes through unorthodox grooves. Yautja have made their collective chemistry their greatest asset in a way that makes familiar subgenres of heavy music new and unpredictable.  The Lurch  may be considered the band's finest work in their catalogue, and once again set the standards for their future work incredibly high.

It's often difficult for any musician to step out of the shadow of their group successes, so it's reassuring then that Russell's technical debut is an extremely generous project, in both talent and depth.    From the outset,  Outside Child  is a record steeped in resilience and healing — and a celebration of both, through events such as the abuse she experienced as a child in Montreal to the birth of her daughter. Take the opener, named after her hometown: ""Oh you Cathedrals / Your shadows felt like / loving arms / I was your child, Montreal / You would not let me come to harm."" Russell asks difficult questions of her traumas, and while the answers aren't linear, they're no less than cathartic, even redemptive.    It's the birth of her daughter that acts as the emotional lynchpin of the album. One gets the sense that everything Russell has been through pales in comparison to the redeeming power of that act. This belief is most potent on ""Nightflyer"": ""I am the mother of the evening star / I am the love that conquers all.""    Russell displays many talents over the course of the album's 11 tracks, but her voice may be her most versatile tool. It's hard to pick out just one moment as a showcase yet the refrain on ""Runner,"" assisted by Yola, is certainly a highlight in taking dark subject matter and allowing it to transcend to, as she sings, ""deliverance.""    Beyond the obvious quality of her vocals, Russell is also a veritable shapeshifter as she adapts to the needs of each track, whether that's seamlessly incorporating multi-part harmonies on ""Poison Arrow"" or the triumphant crooning of ""Persephone."" On ""Hy-Brasil,"" what begins in an acid rock wash translates to a masterful grasp of melody and storytelling from Russell, with little more than a pounding drum straight out of the mountains as guidance. Close your eyes and it's the shortest of stretches to imagine this sung around a campfire out in the wild, with no one else but the stars for company.     Outside Child  as a whole exhibits a lust for life in spite of its trials. Closer ""Joyful Motherfuckers"" asks its listeners where the self-same have gone ""now that this world is almost done."" Russell doesn't have an answer. In spite of that apocalyptic portent, you're left hopeful, with the impression that you'll find them nonetheless.

The seeds were sown during an initial meeting between the two in 2018, when both discovered they had very similar tastes in music, further quickened by a visit from Clyde to Albino's country home in 2019, and completed whilst whiling away the hours last year.  Blue Blue Blue  serves up an offering of nine emotive tracks, of which two were penned by Albino with the remainder being covers of some of the duo's favourite tracks from years gone by.    Kicking off with Blind Willie McTell's ""You Were Born to Die"", the tone is set early as Clyde and Albino present a predominantly stripped down, minimalist approach throughout. With the simple addition of an acoustic guitar and a tambourine, bluesy original ""Been Worryin'"" showcases the pair's ability to blend their voices effectively. Albino's more understated, soulful vocalizations match well with Clyde's eccentric vocal acrobatics often throughout the record. Other standout tracks include the Carter Family classic ""Hello Stranger,"" which almost sounds like a madcap Moldy Peaches tribute, a sincere take on Bob Dylan's ""Girl from the North Country"" and an appropriately reverent version of Woody Guthrie's ""Pastures of Plenty."" The pair are at their best when putting a bluesy spin on folkier numbers.    Clyde and Albino have put together a set of tunes that showcase their talents as arrangers while giving ample opportunity to demonstrate their own unique vocal talents. With a rootsy flavour conveyed by the stripped-down palette,  Blue Blue Blue  is built on the firm foundation of like-minded individuals that have stepped out and taken adequate risks — though they don't break new ground, they approach each track with plenty of respect.

2021-05-19,Stephan Boissonneault,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Yoo Doo Right Earn Their Spot Among Montreal Post-Rock Royalty with 'Don't Think You Can Escape Your Purpose',,"A droning mechanical chord strum oscillates next to a war drum beat and soon after, a synth line opens the gates for a monolithic wall of sound. It's as if  Yoo Doo Right  have created a universe out of thin air, only to quickly and violently tear it down. It showcases the immense control the Montreal-based psychedelic post-rockers flex on their debut full-length,  Don't Think You Can Escape Your Purpose .    The album is the perfect accompaniment for getting lost in a city, with twists and turns that tease the brain and put the listener into an esoteric daze. There are traces of  Animals -era Pink Floyd, Sunn O))), Popul Vuh and plenty of shoegaze titans on this eight-track album. Yoo Doo Right show they are masters of composition as each song beautifully bleeds into one another.    The jumpy, hallucinatory ""Marché Des Vivants"" evokes a calming and euphoric trance, while the repeated vocals of ""Back up / You're moving too fast"" in the almighty (and brilliantly named) ""The Moral Compass of a Self-Driving Car"" recalls several of the best scenes of the early '60s, moving from heavy, fuzz-filled mayhem to discreet, pillowy psychedelia. The title track begins like something on the Black Angels'  Passover  with a dark and menacing post-rock outro, while ""Join, Be Curst"" melds Persian scales with doom metal atmospherics thanks to heavy bends and massive drums.    Yoo Doo Right have collaborated with local post-rock luminaries Godspeed You! Black Emperor, toured with Japanese psych wizards Acid Mothers Temple and taken their name from a Can song.  Don't Think You Can Escape Your Purpose  proves that they can sit comfortably amongst their heroes.

2021-05-19,Alex Hudson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Nicholas Krgovich's 'This Spring' Is a Beautiful Tribute to Both Veda Hille and Himself,,"Tribute albums are normally reserved for the likes of, say, Leonard Cohen or David Bowie, but  Nicholas Krgovich  has subverted the form by covering 16 songs by fellow Vancouver singer-songwriter  Veda Hille . A big fish in a small pond, Hille is well-known in the Vancouver arts community, but not much beyond that. If you frequent the Cultch and the East Van Panto, you almost certainly know her; if you're not sure what those things are, you might not.    Krgovich recorded  This Spring: Songs by Veda Hille  as a pandemic project last year, at a time when — like so many of us — he found himself with a lot of time on his hands and a sudden penchant for introspection.  He was a huge Hille fan as a teenager , so re-immersing himself in her songs was a way to explore his own past.    While tribute albums tend to be an exercise in novelty, with artists putting their own unique spins on familiar material, the songs on  This Spring  are likely to be new to most listeners. And if you're familiar with Krgovich's work but not Hille's, you might never know these are covers, since the smooth new age textures and R&B emoting belong to the same sonic world as albums like  ""Ouch""  or  Philadelphia  (by  Shabason, Krgovich & Harris ).    But even though it can be tough to make out Hille's theatrical, folk-cabaret imprint on these arrangements, her distinctive lyrics cut through. The haunting ""Plants"" sounds almost like a child's commentary on a horticultural textbook, with plainspoken lines like, ""The daffodil is a wild flower / The dandelion is a weed / The bluebell is a pretty flower / The holly is a prickly tree / We once did grow wild as apples / Some people are poisoned more easily than others.""    On ""Burst/Neighbourhood Song,"" Krgovich mashes up two of Hille's songs from different eras, name-checking Vancouver's Pender Street and culminating in a gorgeous, detail-rich tour of the local community: ""A junkie is a person your neighbourhood / k.d. lang is a person in your neighbourhood / And Benny and family are in the neighbourhood / And all the nuns are people in your neighbourhood / Public dreams are pockets in your neighbourhood / Someone stole my recycling box in the neighbourhood / So I stole somebody else's recycling box in the neighbourhood.""    These curious lyrics stick out in a nagging, slightly jarring way — they are so frank and unadorned, not the kind of thoughts usually sung in a smooth, deep croon like Krgovich's. They give  This Spring  the feeling of an inner monologue, a sense of privacy that's broken beautifully when Hille herself sings the closing title track. It adds up to a beautiful tribute to an under-appreciated songwriter — but also a gorgeous celebration of Krgovich's own history, and the music that shaped his sound when he was still a teenager searching for a voice.

2021-05-20,Matt Bobkin,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",PACKS Plant Seeds of Hope in an Apocalypse on 'Take the Cake',,"With everything going on these days, nihilism is at an all-time high. Today's young people have endured multiple recessions, the climate crisis and unstable housing markets, and yet are still expected to consume, produce and participate in these systems for little sustainable incentive.  PACKS  tell these stories well — their songs are littered with ragged bodies and torn-up urban wastelands, overrun by capitalistic tendencies and endless self-doubt.  Take the Cake , the Toronto band's debut album, makes the case that, despite everything going on, there's still something worth fighting and hoping for.    Disarming listeners with a palette of sounds that merge laidback rock landscapes with grungy grit, Madeline Link's lyrics are jagged and abrupt, with abstract lines fused together by vividly visceral imagery. Deciphering deeper meanings may prove difficult (particularly as filtered through her languid drawl), but the endlessly listenable, breezy rock tunes encourage plenty of exploration, and any efforts will be handsomely rewarded. Link's words convey Cronenbergian body horror by way of Modest Mouse's suburban alienation. ""Hold My Hand"" sets a heist movie scene to the sounds of the Inbreds: ""Cut my head and lost the money / Backed into a pickup runnin' way / Strewn across the streetcar tracks / Voyeurs drinkin' Laker Ice yell, 'Hey! / You coulda killed that girl!'""    Other moments are more upfront, like the Sonic Youth-like fuzzed-out menace of ""Silvertongue"" and ""Holy Water."" Early standout ""Clingfilm"" finds Link and company firing on all cylinders. The track kicks off like a nursery rhyme post-nuclear apocalypse: ""My guts are wrapped in clingfilm, my guts are wrapped up tight / And if you're gonna put me in your backpack, I will putrefy."" To hammer it home, Link then snarls, ""And that's a promise."" She stuffs a whole layer of unsettling ambience in the slight gap between her double-tracked vocals.    Despite the band's self-styled slacker rock description and the thick, permeable fog of exhaustion that lingers throughout the record, it's clear that Link and her band care a great deal, at least enough to fill each song with plenty of nuance and little details. Mewling electric guitars graze playfully across the acoustic guitar-led ""Hangman,"" while piano accents add old-school colour to the materialist musings of ""New TV."" Link finds ways to be interesting even when describing life's little ubiquities, as on ""Two Hands"": ""Just like a  Simpsons  sunset, everyone in town says 'Hi.'""    But throughout all the arrangements, Link is more than capable of commanding attention on her own, and she knows it. Understated closer ""U Can Wish All U Want"" ends the album on a hopeful note, with acoustic guitars and an intimate chorus of multi-tracked background vocals: ""Not yet a butterfly / Crawling 'round the neighbourhood / Let's stick together / I don't quite know my way around just yet."" Though the world may be approaching uninhabitability, Link and her peers are still driven by a need to learn and grow.  Take the Cake  seeks out a tiny patch of fertile soil and plants a seed in hopes that it could maybe, hopefully, one day bloom — because there's too much worth experiencing not to try.

2021-05-20,Daniel Sylvester,6,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Lydia Ainsworth Gets Lost Among 'Sparkles & Debris',,"For anyone who attempts to dissect  Lydia Ainsworth 's art, be it her handful of LPs, her select movie scores, or her arresting music videos, it probably needs to be understood that she knows exactly what she's doing. An artist as seasoned and highly educated (with degrees in music composition from McGill and New York University) as Ainsworth doesn't just throw things against the wall to see what will stick.    It's this exact theory that makes  Sparkles & Debris , the Toronto musician's fourth full-length, such a head-scratcher. Ainsworth spent her first two records beefing up her gorgeously swirling take on baroque dance pop, adding levels of lushness to 2017's  Darling of the Afterglow  before stripping it all back on 2019's  Phantom Forest  without losing any of the drama that defines her craft. But across the 11 tracks and 34 minutes that make up her latest, Ainsworth seems completely lost at times.    Opening track ""Parade"" takes on a slick sophisti-pop sound with so much fastidiousness and accuracy that it loses all personality and any sense of urgency, while ""Forever"" finds Ainsworth crafting a rhythmically dense melody that attempts to travel down the same avenues as '70s Bee Gees but runs out of steam at the chorus, right where the brothers Gibb would soar. The jittery ""Cosmic Dust"" comes off as a paint-by-numbers 21st-century R&B track but ends up sounding much less adventurous or candid than anything by Solange or Janelle Monáe. Her cover of Chic's iconic ""Good Times"" is delivered in a slowed-down, brooding way that it comes off more like something you'd find in the dredges of YouTube than from someone with her pedigree.    As the second half of  Sparkles & Debris  begins to unravel, Ainsworth's tracks begin to sound more relaxed, less forced and much more authentic. ""Halo of Fire"" skitters along nicely, layering echoed Prince-type guitar solos with busy vocals and a perfectly-placed moody spoken word. The unvarnished ""Queen of Darkness"" shows Ainsworth breaking her phrasings into sharper bites, creating a more urgent sound than anything else found across the LP, while ""All I Am"" is a ambient piece that displays just how well she's able to embrace new age and folktronica.    Throughout  Sparkles & Debris , Lydia Ainsworth clearly attempts to move her craft forward. And although she howls on the title track, ""I've got nothing to prove,"" the tracks that fail to connect with the listener tell a completely different story.

2021-05-20,Eric Hill,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Fly Pan Am Return to Their Origins on 'Frontera',,"In writing a score for dance performance, Montreal's  Fly Pan Am  also have succeeded in wrapping back around to their origins just over two decades ago. Along with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Do Make Say Think, the four piece formed the early core of Constellation Records' lineup. Their earliest releases featured an aggressive blend of progressive rock, Krautrock, minimalism, noise and just a slight dusting of Franco-pop. They often relied on tension that came from opening wide melodic spaces to draw in the listener before locking the door behind them and indulging very extended repetitive sections drawn from the Tony Conrad and Dream Syndicate playbook.    Though Fly Pan Am went on hiatus in 2005, band members' participation in projects such as Feu Thérèse and Avec Le Soleil Sortant De Sa Bouche kept the Fly Pan Am sound fueled and ready, so that when the group reunited to play a one-off show in 2018, a new album quickly followed the next year.  C'est ça  found the group unlocking structures they'd left standing 15 years previously, armed with a modern arsenal of electronics and a skilled producer in the form of Jerusalem in My Heart's Radwan Moumneh. Their signature sound was immediately recognizable, but harder and leaner in performance and with a willingness to use the studio as an instrument, finding tension this time in the edits as much as the interplay.    New album  Frontera  was born out of a collaboration between the band and choreographer Dana Gingras from Montreal's Animals of Distinction troupe. In the liner notes, Gingras describes the project's focus as a counter to ""an advancing frontier of knowledge and control, monitoring movement, defining identities and gathering data."" Workshopped with the band and the ensembles' ten dancers, the project eventually premiered in November of 2019, with Fly Pan Am as a live band onstage for the performance.    The group haven't really deviated from their basic process in crafting this score, however either by design or irony, there are definite boundaries in place that help express the themes but also restrict the musical palette. The two most definitive elements are Félix Morel's drums functioning as both mood and metronome for the bulk of the pieces, and field recordings lending a blurring effect to harder edges in the sound. The temperament of the album swings from straight line certitude expressed with a degree of anger, especially in Jean-Sébastien Truchy's metal-adjacent vocal moments, to a less-definitive exhalation of energies not quite at rest but renewing.    It is a well-conceived and delivered piece of work, but perhaps unavoidably one that feels the absence of its staged elements. The success of the music is marked by the suggestion of spaces left open for reactions and intersections by the dancers and technical direction of the larger production. It does function as a standalone album, perhaps, but not entirely dance-alone.

This difference is most noticeable on ""stuck with silver,"" as the singer-songwriter opens up very slowly, moving from an ethereal sound to a drum-heavy beat that is closer in resemblance to bedroom pop than her usual dark folk.     recollection  is a more mature piece of work. While l i l a still explores sad experiences, she manages to avoid bogging down her songs in despair. Where  Quiet as Fire  was built on dark, sad arrangements,  recollection  is more complex, exploring vivid sounds and compositions. l i l a's voice sounds clearer.

2021-05-25,Papa Minnow,9,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC",Mustafa Honours His Grief Through Beautiful Poetry on 'When Smoke Rises',,"On debut album  When Smoke Rises ,  Mustafa  uses his acclaimed poetic ability to deliver a raw and emotional story about the dangers and hopes of living in Toronto's oldest social housing project, Regent Park. Those same dangers led to the untimely losses of his friends Ali Rizeig and rapper  Smoke Dawg , who was the victim of a  shooting outside of a Toronto nightclub in 2018 . Still dealing with grief, Mustafa uses his gifted poeticism to express his feelings of pain, hurt and hope, and he masterfully crafts it all into a timeless journey for the world to hear.    Album opener ""Stay Alive"" serves as as a window into Mustafa's soul as he elegantly sings over a sombre guitar about the struggles of surviving to see another day. It's in this musical approach that Mustafa is able to harness the immense power of his storytelling as honed through his poetry, which he first earned praise for as a child. Driven by slow-burning, guitar-driven tracks, the album flows gracefully, with more percussive numbers such as ""The Hearse"" providing a nice change of pace.     The 24 year-old musician simultaneously tells the narratives of street rap through uplifting indie folk instrumentals, driven by his beautiful vocals. The most prominent display of this fusion occurs on ""Separate."" Mustafa's lyrics contextualize how street violence claims young lives too soon while being backed by an acoustic guitar that lets his vocals shine through: ""How we're too young to fade away / How we're too young to feel this pain / How we're too young to separate."" It's the best of both worlds that manages to capsize the traditional sailings of what's typically found in both genres.    Throughout this journey, Mustafa shows a great amount of depth and introspection as he deals with the pain of losing loved ones. Some of the album's most moving moments come about when he questions his own existence. On ""Air Forces,"" he ponders, ""To what are we even destined, will we have wives and children or is that not written for you and I?"" The song ""What About Heaven"" reveals thoughts of his friend falling short of God's forgiveness: ""What if you're not forgiven?""    ""Capo"" finds Mustafa struggling to contain his grief from the loss of Smoke Dawg. His fury boils over on ""The Hearse,"" in which he seeks revenge by any means necessary: ""They gon' pay their price in blood and that's on everything I know."" It's a tune that's more reminiscent of a love song, but here it's filled with a softly delivered rage. On ""Ali,"" a pulsing drum emulates the beat of a heart, a testament to Mustafa's creative composition.    He's not alone. Sampha delivers a standout performance on ""Capo,"" as he sings to a roaring crescendo that elevates the song's back half. On ""Come Back,"" James Blake croons on a fading ethereal beat that closes out the album like a candle flame flickering before being blown out.     When Smoke Rises  is a succinct and well-crafted album that serves to tell the story of Mustafa's pain, grief and loss in way that honours his unique voice. Mustafa manages to transcend genres while remaining true to himself as he navigates his emotional trauma.

2021-05-25,Sydney Brasil,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Black Midi Modernize Jazz Fusion on 'Cavalcade',,"There were many directions  Black Midi  could have taken to move forward from their acclaimed debut, 2019's  Schlagenheim . The sense of mystery surrounding the London-bred post-punks hasn't waned since they burst onto the scene only a few years ago; since then, thousands of people in subreddits and Facebook groups have treated every move the band makes as an Easter egg.    This pressure cooker resulted in a record moulded by fresh influences that doesn't sacrifice what made Black Midi so captivating in the first place. The band's exploration of harmonics and addition of saxophone and keys shows their dexterity as songwriters across many genres. This is most evident in comparison to their contemporaries in the south London post-punk scene; where others have used jazz almost timidly, Black Midi pull all the stops to challenge the standard rock format. Because of this,  Cavalcade  is a record that modernizes jazz fusion, evolving it beyond its party yacht past.     The band build on their existing eclecticism by staying true to their essentials while they push their own boundaries. Though Geordie Greep's signature  Schlagenheim  snarl pops up occasionally, his vocals mostly bounce between an earthy croon and the address of an authoritative gospel preacher. In contrast, bassist Cameron Picton's vocal tracks add a softer dimension on exactly the songs that need it. Still, Black Midi's trance-like use of repetition remains strong. ""Slow"" and ""Hogwash and Balderdash"" are filled with galloping vamps that ebb and flow through multiple parts, acting as an older sibling to their earlier works. The band nod to Steely Dan with the soft bossa nova of ""Marlene Dietrich.""  Cavalcade  is a departure inasmuch as it holds onto old charm; it still has edge and abrasion, just in different ways.    That said, the bulk of the album's lustre is in its niceties. In a press release, powerhouse drummer Morgan Simpson gives listeners the sound advice to ""spend some time living in it."" Each listen unlocks a new layer, both musically and in the album's narrative of a dark procession. Where there's layering, there is drama. There isn't anything about the album that's understated, so it takes some time for its nuances and subtleties to sink in.    It's in this way that Black Midi keep forging their own brand of avant-punk, intricate and attention grabbing in its mission.  Cavalcade  is an album of extremes, fluctuating between lounging wizardry and an angular, prog-rock nightmare. It's smart and well-calculated, expressing their range as musicians. Most importantly, it's the best path forward to keep speculators on their toes.

2021-05-11,Leslie Ken Chu,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Devours' 'Escape from Planet Devours' Is an Electro-Pop Quest to Rebuild Confidence,,"Escape from Planet Devours  was born from a nervous breakdown. Jeff Cancade, a.k.a. Vancouver electro-pop gaylien  Devours , spent the pandemic isolated and unemployed. His already waning obsession with ""making it"" as a musician died as the entire industry plunged into uncertainty. Disillusioned and depressed, music stopped being fun, and he nearly quit.    Throughout this time, he continued struggling with body image issues. They largely stemmed from his experiences among gay communities that worshipped at the altar of hypermasculinity. On  Escape , he's extricated himself from the resultant insecurity, shame and guilt by transforming into the superhero he always wished he saw, one who didn't conform to the beefcake ideal he grew up watching in wrestling rings and '90s action blockbusters like  Escape from New York ,  Escape from L.A. ,  True Lies , and  Die Hard with a Vengeance . Cancade no longer seeks acceptance or outside validation. Instead, he's betting on himself because he has nothing left to lose.    Part of the gamble included launching his own label, surviving the game.  Escape , his third album as Devours (he also records Hollywood-inspired ""glambient"" music as  the Golden Age of Wrestling ) arrives via this new imprint.  Escape  is also his first double album, and its filled with busy, unpredictable, and relentlessly catchy pop that sends 8-bit video game sounds flying like sparks. But don't be mistaken: Cancade is darker and more uncompromising than ever in his quest to rebuild his confidence and sense of self-love. As he sings on the cavernous groover ""Nomi's Got Heat,"" ""I've worked too hard / To be stuck in a rut / Well, baby, I'm back / And I'm bitter as fuck.""    Cancade holds himself accountable for his misplaced priorities on ""Poltergeist."" Over an industrial thrum and nervous, skidding electronics, he wonders, ""Did I do it for love? / Was I in it for fame? / I should have trusted my gut / I have no one to blame."" He stops trying to keep up appearances and relinquishes unrealistic ideals on ""Death Is a B-Side"": ""I just wanna have fun / Shut the world out and pretend that I'm young"" and ""Fuck the gym / Let's get fat together.""    The bewildering ""Yoshi's Revenge"" finds him cutting a toxic, misogynistic ex out of his life. With absurdist humour, the song comes off as a bit of free association when he repeats ""drugs"" 16 times then asks, ""What is punk? / You need to adapt / Counterculture"" over a crowded, squelching beat. Musically, ""Yoshi's Revenge"" is a primer for ""Feckless Abandon."" ""I'm bald, gay, fat, and depressed / How the fuck are you? / I resent you for your looks and your natural charm,"" he vents. He refuses to ""live like a victim,"" and because why not, he hurls a pot shot: ""You were only a flame 'cause I'm in love with your dad."" Yet the championship title for most confrontational song goes to the prowling ""B__E__T__A (Scientology Remix),"" where he lashes out: ""Protect yourself / Run and hide / Before my toxic, fragile ego eats you alive.""    Devours is best known for club bangers, but Cancade flexes other muscles on Escape. ""Grape Crush"" offers ascendance, meandering along an unadorned keyboard line before each percussive splat and melodic note crashes inwards like a tree felled across a walking trail. Listening to ""Two Kids"" is like taking a full-breath, head-clearing repose from the album's unhinged pop.    Devours' shackles are off. He's calloused and smells like smoke because he's been through fire. As frustrated as Cancade was going into  Escape , he's free now. From this point on, he's moving forward and upward along his own path. For those feeling depressed or hopeless,  Escape from Planet Devours  is the rocket fuel for their exit towards a brighter future.

Two years after the release of their last EP,  The Professional ,  Future Lovers  is a worthwhile sequel.    ""Bad Behaviour"" starts with a riff that nods to the Clash's ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" before launching into a singalong-worthy anthem that's entirely the Beaches' signature sound, down to the call and response vocals between lead vocalist Jordan Miller and her bandmates.    True to the band's Toronto roots, the EP is filled with lyrics that reference recognizable local landmarks and figures including the Summerville pool, Mississauga, the King West neighbourhood, the Bovine Sex Club and Goodbye Honolulu member Emmett Webb. In ""Blow Up,"" Miller evokes better times as she recalls a night out in her hometown.    Always playful, the Beaches have never been afraid to talk about their sexuality (""He's whisperin' my name into an empty space / Hoping that I'll hear him when he says / 'I wish we were alone'"" on ""Slow Mo""), being young and having fun (""I wanna dance until I'm kicked out, don't you?"" on ""Blow Up""), and succeeding in the face of haters (""Boys in the band, just like their dads, give us advice on punk rock / Said we'd do better if we quit writing about all the girl stuff"" on ""Let's Go"").    The EP closes with the keyboard-driven ballad, ""You Don't Owe Me Anything,"" that backs an intimate voicemail message from Miller as the guitars and drums ramp up for an epic instrumental finale, before fading out to a satisfying end.      Future Lovers  exudes confident, unapologetic, femme fatale energy and cements the Beaches as one of Canada's greatest modern rock acts.

2021-05-12,Luke Pearson,8,"POP AND ROCK,EP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",fanclubwallet's Specifics Are Personal but the Vibes Are Relatable on 'Hurt Is Boring' EP,,"Written during and about the pandemic (with the added stress of a 10-month recovery from an unrelated health flare-up), fanclubwallet's debut EP,  Hurt Is Boring , is a testament to the creative benefits of enforced solitude. Ottawa-based musician Hannah Judge's five-track release is a deeply-felt — but not necessarily depressing — slice of bedroom indie-pop dealing with experiences many of us are likely familiar with these days, including isolation, boredom and the rehashing of minor events that take on looming proportions in our memories. The specifics may be personal, but the vibes are relatable. Produced by grade-school friend Michael Watson and recorded with guitars and lo-fi synths kicking around the house,  Hurt Is Boring  is a friendly and unpretentious mix of indie folk and pop sensibilities.    There's something distinctly punk about the imagery of this scruffy, worn-out wallet (the project is named after a vintage  Dennis the Menace  piece that once belonged to her dad), and while certain aspects of  Hurt Is Boring  definitely reflect a folk-punk aesthetic (basic guitar chords, raw lyrical honesty, gang vocals at one point), there's also a lot of delicate synth work going on that broadens the album's palette nicely, setting it apart from the standard open-hearted strum-fests of so much acoustic punk. The swirling lead that swims out of the darkness to match Judge's vocal phrasing on the title track is especially striking, an unexpected burst of warm, Casio-toned colour that offsets the heavy sentiment of the song.     It's a contrast that seeps into a lot of the album — even the ominously titled ""Car Crash in G Major"" features a downright bouncy synth line that accompanies lyrics about fiery wreckage. It's all held together by Judge's easygoing charm however (""C'mon Be Cool,"" a disarming ode to polite non-engagement is another highlight), drawing you into the homey, living room vibes of the album with ease. Things open up after the swift, economical punch of these two singles with ""Flew Away,"" a more exploratory track that's ultimately the most rewarding on the album, its delayed focal point tying everything together with a dreamy piano-assisted outro.    Judge keeps things tight overall, with a distinct lack of filler. By the time the title track closes the album, with its clear-eyed rejection of the banality of painlessness in favour of the complexity of real life, you'll find yourself comforted by the knowledge that we'll hopefully all be living at least freer lives by the time fanclubwallet's next effort hits.

2021-05-12,Jonathan St. Michael,8,"JAZZ,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Sons of Kemet Contextualize the Past on 'Black to the Future',,"In many respects, jazz has acted as a vehicle in which musicians can draw from a vast well of historical and contextual memory, transforming their sound to encompass elements of the past, present, and future. Shabaka Hutchings, saxophonist and bandleader of UK jazz group  Sons of Kemet , understands the significance that history holds within the realm of music. Having played in several other jazz ensembles, such as Afrofuturist group  the Ancestors , and even with  Sun Ra Arkestra , Hutchings' work has made him a hot topic within music circles. His recent work with Sons of Kemet has been met with critical acclaim for its unique blend of Caribbean and South African genres, with an acute awareness of current culture and politics.    Following their acclaimed 2018 release  Your Queen is a Reptile , Sons of Kemet's latest LP,  Black to the Future , is a rich and musically diverse exploration of the frustration and anger that accompany Black identity. The album symbolizes a cosmological journey inwards, urging listeners to look towards the past in order to provide a better understanding of the future.    Fitting well within the themes of the album,  Black to the Future  draws influence from a wide variety of historically Black genres, namely Afrobeat, dub and grime. And while the band's influences can be heard quite clearly, the album by no means feels uninspired — it simply highlights Hutchings' ability to create varied arrangements while calling back to the signature sounds that have helped create an open environment for him to explore.     Black to the Future  begins and ends with harrowing spoken word provided by musician and poet Joshua Idehen, whose vocals are backed by a beautiful arrangement of brass and wind instrumentation. Idehen's words are teeming with emotion, providing a poetic narrative to how the past contextualizes the present and future; ""I am Field Negro now / I do not want your equality, it was never yours to give me, and even then it was too minor."" The connection of the past to the present is sentiment echoed throughout  Black to the Future , and provides a poignant opening statement on the direction the album aims to take.     Hutchings' compositions on  Black to the Future  are diverse and heavy, containing grooves that delve deep into rhythmic jams. The percussion on these arrangements are intricate and hypnotizing, providing a stable framework for Hutchings' instrumentation to work in full effect. And through wielding these instrumentations,  Black to the Future  masterfully elicits the raw emotion that accompanies history and identity. Tracks such as ""In Remembrance of Those Fallen"" and ""Envision Yourself Levitating"" beautifully capture these feelings of pain and sorrow.     The meaning in  Black to the Future  is not universal, but instead is shaped by the cultural context of the listener. Hutchings' compositions are shaped by his own understanding of the past, and in turn reflect a more profound interpretation of music and its relation with history. The music is raw, melodic and explosive, and captures the inner reflection one must undertake to properly envision the future.

2021-05-13,Chris Bryson,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,MUSIC",Arcade Fire/Bell Orchestre Violinist Sarah Neufeld Evokes Emotions with Virtuosic Skill on 'Detritus',,"The word ""detritus"" evokes disintegration, debris and things wearing away.  Sarah Neufeld 's  Detritus  works through its own process of renewal, one that's as much a meditation as it is a summoning.    Neufeld trained as a dancer in her youth, and like that vibrant, kinetic, physically demanding art form, she uses her violin and cinematic soundscapes to span and express a range of emotions through reflective tones and sharp abstract shapes. The finesse in her skill is remarkably precise and moving, often weaving fine details into split seconds, and knowing when to hold back and let space and texture weigh in.     Detritus  — the third solo album from the member of  Arcade Fire  and  Bell Orchestre  — originated from a 2015 collaboration between Neufeld and dancer/choreographer Peggy Baker. The collaboration lit a spark between the pair, and they decided to do it again with a full-length show called  who we are in the dark , where Neufeld and her Arcade Fire bandmate Jeremy Gara performed violin and drums alongside Baker's small troupe of choreographed dancers. The result of their second outing led to Neufeld reimagining the show's music for an album. Taking the work into the studio, she was joined again by Gara, who performs drums and synth, with Bell Orchestre's Pietro Amato on French horn and Stuart Bogie on flute and saxophone, who — along with Neufeld's foot pedal bass synth — amass vast, resonant worlds around her keen violin.    Neufeld's virtuoso musicianship is able to evoke a rich range of emotions, from mournful spells to fervent flutters and everything in between. Throughout the album, her wordless vocals help elevate songs like ""The Top"" and ""With Love and Blindness,"" adding an ethereal element to the latter's hypnotic conjuring and the former's moody flittering through anxious and alleviating motifs. In ""Tumble Down the Undecided,"" the album's longest track at nearly ten minutes, drones swell as Gara's drumming provides a thunderous heft. Neufeld's violin jumps, skips and seesaws frantically, casting vibrant waves and bursts. The song's chase-scene momentum winds in and out of intense passages before climaxing in a raging, freeing lustre. Her instrument draws weeping lines through the record's opener, ""Stories,"" an otherworldly dreamscape with whirring and undulating tones around Neufeld's soothing vocals. ""Shed Your Dear Heart"" builds on a sharply swaying violin pattern with a rhythmic heartbeat, nebulous accents and puffing woodwinds, and the album closes with the title track, a pensive wash of gleaming strings and drones.    While staying within the realms of the musical ground covered on her past solo efforts,  Detritus  presents a heady progression of Neufeld's work, and finds her exquisitely spirited and expressive minimalism fitting nicely into new creative spaces.

2021-05-13,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Lary Kidd Is at the Top of His Game on 'Le poids des livres',,"Lary Kidd 's signature adlib ""Jeune homme!"" speaks to the young rapper's career start as a founding member of formidable Quebec trio  Loud Lary Ajust . The group's success sparked a regional rap renaissance, which culminated with the live realization of their braggadocious lyrics when Lary opened for Loud's grandiose 2019 Centre Bell arena performance.    On the solo tip, Lary has traversed between grim delirium on his 2017 debut  Contrôle  to the radical chic stylings of 2019's  Surhomme . His most recent output,  Le poids des livres , is a veritable tour de force that sees the MC simultaneously grounding himself in tradition while reasserting his trendsetting sound. A short yet impactful EP, it invites comparisons with Griselda's grimy approach, but sets itself apart because of Lary's stoic presence and slick wordplay.    Kidd takes the listener for a stroll down memory lane on the opening ""Metro Vendôme,"" and he opens up about his moral dilemmas as we follow his drug running route on ""De mon âme."" The soulful samples from producer Ajust give a structure to the project and allow Lary to freely adjust his cadence to the beats. We get a taste of powder dreams on ""Ville des anges"" as Lary's inherent bravado perfectly matches the '80s soundscape. From the throwback phrases to the metaphors meanings weaved into each bar, it is clear that Lary is in his bag and can flex his penmanship effortlessly.    Lead single ""Keys on the Table"" embodies the overarching aesthetic that Lary and Ajust established throughout the project.  Le poids des livres  is sustained by the subtle interplay between the rapper's dense yet relatable lyrics and the vocal samples' nostalgic mood-setting. Lary positions himself somewhere between Pusha T's cocaine rap delivery and Westside Gunn's curatorial wizardry.    Ultimately, this EP is the potent result of two artists who have worked together for years and consciously decided to do the type of music they love to listen to. With a successful clothing brand (Officiel) under his direction, and having earned the respect of Quebec's rap aficionados, Lary has nothing to prove, so he ensures continuity by crafting a more-than-solid outing with a level of quality that cannot be ignored.    In one fell swoop, Lary silences the naysayers and feeds his hungry following with a project that will hopefully make the industry formally recognize his contribution to the culture.

2021-05-17,Matt Bauer,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Jayda G's DJ-Kicks Mix Is Eclectic, Invigorating and Well-Deserved",,"When  Jayda G  dropped her  Both of Us / Are U Down  EP last summer, the Grand Forks, BC-bred DJ and producer's paean to vintage Chicago and early house was the call to the dance floor that a glum world needed — even if we couldn't dance together. Almost a year and a historic Grammy nomination later, the artist born Jayda Guy remains a beam of soulful energy, a spirit that resonates throughout her invigorating and well-deserved mix for the 78th instalment of the revered  DJ-Kicks  series.    Music sites like Napster were Guy's portal into music and music history, and her mix is an expansively curated set that clocks in at just over 70 minutes. Light of the World's ""London Town"" kicks off the set with a brisk slice of early 1980s Brit-funk and a shout out to Guy's adopted hometown, its chant of ""New York, Chicago, LA, Munich, and Japan"" foreshadowing of some of the global grooves in store for later on.     Rare cuts are favoured early in the mix with Aged in Harmony's sumptuous 1978 single ""You're A Melody,"" Universal Togetherness Band's ""More Than Enough,"" Don Blackman's ""Just Can't Stay Away"" and Atmosfear's ""Invasion,"" each tastefully segued together along with the muscular nouveau-Afrobeat of London up-and-comers KOKOROKO's ""Uman,"" while the sensual funk of Royale's ""I Want Your Body"" furthers the syncopated momentum, standing as fine examples of Guy's keen musical knowledge, as well.    Gerry Read's ""90's Prostitution Racket,"" which flips Wish and Fonda Rae's ""Touch Me (All Night Long),"" seamlessly flows into the throbbing deep house of Naomi Daniel's ""Stars (Dos Cult Mix)"" as the set takes a nocturnal and hypnotic turn toward the dance floor with lush original cuts like LNS' ""Bitumen"" and friend Jennifer Loveless' ""In 10,000 Places,"" a joyous high point.     Of course, this is a  DJ-Kicks  set and that means an exclusive new track — and  ""All I Need""  doesn't disappoint. Channeling the infectious optimism of classic disco and house with a slight chill of melancholy, ""All I Need"" is a splendid addition to Guy's already impressive oeuvre.    The mix closes out with the glorious gospel house re-assurance of 250 Lbs. of Blue's ""Rejoice"" and FIT Siegel's transcendent ""Tonite,"" before cooling down with DJ Koze's ""Homesick"" and the breezy blue-eyed soul of Benny Sings' ""Summerlude,"" an inspired breather after a dance floor high. We still can't dance together, but Jayda G's  DJ-Kicks  is the perfect elixir for pandemic lethargy.

2021-05-17,Adam Fink,8,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC",CHAI Add Contemplation to Their Manic Sweetness on 'WINK',,"CHAI  are a whirlwind of a band. The Japanese quartet of identical twins MANA and KANA, YUNA and YUUKI deal in the kind of joyful abandon that seems to be pretty absent in music these days. Known for their raucous live shows that feature the group in matching outfits, partaking in choreographed dance moves and showing off their enviable musicianship, CHAI have become a breath of fresh air in the world of indie music.    When the pandemic hit, CHAI decided to start crafting a new set of songs, something perhaps a bit subtler and more introspective than their previous output. The outcome is their third album,  WINK . While  WINK  may be on the more contemplative side of where the band usually toils, it is still a playful blend of genre-hopping manic sweetness.    Into chiptune? Check out the 8-bit pop of ""PING PONG!"" Contemporary hip-hop? Look no further than ""Maybe Chocolate Chips,"" which features a tight and very smooth guest turn from Chicago rapper Ric Wilson. House music your thing? Listen to the concussed, underwater groove of ""Nobody Knows We Are Fun."" While all this cross-pollination of genres seems like it would make a confusing listen, CHAI have a way of distilling all these disparate influences into something that sounds wholly their own.     Musically, CHAI would've fit in perfectly with the rest of the Grand Royal roster that the Beastie Boys assembled in the 1990s, and they also share a lot of those groups' political acumen. Known in Japan for challenging their listeners to subvert their standards and expectations of beauty and cuteness, on  WINK  they extend their songwriting activism to a much broader global pursuit. Lead single ""ACTION,"" with its harmonized refrain of ""Action is more than words,"" serves as a direct response to seeing the Black Lives Matter protests unfold all over the world in 2020.     Totally original, completely unselfconscious and wonderfully catchy,  WINK  is one of those rare albums that you can throw on anytime and let it guide you on the journey it has laid out before you. Here's hoping that we can all experience this whirlwind live and in-person as soon as possible.

2021-05-17,Vish Khanna,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Mdou Moctar Takes His Peerless Guitar Rock to New Heights on 'Afrique Victime',,"In his native Tamasheq, one of the Tuareg languages, Mahamadou Souleymane (a.k.a.  Mdou Moctar ) sings the following on ""Chismiten"": ""To become a better person, you need to stop being so jealous and insecure / I have observed these qualities and I'm unimpressed.""    In English, on the page, it's stark and simple enough; almost a parental scolding. But from the mouth, mind and soul of one of the greatest guitarists and performers working today, with his incredible band blasting into a groove beneath him and echoing his words, it's transcendent and profound. Such is the case throughout  Afrique Victime , a stunning Mdou Moctar record that shows us sides of the band we've only had glimpses of in the past.     Following 2019's brilliant, psych-tinged breakthrough,  Ilana (The Creator) , lead guitarist Souleymane, rhythm guitarist Ahmoudou Madassane, bassist Michael Coltun and drummer Souleymane Ibrahim again go for a big, rollicking sound, but also take on more acoustic, less frenetic arrangements, showcasing gorgeous melodies and harmonies, which are alluringly hypnotic.    ""Tala Tannam,"" for instance, is so tender, its warmth of expression is almost tangible. The band is busy here, with fingers and various body parts in constant motion to create this inviting, textured sound, but it's also a relatively relaxed mode, where they can coo, ""My love, no matter where I go, you're always on my mind / I treasure you / You know I never want to see you in tears,"" and it comes across focused and sincere.    The devotional and romantic work in tandem with sociopolitical outspokenness. Mdou Moctar represents Agadez, a rural, desert village in Niger. Since making a name for himself and his band, Moctar has done whatever he can to better the material conditions of other Tuareg people and aspiring regional musicians, and that mindset bleeds through  Afrique Victime .    On the stirring title track, he sings: ""From prison to Nobel prize / They ceded to Mandela / Africa is a victim of so many crimes / If we stay silent it will be the end of us / Why is this happening?"" It all sounds so solemnly forlorn, but the song begins with a lightning bolt of guitar before the whole band provides an anthemic, parade march of a jam to match the oratory. Elsewhere, Nigerien political revolutionary and musician Abdallah Ag Oumbadougou is feted on the stirring ""Ya Habibti"" and again on ""Layla,"" which does vaguely (and briefly) interpolate its namesake song's rather famous guitar part, while crying out in anguish for someone by name.    Such nods to Western culture are just that.  Afrique Victime  is a decidedly Tuareg expression, furthering the distinction that Mdou Moctar holds as one of the most exciting, innovative and provocative artists to emerge from the area. Beyond that, he and his band are making truly tremendous guitar rock in a manner that is peerless in this era, and from anywhere on the globe.

Her array of previous bands perhaps explains why McMichael arrives on her debut solo album sounding fully-formed. It's the mark of a mature songwriter who has honed a graceful pop-rock style that balances emotional rawness with carefully considered songcraft.     Waves  sounds like it could have come from any time in the past 50 years, like the late-album highlight ""Montreal,"" which relates an achingly nostalgic story about visiting the titular city over a chord progression reminiscent of ""Crimson and Clover."" ""She Makes Men,"" with its quavering guitar tremolo straight outta the '60s and the effortless vocal delivery of Stevie Nicks, is similarly vintage. (That said, the lyric ""she was a lesbian"" refreshingly sounds absolutely nothing like classic rock.)    Elsewhere, McMichael dabbles in '80s-friendly sounds: ""Out the Window"" has the blippy arpeggiator and brassy synths of classic new wave (think Duran Duran's ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" or Gary Numan's ""Cars""), and ""I Won't Stop"" has a surging dance-rock beat and thrumming post-punk bassline.    With hymnal harmonies and effortless vocal runs, ""Love Is On"" recalls the decades-old moments when pop balladry first collided with soul, while lyrics like ""I left Toronto / Probably for the best / Lost my mind in England / Headed home for some rest"" situate the song firmly within McMichael's world.    The album's consistency only falters on final track ""Can't at All,"" a beat-driven, sax-assisted electro banger that sounds like a completely different project tacked on the end of the tracklist. (RENDERS was a more synth-focused project, so perhaps it's a holdover from those days.) It's a lovely song, but some listeners will probably assume the album has already ended and something else is has autoplayed.    Ill-fitting finale aside, McMichael and her co-producer Jake Nicoll have created a lush-sounding debut that weaves together several decades' worth of sounds into a seamless pop-rock tapestry. It all feels familiar, yet it's so timeless that it never seems dated.

2021-05-18,Luke Fox,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",A Rejuvenated J. Cole Attacks Rap Like a Contact Sport Again on 'The Off-Season',,"In  the mini documentary  that accompanies  J. Cole 's sixth studio album, the rapper openly ponders a creative crossroads.     Having already proved that he can win on radio with sticky crossover pop, that he can pack basketball arenas as a headlining draw, and that he can also sell platinum without famous guest appearances or hired-gun super-producers supplying the bangers, Cole wondered if he should just hit cruise control. Be a successful label head and talent scout. Sprinkle guest verses. Make beats, but only when inspiration strikes. His legacy and his investment portfolio have afforded the 36-year-old the option to coast into semi-retirement. (Hell, he just  made his pro basketball debut over the weekend .)     J. Cole could've continued wearing his solo act like a badge of honour. He could've decided his best writing had already been recorded. He could've faded away like a wicked jump shot.     Nah. Instead, the scrappy wordsmith from Fayetteville, N.C. chose Door Number 2. He picked up a pen. He put on his editing cap. He enlisted outside help to push him. A zoned-in  Lil Baby  and  21 Savage  on the mic. East Coast icons  Cam'ron  and  Puff Daddy  on the adlibs, to give his project a sprinkle of bluster and grandiosity. And, most important, A-list producers  Boi-1da ,  Timbaland ,  Frank Dukes ,  Jake One , and  ""Middle Child""  beatsmith T-Minus to inspire his couplets.     If 2018's concept-heavy, dangerously didactic  KOD  was Cole drifting into the player-coach stage of his career,  The Off-Season  is Cole lacing up squeaky high-tops and drilling 100,000 hours of threes. Refocused and rejuvenated, Cole is attacking rap like a contact sport again. He wants to break ankles, drop jaws and posterize competitors. (Don't believe for a millisecond that Cole doesn't expect his latest to held side to side with whatever Drake and Kendrick Lamar got cooking for the summer.)     Detractors had begun dismissing J. Cole as a self-righteous leader of some ""fake deep"" movement, that he'd become too above the fray to play ball from his pulpit. Well, from the outset of opener ""9 5 . s o u t h,"" it's very apparent he wants back in the mix. The track — a scorching surprise — is bookended with Killa Cam adlibs and  Lil Jon  crunk callouts. In between, Boi-1da updates the triumph of Jay Z's ""U Don't Know"" and Cole blazes some of his best boast raps, complete with a Nas-ism (""sleep is the cousin of death""). Cole's lust for legacy? We see right through it like Tupac hologram.     Quotable punchlines stack up: ""I be staying out the way, but if the beef do come around / Could put an M right on your head, you Luigi brother now."" And: ""Vivid memories, niggas squeeze, we start duckin' down / So many shells on the ground make the Easter Bunny proud."" He backs up his boasts with 39 minutes of bars that raise it for 2021.      The Off-Season  borders on a mixtape exercise with its brevity, aggressiveness and playful experimentation with a variety of flows. Consider that a compliment when we're talking about an artist who crafted hungry memories on  The Warm Up  in 2009 and  Friday Night Lights  the following year. What this new album lacks in anthems, it makes up for in detail and directness.     Creative curveballs abound. ""m y . l i f e"" refreshes 2002 Styles P single ""The Life,"" with breakout vocalist Morray subbing in for Pharoahe Monch on hook duties. ""Punchin' the Clock"" deftly incorporates a Damian Lillard interview. ""l e t . g o . m y . h a n d"" confirms the rumour that Cole and Diddy scrapped at a VMAs afterparty in 2013 and concludes with a prayer from the latter.     The skips are scarce (maybe ""1 0 0 . m . i. l ',"" which asks its audience to relate to the work ethic of a guy with nine figures on his bank balance); the highlights many. ""p r i d e . i s . t h e . d e v i l"" sees producer T-Minus double-dipping into the same sample he used for Aminé's ""Can't Decide"" last year, but it kickstarts a thoughtful second half of the record as J. Cole wrestles with hubris before passing the mic to an inspired Lil Baby.     ""Close"" is a fevered murder dream that features some of the author's most economic storytelling and one of his most razor-sharp rhyme schemes. Clocking in under three minutes and devoid of a hook, the song is just nice rhymes, vivid imagery, and a stinging soul sample.      The Off-Season  — an earnest return to blood, sweat and ink — doesn't need much more to hit like swish.

That much becomes clear on ""Closer to Mine,"" one of many standout tracks on the Toronto singer-songwriter's entrancing debut album,  Anything Can't Happen . After the song's peculiar intro of dissonant chords and start-stop rhythms, the arrangement suddenly coalesces into a surging groove and, momentarily, it seems like it's going to turn into a kraut-punk scorcher. But then, just 10 seconds later, the whole thing breaks down into drifting ambience and distant, operatic coos.    It's an exciting moment that perfectly captures what makes  Anything Can't Happen  simultaneously familiar yet unpredictable. Paas draws on classic folk and rock influences: the Neil Young-esque groove and Laurel Canyon harmonies at the crescendo of title track ""Anything Can't Happen,"" the pastoral acoustic fingerpicking of ""Perfect Love,"" or the birdsong vocal runs throughout the album.    But even when Paas traverses these familiar folk landscapes, she prefers to take the road less travelled. Her skronky chord voicings and angular rhythms hint at post-hardcore and noise rock, even when they're performed as quiet folk songs. Try to imagine Joni Mitchell fronting Shellac at a coffee shop and you might get some idea of  Anything Can't Happen 's beautiful tension. Bass on the album is handled by one of the songwriter's  many admirers in the Toronto music scene ,  PS I Love You  shredder Paul Saulnier, whose fretless fireworks add to the subtle complexity of the minimal instrumentation.    ""Frozen Window"" is particularly austere, its tense arpeggios crawling along for six minutes. The bare arrangement highlights the poignant beauty of the words, which tumble out in the freeform style of recent Mount Eerie albums: ""Sitting on your couch not speaking / I feel you losing interesting in me / I sense the image you had of me shifting / Revealing all of my flaws / Yes I love myself, but like a mother, in spite of it all / It's hard to see myself in a positive light / It's hard to hear the sound of my voice the way it is in my head."" Paas has said that her music explores themes of non-romantic love, and while her operatic delivery tends to highlight emotion over enunciation,  Anything Can't Happen  is peppered with these moments of startling melancholy.    The album finishes with ""Running Under My Life,"" its dreamscape synths evoking  Twin Peaks  and  Blade Runner  rather than the usual folk influences. It's not what you'd expect from the finale of a folk songwriter's debut album. It just goes to show that, on  Anything Can't Happen , anything can happen.

This time around, Tudor's no less nervy. ""My skin is crawling off of me / I don't know where it wants to go,"" goes a line on  Two Half Words  opener ""Dance Call,"" but the tension has migrated from the jaw to the hips, a coiled rhythm pushing this wallflower to a darkened corner of the dance floor.    While no less interior,  Two Half Words  is more rhythmic than any of Tudor's previous records; the moves may be solo shimmies and quiet hand flicks, but it's a notable shift to something resembling groove from an artist who tends toward the baroque or melancholy. The introductory three song run of ""Dance Call,"" ""Hideaway"" and ""Perennials"" uses drum machines, shakers, snaps, claps and bouncing synth loops to build glassy webs of rhythm, more  Another Green World  than  Veckatimest .    The arrangements on  Two Half Words  lean into the promise of its title, finding beauty in halting breaths, whispered voices and shifting melodies. Thoughts don't finish so much as splinter and multiply; the title track's acoustic shuffle mutates into slippery jazz and tropicália, as Tudor's music finds the transformative power he longs for himself on ""Change My Shape."" There's nothing as burly as  Quotidian Dream 's relative barn-burner ""Quotidian Boy,"" and without its predecessor's immediate sonic peaks and valleys,  Two Half Words ' liquid changes feel a bit amorphous on first listen. However, more time spent reveals the subtle drama in its sparkling burble the hooks on  Two Half Words  are temperature shifts rather than tectonic shifts, melting the icicles instead of shaking the trees.    Tudor's lyrics are largely about communication and its absence; secrets, promises and private moments, the long and quiet things that keep you awake at night. They also, crucially, grapple with the lonesome futility of language itself, the frustration of trying to communicate the incommunicable on ""Dancecall,"" he strains to ""fit a feeling in a line,"" while on ""Perennials,"" he sings, ""Everyone's got a different way to say it / But it's a lonely time to be alive."" Even with eager ears and all the words in the world, sometimes it's still impossible to say precisely what you feel; a shared loneliness is no less lonely.    And while some of the record's most beautiful moments are also its most lush and communal — the collapsing waves of horn that close ""Everybody's Keeping Their Word,"" the gentle vocal harmonies on ""Perennials,"" or the skittering outro on ""Spring"" — its quiet peak is in the empty space of fingerpicked album closer ""You're a Winner Today."" In such naked accompaniment, Tudor strips his lyrics too, opting for a heart-twisting plain speak: ""Haven't slept so well in, like, the last three years."" It's a sort of pep talk, though, even in the fleeting high, Tudor doesn't let his eye stray from the reliable low: ""It's perfect, though it's only minutes long / Go on, feel the feeling / You're a winner today / Doesn't happen much / But it's a good feeling, hey?"" It's a pressingly blue little song, but something shifts as strings and drone begin to roll in slowly at the 2:16 mark. Whether they're players or programmed patches, whether Tudor is surrounded by friends or alone in the studio, is not necessarily clear. What is clear is the strange, sad comfort that comes with those rising tones — all the other brief winners and long-time losers, the half-words and non-words, all those things that can't be articulated turned to sound instead.

2021-05-05,Matthew Ritchie,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Iceage's 'Seek Shelter' Will Restore Anyone's Faith in Rock Music,,"Many bands have been compared to Joy Division over the years, but Copenhagen's  Iceage  have been the closest to ever capturing their essence. When the four-piece post-punk band first emerged with  New Brigade  in 2011, they arrived fully formed — at least in the minds of critics — with a Byronic and laconic frontman, austere stage presence, high cheekbones, (regrettable) flirtations with fascist imagery and unwieldy arrangements that seemed prone to combustion.    But the band never seemed to buy into the hype.    Instead, after upping the ante with 2012's  You're Nothing , Elias Bender Rønnenfelt and co. began a transformation — refining their sound and sanding down their bleak barrage until only rock's roots remained. 2014's  Plowing into the Field of Love  and 2018's  Beyondless  found the band taking inspiration more from Motown, proto-punk, gospel music, and America's honky-tonks than Denmark's DIY clubs to create their maximal rock'n'roll, while side project  Marching Church  allowed Rønnenfelt and guitarist Johan Suurballe Wieth to stretch their artistic muscle by reaching even further into the depths of their record collections.    Now, a decade since their debut, the former  enfant terribles  seem to have arrived at their final destination and sound more assured than ever before with  Seek Shelter   — a stunning achievement that will restore even the most lapsed practitioner's faith in rock music.    Joining them this time around in the studio — alongside additional guitarist Casper Morilla Fernandez and longtime collaborator Nis Bysted — is Pete Kember (a.k.a.  Sonic Boom ). As a shoegaze progenitor and member of Spacemen 3, Kember (an accomplished solo artist and producer in his own right) has been known to perfectly merge the sweet and the sour. Here, he takes Rønnenfelt's half-drunk-sounding hymns and elevates them to levels of agony and ecstasy previously unattainable by the band alone.    Album opener ""Shelter Song"" offers up a Noel Gallagher-esque riff to the masses before being joined by a choir and delivering a chorus that soars with a Mick Jagger swagger. And on ""High & Hurt"" and single ""Vendetta,"" their trademark rollicking guitars and roiling drums nearly boil over as the band confidently chugs along to a steady groove.    Elsewhere, they soften their standoffish sound with ""Love Kills Slowly"" and ""Drink Rain"" — the former containing some of Rønnenfelt's clearest and connecting lyrics, while the latter is their strangest and silliest song to date, as the frontman sings about drinking up stormwater to feel closer to a love interest. The band then movie past the heart and go straight for the id with Springsteen-esque standout ""Gold City"" and sacred pub thumper ""Saint Cecilia.""    Providing some parting closure on ""The Holding Hand,"" Rønnenfelt sings of a ""limp-wristed God"" and one's never-ending search for solace and a saviour.  Seek Shelter , as a whole, finds Iceage refusing to be pigeonholed and instead reaching out — exploring life, love and the lack thereof — and ending up exactly where they should be.

2021-05-05,Stephan Boissonneault,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Paul Jacobs Stirs Up a Psychedelic Melting Pot with 'Pink Dogs on the Green Grass',,"Paul Jacobs , Montreal's  garage-psych one-man-band  (and drummer of arty post-punks  Pottery ), delivers just the right amount of dopamine on  Pink Dogs on the Green Grass , kickstarting what will hopefully be an optimistic summer. In terms of production, it's one of the prolific singer-songwriter's clearest-sounding batches of recordings, adding acoustic drums and open-chord folk to his trippy rock sound.    Capping off at 13 songs,  Pink Dogs on the Green Grass  is a mix of everything — at points sounding like early Deerhunter meets the off-kilter bongos of Paul Simon's  Graceland  with the opening track ""Christopher Robbins."" The balladry of ""Day to Day,"" meanwhile, is eerily reminiscent of a freak-folk Devendra Banhart track, with its washed synths, bopping guitar line, and Jacobs' halcyon vocals.    The juxtaposition between vintage and modern sonics is present everywhere on this album. The vocal layering in ""Half Rich Loner"" recalls the  Pet Sounds  era, but the buzzing garage freakout grounds it enough to feel new. The continuous hazy cadence of ""Cherry"" reverberates through the mind, evoking a state of stillness, almost a meditative trance. That trance continues with ""Everything's Fine,"" with its fuzzy keyboards and psychedelic dance funk hook.    Even though it seems like certain sounds appear at random, Jacobs is meticulous in how they loop, drone out, or organically decay, to achieve his sonic mind-bending sound. Just listen to ""Underneath the Roses,"" which sounds like if Beck kept up his weird anti-folk. Even ""Dancing with the Devil,"" the album's most bare-bones track, enthralls with its noticeable Lou Reed influence.    Jacobs is a musician with an abundance of talent and a melting pot of influences who knows what he's going for on every track — or at least he's good at making it seem like he does. On  Pink Dogs on the Green Grass , Jacobs has put himself up there with other psych-rock solo wonders like White Fence, Ty Segall and Morgan Delt.

2021-05-06,Ian Gormely,6,"SKA,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Mighty Mighty Bosstones Stay True to Themselves on 'When God Was Great',,"Ska, if you haven't heard, is having a moment.    After two decades as the butt of many, many jokes, the genre unexpectedly found itself on a cultural ascendency in 2020. Much of the newfound interest in skanking can be chalked up to a new generation of artists reinvigorating the genre (Kill Lincoln, the Interrupters, We Are the Union, JER and their cover work as Skatune Network), not to mention the bizarre confluence of a population eager for music that can both denounce racism and start a much-needed party.    As if on cue, in January,  the Mighty Mighty Bosstones  dropped  ""The Final Parade,""  a ska posse cut featuring a who's who of the genre's past, present and future: Amy Interrupter, Tim Timebomb, and members of the Specials, Fishbone, Less than Jake, the Aquabats! and even Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, to name but a few, all appear on the eight-minute track that closes the Bosstones' 11th studio album.     Though their spotlight has dimmed since the great heights of the '90s ska explosion, the song, essentially a call to arms for lifers, proves the band retain a strong role as convenors in the ska continuum. Ironically, it's also the greatest show of ambition on a record that otherwise stays true to its pledge.  When God Was Great  is exactly what one would expect any Mighty Mighty Bosstones record to sound like: driving, determined, occasionally clumsy, but just as often insightful and introspective — though never to the point where it would get in the way of a good time. Honestly, this thing could have come out 10, 20, or even 25 years ago (to be clear: this is a compliment).     If there's a throughline to the record, it's the resolve to stay true to yourself and the people you love. That's been a tried-and-true theme for the past couple of decades, as the Bosstones have moved from kings of the scene to the elder statesmen of third wave ska. In that same period, the band's musical influences have deepened. ""Certain Things"" boasts lap steel guitar, while ""The Killing of Georgie (Part III),"" about George Floyd, references a Rod Stewart song. They even throw in a Creedence Clearwater Revival cover. Despite the band's deep roots in Boston's '80s hardcore scene, it turns out these guys like some classic rock as much as the rest of us.    At just under an hour, the record nevertheless feels a tad long — a dull stretch towards the back third in particular drags down the album's momentum. The voice of lead singer Dicky Barrett, now in his mid-fifties, lacks the sheer power of the band's '90s heyday. But he's found new, more soulful contours. And while the record lacks the harder edge of their earliest LPs, the band still largely sound excited to be playing together over three decades in. To put that in classic rock terms, at similar points in their careers, the Rolling Stones were sampling Biz Markie and David Bowie was making jungle tracks.     The number of ska bands still going strong from that late-'90s boom period is impressive, if not surprising. Though the scene's presence on the soundtrack of teen comedies was fleeting, it's been a constant, if under-the-radar, subsection of punk for decades. Every once in a while, the music cognoscenti decides to take an interest only to find the Mighty Mighty Bosstones still skanking along.

2021-05-06,Leslie Ken Chu,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Century Egg Dance Down an Existential Spiral on 'Little Piece of Hair' EP,,"Century Egg 's  Little Piece of Hair  is a joyful rebellion for those trapped in their minds. With most people confined to their homes, too, the six-song EP provides sweet release for all their pent-up energy. The Halifax quartet project their exuberant, rough-around-the-edges racket in an attempt to bring down the mental and physical walls around them.    Like Century Egg's 2020 EP,  We Can Play , their latest offering contains no shortage of earworms. Shane Keyu Song's voice still bobs atop Robert Drisdelle's thick-cut — and cutting — guitar lines like a buoy behind a speeding boat. But on  Little Piece of Hair , the band's new rhythm section, drummer Meg Yoshida (Not You) and bassist Matty Grace (Cluttered, Future Girls), steers Century Egg in a heavier direction.     Little Piece of Hair  races around the themes of discovering oneself as a path to freedom and of self-actualization under trying circumstances. The EP teeters on a line between joy and despair as thin as, well, a strand of hair. ""Ring a Bell"" is a crunchy blast of pop-punk in the vein of Tacocat. Throughout the track, Song basically repeats three lines: ""Ring a bell,"" ""Let's go to the studio,"" and ""I'm happy today."" Just do what brings you joy, her words suggest. But given the weight of the rest of the EP, it's hard not to hear denial every time she sings, ""I'm happy today.""    Song feels the push and pull between confidence and her destructive imagination on the battle cry ""I Will Make Up a Method."" The track marches with hearty determination. ""I got time / I got dedication / I am full of patience / I know what to practice,"" she sings before pledging to conquer the enemies within herself. By the end, she runs out of time and patience, declaring, ""Now it's time for action.""    ""Do You Want to Dance?"" is a full-on sprint into the deep abyss. Song questions the purpose of life, asking ""Does it all have meaning? / Why do we do the things the way we do?"" and ""Do you think we are doing it right?"" Meanwhile, she's ""dressed to the nines,"" wasting her nights away downtown. Century Egg are heading down a spiral staircase of existentialism, but they're dancing every step of the way to the very bottom.    The narrator on ""Do You Want to Dance"" beams, ""We're going on an odyssey."" In the same spirit, the title track's lyrics follow a curious, adventure-seeking little piece of hair. Like Song's joyful, rebellious soul, ""A little piece of hair will never die,"" she sings on this full-throttle gut-punch. It's a callback to go-for-glory anthems of classic rock'n'roll.    The EP burns fast upfront, but the musical tone changes in its last two tracks. ""Riddle to Place"" drags its feet into ""Cornered,"" the EP's only track sung in Mandarin. Like the best post-punk, ""Cornered"" is sharp-edged and danceable because of, not despite, its brooding urgency. Here, Song fears the unknown and feels she's running out of steam to make it to tomorrow, but she tries her best not to worry. Though lyrics don't translate precisely between Mandarin and English, her key sentiment remains: ""What's the use thinking about it? / It's yesterday, it's tomorrow.""    According to Century Egg,  Little Piece of Hair  celebrates the changes life delivers. That's where the EP might fall short — listeners' lives didn't just  change  over the last year, they got uprooted and flipped upside down and inside out. But even for them, at the very least,  Little Piece of Hair  could help find the small graces. After all, it only takes a pinhole of light to see the end of the tunnel.

2021-05-06,Adam Feibel,6,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Pillea's 'Swell' Is a Familiar Mishmash of College Rock and Midwest Emo,,"Micah Brown evokes the days of college rock and Midwest emo throughout  Swell , the Montreal-based singer-songwriter's debut album as Pillea. Following his work leading the St. John's-based melodic garage-punk band  MAANS , Brown moves toward a more textured, emotive approach with this solo project. You can immediately hear the influence of alt-rockers like Jimmy Eat World, American Football and the Weakerthans on  Swell , so it's comforting and familiar if you're one of the many who have fostered an intimate relationship with these types of groups over the last 20 years.     Throughout  Swell , Brown looks to catalogue and cache the disappointments in his life, whether they're circumstantial or self-inflicted. The speedy power-pop of ""Great Success"" speaks to the idea of tempering one's expectations, reframing one's ambitions and reprioritizing one's efforts: ""I'm giving up on great success / I want to give you what I can / I just want to feel that I tried to be honest."" On the slower ""Swell,"" this theme continues: ""Who am I to be dissatisfied? / Would I rather fail than die?""     Brown tries out a few different sounds throughout the album, bringing to mind other emo or emo-adjacent acts like Transit, Death Cab for Cutie, Mineral and Motion City Soundtrack. ""Away"" pulls from moody '90s alt-rock like Jimmy Eat World's  Clarity  and Gin Blossoms'  New Miserable Experience , while lyrically, it employs the youthful romanticism of the Menzingers. With its sweet melodies and knotty chords, ""Steal Your Time"" sounds like if Peaer took musical cues from blink-182. ""WIIP"" leans toward electronic dream-pop with echoing vocals, a thumping drum machine and a synth effect that gives it an innocent, toybox sound befitting a song about self-assurance: ""Wins are coming but just not today / When I'm in panic I just have to breathe.""     Self-produced with help from Foxing's Eric Hudson and mixed by Billy Mannino (who worked on Oso Oso's breakout  The Yunahon Mixtape ), Swell is a great-sounding record with a good balance of professional polish and DIY charm. The acoustic-led ""Sunday"" is a well-layered song that attempts to wryly satirize and reappropriate Christian tradition; lyrically, it only finds its way partly there, but musically it does make for fine comfort food.    The rich, ringing guitars, plucky harmonics and moody pace of ""The Weight"" speak to the ubiquity of Mike Kinsella's influence in the world of autumnal, introverted indie-rock. Together, ""Suffering"" and ""Swell"" sound a bit like R.E.M. or the Smiths played with a mix of major-seventh emo and Americana twang. Yet while these three songs have dynamic, engaging vocal melodies, they're delivered over an instrumental backdrop that feels too static.    For all of Brown's strengths as a performer and producer, Swell may struggle to stand out only because it sounds too familiar. Pillea doesn't have much of an identity of its own, ending up rather as a mishmash of regurgitated sounds of college rock and Midwest emo.  Swell  is skillfully crafted on a solid foundation. But if Pillea is going to really demand attention, Brown may want to create something that's still familiar yet unmistakably new.

2021-05-10,Kaelen Bell,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",St. Vincent Makes the Most of Her Dive into '70s Shimmer on 'Daddy's Home',,"Annie Clark has become a modern guitar hero precisely for the fact that half the time, you'd hardly know she was playing guitar. From the blast of purple distortion that detonates in the middle of ""Northern Lights"" to the pixelated serpent that twists and slithers across the back half of ""Rattlesnake,"" her guitar playing is unfamiliar and difficult, a subversion of the self-indulgent axe-mastery of yore. In its physical shape on stage — gripped tightly and pulled close to the body — the guitar is familiar, a bone thrown to the cantankerous rockists that suggests maybe guitar music isn't really dead and gone. But in its incorporeal presence, squealing and glitching and precise, it becomes unfamiliar again — the sound from the uncanny valley, ricocheting up the mountainside.    That dichotomy has come to embody the character of  St. Vincent  on a larger scale too, a shapeshifting rock star who lives in the echo between familiarity and strangeness, sincerity and coldness, expression and calculation. So what happens when the tension is released and the guitar simply becomes a guitar? When the character is no longer severe but severely chill, when the stricture becomes softness? You get  Daddy's Home , a great record and a bit of a lesson in the pitfalls of control.    Clark seems to approach each promotional cycle with a loose script of sorts, a protective barrier that ensures there will always be an answer, regardless of the question. For 2014's  self-titled album , the language was near-future cult leaders and paramount grooves. For 2017's  MASSEDUCTION , it was subjugation and power and slide guitar. It's a pretty understandable antidote to the emotional fatigue of back-to-back-to-back interviews, and a way to keep the conversation manageable and on one's own terms. The trouble comes when the script fails to account for the questions being raised, when the narrative becomes too unwieldy even for its creator.     Daddy's Home  is a record about many things — the Sheena Easton-interpolating ""My Baby Wants a Baby"" breathes new life into a sweet, anticipatory love song by swapping the perspective and twisting all the yearning into a frightened spiral on selfishness, commitment and the weight of legacy. The fingerpicked swirl of ""Somebody Like Me"" is a treatise on the terrifying rush of love, the risk inherent in giving yourself over to someone and the responsibility in being given over to. ""Down"" is pure rage, snarling with a funkified version of the incandescent cruelty that powered 2012's  ""Krokodil""  single. It's a rich and complex collection of songs, though you'd hardly know it given the online chatter that surrounds it.    As has been reported ad infinitum since the album's announcement, Clark's father was sentenced to 12 years in 2010 for his role in a $43 million stock-manipulation scheme. Clark has covered this before — recorded in the immediate aftermath of her father's imprisonment, 2011's  Strange Mercy  was a pained, constricted record that dealt with themes of bondage, isolation and America in the abstract.  Daddy's Home  was made on the other side, a more humorous and literal affair that attempts to reclaim Clark's story after it was unearthed by tabloids in the wake of her burgeoning celebrity. It's a frequently beautiful record, stretching and dirtying some of the baroque softness that coloured  Marry Me  and  Actor .     But in choosing such an aesthetics-driven version of her father's story as the leading promotional frame, Clark may have done her own work a disservice. Issues of abolition, state violence, mass incarceration, privilege and transparency — it's possible that Clark didn't expect the record to garner such (understandable and unavoidable) real-world baggage. But to suggest that Clark not write about her father's story is, of course, absurd, and to suggest she write it in more palatable or universal terms is equally so. What do we want from our artists if not an unshakeable belief in their own vision? And do we really need a promo cycle that has Clark, of all people, speaking at length on mass incarceration in America? It's hard to know what we want, or how Clark expected this story to be received. But it's a testament to the inherent risk in such strict narrative management, as the realities and complications of many will inevitably impose on the story of one.    The good and simple news is that  Daddy's Home  shines through  the muck that's accumulated around it . Whatever your opinion of the album's campy visual construct or storytelling perspective, there's little denying that sonically, Clark makes the most of her dive into sweaty '70s shimmer. Songs like ""Somebody Like Me"" and ""Down and Out Downtown"" soar with a lightness that her music hasn't really touched since  Actor 's ""Just the Same but Brand New,"" while ""…At the Holiday Party"" is one of the most straightforward and beautiful things she's ever written. Six-and-a-half minute epic ""Live in the Dream"" features the first ever honest-to-god St. Vincent shred-fest, a careening and cocky solo that, this far into her tenure as modern guitar master, feels genuinely earned. And though he's only mentioned once in passing, on ""Down and Out Downtown,"" the entire record feels like a cumulative ode to the mercurial Johnny of ""Prince Johnny"" and ""Happy Birthday, Johnny,"" an album dedicated to troubled friends and wandering spirits.    The halting funk of the title track is a somewhat uncomfortable fit, though Clark's sideways guitar work rescues it. And while it's a thrill musically, the blunt lyrics in ""Down"" feel at odds with the rest of the record's self-aware mythmaking. Jack Antonoff's production fingers are less obvious here than they were on the bombastic  MASSEDUCTION , as both artists flex some new muscles by way of coppery Wurlitzer, sitar-mimicking guitar and melodies that tend toward resolution over whiplash.    Still, it's hard to ignore that, besides ""…At the Holiday Party,"" the Antonoff co-writes are some of the record's least successful moments. Whether it's always relatable or not, Clark does her best work at arm's length, her outward emotional remove part of her imperious appeal. Antonoff's bald-faced sincerity throws things off their axis — St. Vincent records have always been immensely personal and emotional, but the strange magic is in the way she forces you to bring yourself to the music rather than give herself away.    But while  Daddy's Home  may not be her best record, it's a bold and rewarding one. And if what we expect from our artists is art — uncompromising, singular, sometimes clumsy and rife with feelings or stories both understandable and not —  then few comprehend the exchange quite like St. Vincent.  (Concord)                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More St. Vincent",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/st_vincent_daddys_home_album_review
2021-05-10,Paul Dika,9,"POP AND ROCK,MODERN COMPOSITION,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Fucked Up's Narrative Ambitions Are Finally Fully Realized on 'Year of the Horse',,"During their 20-plus years as a band,  Fucked Up  have never shied away from taking chances and stepping outside of whatever box critics and fans have tried to put them in. Their evolution over the years has seen them morph from a hardcore punk band to an act that has become almost impossible to label with a genre.    The one constant has been an appetite for taking on projects that continue to grow larger and more ambitious in scale. The band already have two rock operas under their belt with 2011's  David Comes to Life  and 2018's  Dose Your Dreams , plus  a score for the 1928 silent film  Zanzibar  and a collection of 20-minute long singles as part of the Zodiac series, starting with 2006's  Year of the Dog . While these previous works were successes in their own right, Fucked Up have built off the strengths of these past releases, and put forth their most narratively, thematically and sonically cohesive effort yet with  Year of the Horse .     Year of the Horse  serves as the ninth instalment in the Zodiac series and, despite its appearances as a single song, clocks in at over 90 minutes. Broken up into four acts and individual scenes therein,  The Year of the Horse Whose Name Was Perceval  follows the titular Perceval who, trapped on Earth, is in search of a way back to her rightful home amongst the celestial. When Perceval escapes the small western town of Abfall, which has been consumed by thievery, violence and evil, she is chased into the surrounding Wastelands by a cast of characters. Merciless sheriff Bloody Lance and his posse of deputies, lead the pursuit, while Blanche, a young girl, is brought along by her cruel mother Drunken Kaye, a deputy of Lance's and former wife to Sheriff King, who has since been banished from the town. As Perceval and the posse embark on their odyssey, they have to contend with the perils of the Wastelands themselves, and the spells that Sour (an old wizard from Abfall, responsible for the evils running rampant in the town) casts in an effort to impede Perceval's escape.    Fairly straightforward, right? And that's just scratching the surface.    The story, crafted by Fucked Up's Mike Haliechuk (who also wrote the lyrics), in collaboration with playwright David James Brock, carries an aesthetic that blends together Western and fantasy archetypes to create a text that feels like a crossover between  Red Dead Redemption  and  Dungeons & Dragons . And while the narrative aesthetics of  David Comes to Life  and  Dose Your Dreams  had some inconsistencies marrying the accompanying songs, the same cannot be said for  Year of the Horse . In one scene, a slow cadence of whistling and finger snaps accompanies the posse as they wander the wastelands, feeling not unlike an Ennio Morricone score from the  Dollars Trilogy . As well, in a recurring theme, crunching palm-muted guitars ascend, accompanied by lead singer Damian Abraham's growl, as tensions build toward trouble for Perceval and young Blanche.    There are soaring trumpets when the posse is in full pursuit of Perceval, weeping violins and cellos during moments of tragedy, and heavy synths used to convey the mystical and celestial elements of the story. Some scenes feel like they've been plucked from a Sufjan Stevens record, a Oneohtrix Point Never score, or would even fit in with Fucked Up's earlier work, but the stylistic choice is always made in the interest of serving the narrative. Haliechuk and the band have composed each scene so meticulously that the result is a visceral experience where the complexity of the story and the characters are elevated by the accompanying score.    In addition to the variety in genre, the volume and talent of guest vocalists pace  Horse  further in front of previous albums. The layout of the lyrics and story surely help, but the contributions from other artists breathe further life into the characters and events that unfold. Tuka Mohammed, Maegan Brooks Mills and Eidolon lend their talents and breathe life into Blanche, Kaye and King throughout the piece, alongside contributions from  Matt Berninger  of the National and  Julien Baker  (who is featured in arguably the album's most beautiful moments). Even Haliechuk and longtime Fucked Up percussionist/trumpeter Jonah Falco lend their vocal talents to some scenes. All the vocalists deliver their performances with the appropriate emotion required for each scene, and effectively capture the mood of each character, as well as the tone of the story.    All of these pieces work together to convey the themes of perseverance, forgiveness, and redemption  Horse  explores. Despite the evils at play, Perceval keeps moving forward, driven by the songs of her celestial mother. Scenes featuring frantic drums and guitars are often contrasted by scenes featuring celestial synths, angelic horns, and ascending octave chord progressions.

2021-05-10,Matt Bobkin,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",TEKE::TEKE Showcase Many Possibilities of Their Kaleidoscopic Psych Rock on 'Shirushi',,"No one else is doing it quite like  TEKE::TEKE . The Montreal-based psych septet became known internationally on the backs of their fearsome live show, where they delivered their throwback J-rock with theatrical flair. Born out of what was intended to be a one-off tribute performance honouring the work of influential Japanese guitarist Takeshi ""Terry"" Terauchi, TEKE::TEKE quickly grew into a full-fledged band that built on the  eleki  movement that Terry helped to establish.    Eleki, the '60s-era surf rock movement born following the Ventures' first tour of Japan, is just one of many influences heard on  Shirushi , TEKE::TEKE's debut full-length. Prog, noise, post-rock and chamber pop all have their time to shine throughout the album's nine tracks. Driven by the nimble leaps of Yuki Isami's flute, the rattling brass of Etienne Lebel's trombone and Maya Kuroki's dramatic vocalizations, TEKE::TEKE meld a truly unique blend of disparate elements into an immersive cinematic world, rooted in rock music but seeking to traverse much more over the album's runtime.     Shirushi 's strongest moments are when TEKE::TEKE use their psych-jam roots as the foundation for something greater, whether the hypnotic build of opener ""Kala Kala"" that serves as an introduction to each of the band's elements, the jaunty strut of ""Barbara"" or the rousing surf climax of ""Meikyu.""    Moments when they stray from this concept are less impactful for a variety of reasons. Lengthy instrumental passages effectively set the scene with a range of emotions, from string-plucked mystique on ""Dobugawa"" to whimsical curiosity on ""Sarabande,"" but often blend together into the scenery, with overlapping instrumentation vying for focus and no clear leader to take charge, shouldering both the pros and cons of a film soundtrack. Other moments, such as straight-up surf rocker ""Yoru Ni,"" mine too familiar territory.    The project's full potential is realized on closer ""Tekagami,"" where TEKE::TEKE's psych rock roots are all but obliterated in favour of  Paris 1919 -style chamber pop. Kuroki's voice is hushed and intimate, the percussion is subtle yet noticeable, and the lush instrumentation augments both tension and release.    Alongside the band's jammy calling cards, the strengths TEKE::TEKE display on  Shirushi  speak to a strong sense of worldbuilding off the strength of central melodies and the versatility of their unique instrumental setup. Eleki and psych rock appear to not be enough for the seven-piece's voracious and diverse musical appetites, and  Shirushi  offers many directions from which the band could reasonably choose.

2021-05-11,Luke Fox,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Czarface Collab 'Super What?' Does MF DOOM's Legacy Justice,,"When a person dies, loved ones are often told to remember how they lived. Think of the times they were vibrant and carefree and in his element. The best version of themself.     So, as stunned as the rap world was on New Year's Eve upon learning that  MF DOOM   had died  before he'd reached 50, his first posthumous release is a capsule of better days. A fun and fantastical reminder of the rapper born Daniel Dumile's wild imagination and unpredictable rhyme patterns that made us all root for the Villain to begin with.     Recorded in early 2020 and intended to drop in April of that year,  Czarface  and DOOM's second collaborative album,  Super What? , was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic so its creators could focus on family and fine-tune its mix.     ""We were incredibly fortunate to have collaborated with DOOM,"" lead vocalist Esoteric wrote in  the announcement of the delayed project . ""He was a one-of-a-kind, never-to-be-duplicated emcee, producer, and visionary. We wish peace and healing to his family, friends and everyone touched by the gifts he shared with the planet.""     Following the spirit of 2018's  Czarface Meets Metal Face  — the first extended link-up between DOOM and the three-headed monster that is Czarface (producer/DJ  7L ,  Esoteric  and Wu-Tang wordsmith  Inspectah Deck ) —  Super What?  bangs with sci-fi boom-bap, quirky sample chops and razor-sharp wordplay.     From the cover art (off the pen of longtime Czarface collaborator LAmour Supreme) to the meticulous stitching of vocal bites and a unique guest list dripping with personality ( Del the Funky Homosapien ,  DMC , Kendra Morris, Godforbid), there is care taken to deliver the type of mythical world-making that does DOOM's legacy justice. (Orders of the physical LP will get you a comic book written by Esoteric and illustrated by Benjamin Marra.)     It's no stretch to believe that without DOOM's seminal 1999 album  Operation: Doomsday , Czarface's entire superhero saga would lack an origin story. Dumile wore masks way before it was cool.     There isn't a trace of sentimentality to be found on  Super What?  The record — a tight, loopy, 10-track ride that clocks in at the length of a 1968  Spider-Man  episode — is silly and funky and chock-full of quotables. These are grown rappers playing make-believe; their abandon is gleefully reckless. Putting himself in position of a Czarface victim, Deck wonders: ""How they kill a body and still party like it wasn't them?"" Esoteric boasts that he ""jacked Iron Man for his suit and left him Stark naked."" And DOOM vows to ""make you eat a dick with chips and a Heineken."" Yep, it's that kind of combo.    As ever, DOOM's writing is far and away the most esoteric of all (ironically). Like this jewel, from ""Jason & the Czargonauts"": ""Snatched the bag like the Grinch, dag, it's a cinch / Snagged with the burner and ain't seen your man since / Irrelevant to tag if the swag is past tense / And karma swing backwards and drag, you can't flinch / A thrill you deserve to feel if your ass is that dense.""     7L flips a killer Method Man sample on ""Break in the Action."" And LP closer ""Young World"" is a skippy, silly update on Slick Rick's '88 classic ""Hey Young World,"" with Deck and Eso flipping Rick's rhyme patterns. Even the song titles (""Mando Calrissian,"" ""DOOM Unto Others"") hit like ka-blam!      Say What?  is hardly DOOM's definitive work, but it gives us one last snapshot of a solitary mind that spurted in wonderfully volatile ways. In his own words, as hurled on the ghoulish ""So Strange,"" this is DOOM ""remaining weird, dancing 'round with evil.""     We dare not remember him in any other state.  ( Gasdrawls )                           HIP-HOP   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More MF DOOM         More Czarface",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/czarface_mf_doom_super_what_album_review

KUČKA  might know a thing or two about that. For the past few years, the UK-born, Australia-based producer also known as Laura Jane Lowther has collaborated with some of the biggest names out there from Vince Staples to Flume, all the while tinkering with songs that now form  Wrestling , a proper debut album that might soon cement her pop star status.    What could have been a vanity project — one more overstuffed pop album engineered to maximize streams — is in fact a thrilling ensemble of electronic songs that borrow the sheen of R&B and pop music while cultivating its weirdness. Evoking '90s-era Björk, KUČKA uses this album to test the form and the structures of what a song can be, from the refined clarity of the confidential ballad ""Patience"" to the bubbly excitement of the oblique banger ""Sky Brown.""    Detuned synth tones and layered textures blend in with Lowther's crystalline voice, often letting the lyrics melt into the mix, as if to veil their introspective nature. KUČKA has again and again proven her talent for complex hooks and catchy melodies, which are at the forefront here on ""Drowning"" and ""Afterparty"".    For better or worse,  Wrestling  isn't the birth of a star, but rather the revelation of a pop auteur who deserves her place amongst the long list of her illustrious collaborators.

2021-04-29,Dylan Barnabe,7,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Leon Vynehall Finds Himself to Be the Ultimate Muse on 'Rare, Forever'",,"Leon Vynehall , a consistent one-to-watch among UK producers, has long been able to channel memory into music. His debut album  Nothing Is Still  chartered the story of his grandparents as they emigrated to New York in the 1960s, while  Music for the Uninvited  drew inspiration from the mixtapes his mother would play on the way to school. But upon hitting his milestone 30th birthday, Vynehall found himself to be the ultimate muse.     Rare, Forever  is a skin-shedding. Like the ouroboros pictured on its cover, the album is an act of reinvention and rebirth. Vynehall enters a new era of music; more abstract, less linear; more forward-looking, less rearview mirror. In trying to uncover himself more completely as an artist, Vynehall lets go of the cohesive core and linear progression that has largely underpinned the majority of his discography, though this isn't entirely a bad thing.  Rare, Forever  feels less like an album and more like a series of single, punctuated thoughts; or one man's long meditation. It's a little jumpy, and pulses with frenetic energy. He oscillates between dancefloor bangers (""Dumbo"") and languid transitions (""Allchea Vella Amor"").     Ever the intellect, he begins the album with ""Ecce! Ego!"" (""Behold! Me!"" in Latin); a bold opener that lays plain its protagonist. Leaning into his perchance for classical elements, he quickly changes pace to a moody deluge of synth and bass. The album is haunted by the presence of a mysterious character named Velvet, whose being is left purposefully ambiguous and shrouded in mystery. Velvet appears on a few tracks, such as ""In>Pin"" and ""All I See Is You, Velvet Brown"", while Vynehall is careful not to provide too many details. Velvet provides an added philosophical layer to  Rare, Forever , as well as a welcome foil to Vynehall's own persona.    The UK producer is a master of texture, and his sophomore album does not disappoint. He pings from house to jazz to ambient to drone to techno, all the while delighting in the kind of world-building only Vynehall can bring to the table — though it might be considered more of a demolition project in this case.  Rare, Forever  allows Vynehall the space to experiment and explore music beyond his DJ roots. His plunge into the more abstract and conceptual is a bold choice, and one that pays off. ""An Exhale"" is sheer sonic optimism bound to make a believer out of anyone, while ""Mothra"" details the euphoria of finding purpose. The result, across the board, is an extremely creative venture that exclaims loudly: ""Behold! Me!""    It feels trite to take any album's title as literal translation, but how else to describe Vynehall's enduring presence within the industry — he is a rarity, and his music certainly has the possibility to last forever.

2021-04-30,Papa Minnow,8,"ALBUM,HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Toronto's Lil Berete Sets His Sights on the World with 'Icebreaker 2',,"There's always pressure when a young artist releases their first musical project, but there's even more pressure for the follow-up. Sometimes, that may result in experimentation and a radical departure from the debut. But in the case of  Icebreaker 2 , the follow up to  Lil Berete 's  2018 debut mixtape , the rapper's experimentation is broadening but still familiar.    With the release of a follow-up project comes the expectation for growth. While the first  Icebreaker  featured fellow Toronto rappers JoEazy and Acerrr, Berete extends his reach to an international audience by enlisting features from UK rapper Nafe Smallz, Louisville's 2KBaby, and Detroit's Sada Baby. The pandemic has held many artists back from releasing their projects, but Berete has shown he's willing to put himself out there to the world, no holds barred.    That willingness to bear it all is very apparent from the moment you press play on intro track ""Lost It,"" a song in which Berete melodically raps about his pain of losing loved ones to the streets and his internal struggles to be able to love again in fear of further loss. It's an emotionally charged track that serves as a powerful intro into Berete's upbringing and what he's had to endure at such a young age to get to where he is today.    Much of the mixtape's subject matter is centred on what you would come to expect from street rap: getting to the money to escape the hood, the harsh reality of losing friends at a young age, and the means by which kids chose to cope with their reality. It's here that Berete falters slightly on  Icebreaker 2 , as multiple tracks touch on the same subject matter. While this is to be expected of a young artist on only his second major project, it does still manage to create a bit of listener fatigue.    However, the 20-year-old Toronto rapper is able to mitigate much of the fatigue with his sheer talent and versatility. Berete's biggest strength is in his ability to use his cadence and flow in several different ways. In a sea of artists that tend to sound similar, Berete's vocals are a refreshing tide. The sonic range from ""War Ready"" to ""Painallgo'' to ""Big Man"" is a testament to how good he is today, and what magnitude of potential is possible for him in the future.    Berete's level of versatility also shines on each of the songs featuring other artists. ""Murda"" sees him crooning about learning from mistakes in order to make it in music alongside 2KBaby; on ""No Distractions"" he flows effortlessly over the jingling beat before dishing it off to Nafe Smallz; ""Big Man"" sees Berete adapt to a synth bounce beat that's more catered to Sada Baby's sound. It's a step in the right direction that shows what he's capable of when working with new artists on new sounds.     Icebreaker 2  shows Lil Berete's growth as he attempts to broaden his career internationally. This concise and well-crafted mixtape ought to get him the attention he's looking for.

2021-04-30,Cole Brocksom,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Charmaine Shows Who's in Charge on 'HOOD AVANT-GARDE' EP,,"Last fall, Toronto-based rapper  Charmaine  showed us how  ""BOLD""  she could be with the release of her debut single, and she lives up to and even raises that high bar she set for herself with the follow-up EP,  HOOD AVANT-GARDE .    At 5 tracks and only 12 minutes,  HOOD AVANT-GARDE  is practically bursting at the seams with personality and beats as bombastic as Charmaine's attitude.  Singles ""BOLD"" and ""WOO!"" serve as a centrepiece for the project, surrounded by three new songs that go just as hard as the tracks we've already heard . That attitude is put front and centre on the opener ""I DON'T CARE"": with a bouncing baseline and smacking vocal delivery, the track starts at 10 and cranks it up from there when the beat hits.    Those beats are nothing to sniff at either.  HOOD AVANT-GARDE  goes beyond the formula of just slapping 808s and rapid-fire hi-hats: the instrumentals are meticulously crafted, gathering sounds from trap and drill as easily as house and African drum rhythms. The whole project is incredibly rhythmic, running the gamut of percussion and pushing the music forward.    The track ""DOUBLE DUTCH"" is a standout both in instrumental and in bars, with an irresistible two-note horn melody and drums bashing beneath some of the tightest flows and best lyrics Charmaine brings on the EP. ""If you want beef they gon' serve you a plate / Girl what? Man you know you plant-based,"" she raps — just one example of Charmaine putting listeners in their place.    The lyricism isn't always that memorable, though, and Charmaine's flows aren't exactly something we haven't heard before. But she isn't trying to flaunt her technique, and the verses are never found wanting. Charmaine holds her own and carries the EP through her audacious performances and high-energy delivery. A debut project with songs that can go toe-to-toe with contemporaries like  City Girls  and  Megan Thee Stallion  is something to be proud of.    The terms 'punchy' and 'in-your-face' are clichés, but for good reason: they describe what's so infectious about music like  HOOD AVANT-GARDE . Charmaine takes up the space she wants on each of these tracks and makes sure you know who's in charge — all while making you want to dance, too. Charmaine's  HOOD AVANT-GARDE  is a must-listen for fans of Toronto hip-hop.

2021-04-30,Adam Feibel,7,"PUNK,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK",Origami Angel's Easycore-Inspired 'GAMI GANG' Is Pure Joy,,"Now that the cult fandom of  Origami Angel 's breakout debut,  Somewhere City , has positioned them as a leading emissary in the fifth wave of emo, the Washington, D.C.-based band has more than enough good will to go big on their second record. So that's what they've done.    With a title that affectionately nods to their fans,  GAMI GANG  is a bold move. It's a 20-track double album that mostly abides by the Barney Stinson philosophy on mixtapes: ""get psyched."" Almost all of the record's 50 minutes are dedicated to super-charged pop-punk ragers. While  Somewhere City  mixed youthful fun with wistful yearning,  GAMI GANG  is a pure joy factory. Just about every song is a high-grade shot of dopamine.    Next to the likes of Dogleg and Oso Oso, Origami Angel seem like the lovable goofballs of modern emo. The duo of vocalist/guitarist Ryland Heagy and drummer Pat Doherty have a rare ability to make music that sounds both tongue-in-cheek and intensely earnest. Their songs are sweet, frenzied little anthems for the introverts and sensitive-types.    Combining six years' worth of material,  GAMI GANG  is an explosion of ideas. Origami Angel combine skate-punk, power-pop and metalcore into something that resembles the ""easycore"" trend of the late 2000s — a subgenre of pop-punk that's even more embarrassing in hindsight than it was at the time. In reviving the idea, Origami Angel treat it with the playful, goofy-ass sensibility that it deserves, making them more likely to avoid being ruthlessly mocked.    ""Self-Destruct"" achieves the improbable feat of turning a panicky metal riff that sounds like Despised Icon into a sweetly satisfying pop chorus. Plucky little falsettos contrast with a chug-chug breakdown on ""Tom Holland Oates."" Thrash-and-grind drums mix with happy-go-lucky melodies on ""Dr. Fondoom."" When the hardcore buildup of ""Isopropyl Alchemy"" kicks into a major-key thump, it's bound to elicit a giggle and a ""hell yeah.""    Meanwhile, the band pull out all of their old tricks. These are songs about fun and friendship, with plenty of references to Pokemon, Gameboy,  Star Trek  and late nights of soft drinks and junk food. They pour one out for Eddie Van Halen with dizzying feats of guitar-tapping, and Heagy flexes his impressive ability to pack a ton of words into a catchy melody, the syllables flowing off his tongue with the effortless fluidity of Busta Rhymes on highlights like ""You Won't"" and the Brazilian-tinged ""Bossa Nova Corps.""    There's a lot going on in this roller coaster of a record. ""Caught in the Moment"" channels Four Year Strong, ""/trust"" folds in some Owen-style indie-folk, ""[spoons rattling]"" starts with trip-hop and takes a sudden turn into mosh-call hardcore, and ""Footloose Cannonball Brothers"" has the radio-friendly pop-rock grooves of Fountains of Wayne or Weezer. The wonderfully endearing ""Neutrogena Spektor"" sounds a bit like  Pet Sounds  plugged into a nuclear reactor with its relentlessly quick tempo and rapidfire rhymes (including ""pterodactyl"" with ""asshole,"" which is awesome) before they tear it down into a metalcore beatdown à la Code Orange.     GAMI GANG  is action-packed and relentlessly entertaining, and the band rips through 20 tracks with great efficiency. With so much happening, it's inevitably not as musically or thematically concise and poignant as  Somewhere City . While that debut had a sad sense of nostalgia to go with its theme of ""eternal youth and the promise of escape,""  GAMI GANG  is entirely devoted to the rambunctiousness, adventurousness and uninhibited amusements of being young. As a punk album, it's like a room full of toys: You can pick up wherever you want and play for as long as you like, and you're bound to end up with a smile on your face.

2021-05-01,Alex Hudson,7,"JUNE 2021 ISSUE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Weezer Aren't All That Heavy on 'Van Weezer,' and They're Better for It",,"Weezer 's hard rock and metal influences have long served as a cheeky counterpoint to their pop geekiness: they name-checked KISS on their first album, embraced heavy fuzz riffs on 2002's  Maladroit , and titled their 2010 B-sides comp  Death to False Metal .     Van Weezer  takes that heavy undercurrent and makes it the focus. The album is full of shredding solos, riffs cribbed from Ozzy Osbourne and lyrical allusions to metal. But don't be fooled: for the most part, this is just the same old Weezer with added two-hand tapping. That's a good thing, since the half-hearted metal schtick is mostly just an excuse for frontman  Rivers Cuomo  and his bandmates to crank their amps and play the power pop they do best. It's a less radical experiment than this year's all-acoustic, orchestra-assisted  OK Human .    Lead single ""The End of the Game"" is an accurate primer for what lies ahead: the twiddly tapping and grandiose drum hits wink at metal, but the song eventually settles into chugging rock with a golden melody and sun-kissed harmonies. ""All the Good Ones"" is only hard rock in the poppiest, stomp-stomp-clap sense (think ""Beverly Hills"" except good), and  ""I Need Some of That""  is a jangly pop tune that's light and breezy even by Weezer standards. Final track ""Precious Metal Girl"" is a classic acoustic closer à la ""Butterfly"" or ""Endless Bummer.""    Ironically, the group only lose their way when they actually embrace  Van Weezer 's concept on the album's middle stretch. The gimmicky ""Blue Dream"" rips its guitar lick from ""Crazy Train,"" and its aggressive pulse and silly aquatic lyrics don't play to Weezer's strengths. ""1 More Hit"" has Metallica-esque palm muting, which might be a good thing if not for the lyrics about drug dependency, which come across like a stylistic exercise in being badass rather than an actual commentary on substance abuse.    But as Cuomo sings on ""Sheila Can Do It,"" which features an intro of motorbike revving and a beautiful straight-outta- Blue  melody, ""She looks like she's having fun / And I don't see the problem with that."" Weezer are goofing around with some of their favourite influences, and their excitement is contagious.

2021-05-03,Allie Gregory,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Squid Forge an Optimistic Path for Post-Punk's Future on 'Bright Green Field',,"When  Squid  were forced out of their gigging circuit because of the pandemic, they were also removed from their de facto focus groups: bars and venues around England where they'd test new tunes, experiment on stage and gauge their audience's reaction. As the global lockdowns of 2020 set in, they went underground — literally — to Speedy Wunderground producer Dan Carey's basement studio and set out to record their debut full-length album,  Bright Green Field .    The ambitious, experimental outing from the English five-piece, who have harnessed the brighter side of post-punk's pop sensibilities, represents a shift in not only the group's process, but also within the genre.     It's easy to draw comparison to Squid's contemporaries on their full-length effort; the record finds the band teaming up with Carey, whose influence on  Bright Green Field  is mirrored in the works of the producer's other English buzz-rock collaborators including black midi. There are also parallels in Squid's sound to the likes of Parquet Courts, Protomartyr and IDLES, as well as veteran post-punk/new wave outfits like Talking Heads and Joy Division.    All these groups share a similar frenetic agitation, and often, a sense of restlessness and displeasure with society at large; but where Squid's predecessors lean toward solemn, grey sonic palettes, the Brighton-formed band latch onto brighter, optimistic tones. There's no mistaking that the group demonstrate critical views through drummer/vocalist Ollie Judge's dystopian, industrial lyricism, but they've presented much of their politics through infectious, danceable riffs and electronic experimentation, ditching the monotone, binary formulae of the past.    Eight-minute standout ""Narrator,"" featuring the undulating siren call of guest vocalist Martha Skye Murphy, is the record's clear winner, but it's no anomaly. ""G.S.K."" falls mostly in line with the album's foundations in painting industrial soundscapes. Driving mid-album slapper ""Paddling"" is likely the purest instance of Judge's signature bossy lyricism, while closer ""Pamphlets"" (one of many album cuts touting a seriously lengthy runtime) is an undoubtedly rebellious decry of the status quo.    On  Bright Green Field , Squid offer a response to the dance-rock of the early-aughts' call. Their sprawling, tangential compositions — rooted in groovy, pulsating drum lines, sassy-yet-authoritative vocals and resounding brass — are destined for indie dance parties of the near-future's post-vaccine nightlife. And where the album's more erratic moments are bookended by remarkable restraint, making space for the band to soothe their own anxieties, they forge a new path for post-punk's optimistic future.    Removed from the institution of performance, they've taken a step back from the genre's plague of cool-for-coolness-sake. Here, they embrace vulnerability, taking time to address modern issues (read: symptoms of capitalism), while also imbuing a real sense of fun, artistic merit and instrumental democracy in the record's 11 tracks.

2021-05-03,Kyle Kohner,9,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",McKinley Dixon Delivers Impressive Hip-Hop Storytelling on 'For My Mama and Anyone Who Look Like Her',,"Death hangs heavy in the mind of rising Virginia rapper  McKinley Dixon . In 2018, his best friend was killed, which Dixon describes as feeling like ""brass knuckles with shards of broken home to the dome,"" on ""make a poet Black,"" the lead single from  For My Mama and Anyone Who Look Like Her .    The weight of this death can be felt from the first moments of opening track ""Chain Sooo Heavy."" Dixon is a wordsmith in full command of both narrative and atmosphere, and while this free-jazz track threatens to be disorderly with drums shuffling in every which way and loose-cannon saxophone startling at every corner, Dixon checks the unkempt compositions with measured and precise raps about the commodification of Black trauma.    Dixon bites back, clenching each beat with frothing teeth as he speaks to himself from the past, encouraging a young Dixon to ""Orchestrate the way we live / maneuver through the pain that they give."" But the track soon becomes lethargic and drab. The briskly spoken Dixon hits a wall, and his metaphorical chain begins to weigh him into an abyss with sluggish backing vocals materializing this descent into reality: ""Holding me down, down, down, holding me down."" It leads listeners into the dark realm of the record, unbound by time and overcome with fear, mental illness and intergenerational trauma.     Dixon delivers bars with the utmost confidence, but his bravado, deceptively ballooned by spirited jazz arrangements, is constantly under siege by festering anxiety and doubt. ""Bless the Child,"" for example, moves from pastoral and dreamy to anxious and urgent when the pressures of ""making it"" overwhelm the rapper's mind. As a choir swarms in the background, mimicking the sound of ancestors singing from above, ""We're counting on you,"" the stresses of overcoming generational curses are too overbearing to ignore, pushing Dixon into a headspace of profound uncertainty: ""Praying somehow this shit is going to work.""     The disquieting fear swirling inside Dixon's imagination seeps into ""Make a poet Black,"" a cryptic cut where Dixon switches between two different personas as if he's fighting off inner demons. With descending strings, slow marching drum shuffles, darting piano keys and Dixon's cartoonish voice, ""Make a poet Black"" is not only one of the more sonically unique tracks on the album, but it's also the most lyrically tense and dense. Dixon displays his deepest insecurities, like the validity of his success as an artist as it coincided with the passing of his friend. Dixon knows the face of his people's perpetrator: ""My n**** ain't inherently evil / Frame the church / Then hang the preacher / Don't blame the hood / Really n****, just save its people."" Still, Dixon burdens himself with saving them himself. This piles on the pressure and self-doubt ten-fold, thus beckoning the familiar tap of death's finger upon Dixon's shoulder.    Even on ""protective styles,"" a comparatively light and airy song dressed up by dreamy choral vocals and delicate slacker rock guitars, doubt and frankness leak from its shimmering protective layer. The track's underlying message is inherently encouraging as he urges the necessity of therapy in Black communities, as Dixon delivers brutally honest bars about how, even when there's sunshine, the night will come. Dixon's verses throughout this record depict a weathered poet made weary by righteous gnawing and clawing for answers. But as is the case when fighting for justice, there must be room made for self-care.      The frustration and exhaustion expressed across  For My Mama and Anyone Who Look Like Her  eventually reaches a tipping point — not of anger, but of pure tenderness. Eventually, Dixon arrives at a moment of genuine reprieve and unfettered reflection upon the day his best friend died. On the harpsichord-bolstered ""Mama's Home,"" Dixon rests. He turns to his mother, asking her to keep the demons at bay as he is ""trying to process this the best he can… but can I break down for a second?""    Dixon's storytelling shines throughout this whole album. He not only has a compellingly verbose and, at times, boastful rapping style, but he also wields an impressive level of lyrical complexity. The emcee operates with a film director's eye, one that places himself in the actor's shoes, often offering multi-pronged characters that aim to make sense of himself and those who look like him.

2021-05-04,Oliver Crook,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Fiver and the Atlantic School of Spontaneous Composition Twist Country Music into New Shapes,,"When a band first starts out, or is looking to take their act to the next level, common wisdom is to learn some covers. Lose the stress of writing and just rock some of your favourites.  Fiver  (the solo moniker for Toronto indie folk auteur Simone Schmidt) and the Atlantic School of Spontaneous Composition (a backing band composed of some of the East Coast's best indie musicians) did just that with last year's genre-reimagining  You Wanted Country? Vol 1 . It worked, and now, the four-piece are even tighter on this self-titled collection of majestic originals.    Throughout the album, the Atlantic School — Bianca Palmer, Nick Dourado and Jeremy Costello, who list Beverly Glenn Copeland, Aquakultre and Century Egg amongst their musical adventures — weave beautifully improvised riffs and purposeful wanderings to create an ideal bedrock for Schmidt to do what they do best: croon powerful, thoughtful lyrics. In their sights this time? The very real idea of 21st century labour struggles and the ethereal concept of living in the now, entangled poetically like only Schmidt can. The band's masterful command of improvisational music complements this well. Stunning interplay between Schmidt's words and their band's music creates the album's most magical moments, especially in those special instances where it all melds into one.     Taking what they learned together on  You Wanted Country? Vol 1 , the eight songs of  Fiver with the Atlantic School of Spontaneous Composition  sit in a country framework without ever feeling constrained by it. At any moment, a song feels like it will lurch out of its Waylon Jennings tribute into a swirling, psychedelic trip. They live up to the spontaneity promised by their name, and the album is all the more exciting for it. You can hear this with the cosmic-slide guitar of ""Leaning Hard (On My Peripheral Vision)"" that carries listeners to faraway lands, or the soul-stirring melody of ""Jr. Wreck."" Album standout ""Paid in Pride"" finds each musician doing what they do best, as you hear the band's country foundation creaking but never breaking.     This changing of style has become Schmidt's calling card; their work as Fiver and full-band project  the Highest Order  has found them never sitting in one sound for long. Like a Canadian PJ Harvey, Schmidt comes, hears and conquers, before moving onto a whole new project.  Fiver with the Atlantic School of Spontaneous Composition  is melodic and slow, with the subtleties like to pass listeners by on first listen. With each spin, the album's underbelly is revealed, showcasing a world of activity and adventure begging to be enjoyed.

2021-05-04,Luke Fox,6,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Commerce Trumps Art on DJ Khaled's 'Khaled Khaled',,"DJ Khaled  albums are like Michael Bay movies, as many have noted over the years. Familiar and fun. Loud and glossy. Predictable in their relentless attempts to astonish with explosives and draw a wide-net audience with expensive star power. And they always drop just in time for summer. Blockbuster status.     Days are growing longer. Windows are rolling down. And barbecue season is nigh. So, it's only a semi-surprise that hip-hop's most gregarious and connected DJ-slash-producer-slash-adlibber-slash-hypeman-slash-proud daddy-slash-Instagram beacon has walloped us with another one.    Exchanging concepts for collabs, statements for stunt shows, Khaled has adopted the mixtape-style LP format popularized by New York tastemakers like Funkmaster Flex and Kid Capri in the '90s and aimed squarely for the pop charts. Armed with the most enviable Rolodex in the biz, the 45-year-old matchmaker isn't so much interested in putting on a region (early Khaled LPs helped put Florida rap acts on the map) or breaking new voices as he is curating sonic events.     The formula is a simple one: artists you know and love + samples you know and love = no-brainer hits tugged from the roots of nostalgia. Literally any one of the 14 tracks on  Khaled Khaled , the DJ's 12th album, could spring up on your FM dial with ease. Khaled's procession of anthems kicks off with ""Thankful,"" featuring  Jeremih  and  Lil Wayne . The warm, soulful opener borrows Bobby Bland's 1974 cut ""Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City,"" which was famously sampled on Jay-Z's 2001  Blueprint  burner ""Heart of the City (Ain't No Love).""      Another  Blueprint  favourite, ""Song Cry,"" forms the foundation of  lead event/video ""Sorry Not Sorry,""  the first link-up between enemies-turned-titans  JAY-Z  and  Nas  in 13 years. Here we're treated to light  Beyoncé  harmonies and two measured doses of grown-man investment raps. ""Winner in life, fuck a coin toss / I'm coin-based, basically cryptocurrency Scarface,"" Nas boasts. It's not so much about what's said as who's saying it.     The repurposing of past hits from the late '90s and early '00s doesn't stop there.  H.E.R.  and  Migos ' ""We Going Crazy"" updates Shawty Lo's ""Dey Know""; ""This Is My Year,"" with  A Boogie wit da Hoodie ,  Big Sean ,  Rick Ross  and  Puff Daddy , snatches Biggie's ""Long Kiss Goodnight""; and the Justin Timberlake solo ""Just Be"" pales in comparison to Ghostface Killah's ""All That I Got is You,"" which siphons leagues more emotion from the Jackson 5's ""Maybe Tomorrow"" loop. None surpass their predecessors.     More compelling is ""I Did It,"" in which zeitgeist superstars  Megan Thee Stallion ,  Lil Baby  and  DaBaby  take turns splashing quick, personality-drenched verses over Derek and the Dominoes' rocking sample.  Post Malone  holds the thing together with a very Posty hook. The highest peaks are reached by Canadian contributors.  Drake 's  ""Popstar"" and ""Greece""  — which teased this album some nine months ago — remain two of the more unique offerings in terms of composition and flow. And the unlikely  Justin Bieber – 21 Savage  duet ""Let It Go"" get addictive as screen time. Another standout is dancehall closer ""Where You Come From,"" featuring Jamaican hall of famers  Buju Banton ,  Capleton and Bounty Killer .     Of course, the whole experience is extravagant and indulgent. Commerce is pulling more gears than art here. Simply skip the lows and ride the highs. Because when Khaled does hit, it can still be fun as hell, like gorging on popcorn and 'splosions.

2021-05-04,Nicholas Sokic,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Sufjan Stevens Writes His Own Holy Books on 'Convocations',,"Two days after the release of his last record,  The Ascension ,  Sufjan Stevens ' father died. That was the impetus behind the composite monolith  Convocations , a five-volume, 49-track, two-and-a-half hour instrumental album. Stevens is no stranger to an instrumental or experimental project, but he's never put out anything this vast. Meant to represent the five stages of grief, label Asthmatic Kitty describes the album as ""a reflection on a year of anxiety, uncertainty, isolation, and loss.""    That's certainly apt, for all of us. Without a word, the spectre of death and heartache haunts every track. But the project is far from an ambient, meandering funeral dirge. The first volume  Meditations , is appropriately, well, meditative. It takes four songs for any significant chord progression to be introduced, the first three largely being claustrophobic, atmospheric strings. Under the lens of all five parts, this makes sense, although it can take a while to get to the interesting bits.     Lamentations , with its droning and buzzing loops, feels like the listener is adrift in a rudderless monotony. This opens up to more pianos and strings and by ""Lamentations X,"" something akin to the aftermath of emotional catharsis. Of course, processing grief isn't really something that happens in recognizable stages, and there's three volumes to go.    The entire album is steeped in religiosity, which is a given considering Stevens' own Christian faith he's previously explored on record.  Revelations  embodies most the seeking that is inherent to any faith, via its Biblical title and the introduction of synths reminiscent of your archetypal church band, namely bells, organs and chants. It's not quite apocalyptic, instead anxious and striving for meaning.     Throughout all volumes, Stevens gives his quote unquote realistic synths a slightly unreal quality, as if one's world is ever so slightly off-kilter.  Celebrations  puts this aspect front and centre. The loops are more frequently interrupted by aberrations, particularly in the back half. The anxiety of  Revelations  does not entirely dissipate by the next volume. The hymns are glitched; there's poison in the prayer.    Final volume  Incantations  combines elements from each of its predecessors: a dawning realization, a chance at release, lingering unease and the possibility that this could all begin again tomorrow. In the aftermath of any loss, there are more questions than answers, and these five volumes offer more of the former. Your reception towards  Convocations  will depend on your patience, your tolerance for experimental albums, and whether you're even a fan of Stevens' instrumental work to begin with. If you're not, then Stevens exploring grief via Brian Eno-style minimalism is not going to be what swings the pendulum for you. For Stevens' disciples though, there's enough here to warrant a poring over reminiscent of the same given to holy books.

2021-04-26,Daniel Sylvester,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Cadence Weapon Is as Clever as Ever on 'Parallel World',,"Although each  Cadence Weapon  album could be billed as his 'return to form,' the truth is that the Toronto-via-Edmonton rapper has never lost his form in the first place. But it may be the infrequency in which Rollie Pemberton releases his albums that makes each one a standout event.    On his fifth full-length,  Parallel World , you can tell just how hard Pemberton works on his craft, ensuring the album's 10 tracks don't just pass by passively. His beats are exploratory, his flow enormously flexible, his guests relevant and his lyrics eloquent. Although it's been three years since  his stellar self-titled album , Pemberton has kept himself extremely busy. He's made music with Montreal electronic producer  Jacques Greene , acted in  Sean Nicholas Savage 's  Please Thrill Me  musical,  written a forthcoming book , been a mentor at the Banff International Songwriter Residency and  advocated for the Edmonton CFL team's name change . This may be why Pemberton sounds so confident and poised on tracks like on the rubbery tongue-twister ""Play No Games.""    Although the record clocks in at a brisk 27 minutes, Pemberton nonetheless packs the album with a bevy of ideas and moods, from the brief Kool Keith-style futurist opener ""Africville's Revenge"" to the minimal whisper rap closer ""Connect."" Though the music of  Parallel World  is powerful, the message is infinitely more so. The bouncy ""On Me"" (featuring grime MC Manga Saint Hilaire) has the duo rapping about facial recognition technology's links to racial discrimination, while the plain-spoken but commanding ""Skyline"" explores Pemberton's struggles with gentrification within the city of Toronto, featuring the immortal couplet, ""Ford Nation's for the corporation but he don't care about the public / Whenever we ask for what we need he says there's no room in the budget."" ""Eye to Eye"" explores his fear of being targeted by the cops for the colour of his skin. Even when Pemberton switches gears to boast on the dank ""Ghost"" (featuring a bone-shaking turn from  Backxwash ) and the jittery ""Hard to Find,"" he still manages to come off commanding and stimulating.    Although producers Greene (on the aforementioned ""SENNA"") and Jimmy Edgar (on the Fat Tony-guesting ""Water"") disappointingly deliver of-the-moment trap beats that just yearn to sound dated by decade's end, Pemberton still figures out how to save those tracks with his buoyance and clever songwriting skills. While it's true that Rollie Pemberton is known to release music on his own unpredictable schedule,  Parallel World  proves that a Cadence Weapon record is always an event.

2021-04-26,Manus Hopkins,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Gojira Display Plenty of 'Fortitude' on New Album,,"All too often, extreme metal acts are ceilinged at a moderate level of success. It isn't surprising to see a band like Gojira — 25 years and seven albums in — plateau in popularity and spend the rest of their career playing the same venues and pulling the same figures. But if anyone has a shot at breaking this mould, it's Gojira, and  Fortitude  could be the album that does the trick.    The songs all play into and build on each other well, fitting together despite the wide array of stylistic elements heard across them. The thunderous ""Born for One Thing"" starts the record on a strong note, complete with massive riffs, pounding drums and earth-shattering vocals, before ""Amazonia'' shifts gears into a environmental anthem that's progressive in every sense of the word (it was released along with a fundraiser to benefit the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil) and ""Another World"" drips raw, unfiltered emotion. More melodic cuts like ""Hold On!"" and ""The Trails"" aren't necessarily more gentle than the heavier tracks, but show a more nuanced side of Gojira's well-rounded sound without slowing the record's momentum or diminishing its intensity.    One of the best moments comes midway through the album, when interlude ""Fortitude"" gives way to ""The Chant,"" an arena-sized song with what might be the biggest chorus in Gojira's entire catalogue. The same goes for several of the tracks, and the deeper the album goes, the more it feels like one big picture rather than a collection of individual songs. Closer ""Grind"" concludes the album perfectly, seemingly summarizing the album by bringing together all its atmospheres into one final burst.     One of the best things about  Fortitude  is the creative uses of numerous guitar effects and spot-on tones. For the guitar geeks, digital effects company Neural DSP has a package of digital plugins called the where these sounds can be found. The various distortions, flangers and reverbs serve the riffs incredibly, as if they were written with the exact sounds the final product would contain in mind. The production at times sounds a little too clear, as if some grit could give the songs more attitude, but the band still sounds absolutely massive, just as they do live.     Fortitude  is an album that takes a few listens to fully wrap one's head around, and there's no denying just how much there is to be heard in these 11 versatile tracks. If there was any doubt still about Gojira's potential,  Fortitude  proves unequivocally that the band are MVPs of modern metal. They've held their own as openers for Metallica's Canadian dates on their WorldWired tour, stolen the show at massive festivals like the 2018 edition of Heavy Montreal, and now, have released one of the year's most important heavy music albums.

2021-04-26,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,5,"MIXTAPE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Lil Yachty Is Upstaged by Everybody Else on 'Michigan Boy Boat',,"""I ain't never got the respect that I truly deserve"" is the opening line of ""Final Form,"" the first salvo from  Lil Yachty 's latest mixtape,  Michigan Boat Boy , an homage to the Wolverine State's burgeoning rap scene. Armed with a more aggressive delivery than his previous work, the Atlanta rapper presents a project that is meant to put Michigan on the map. Yachty rekindles the natural chemistry he fostered in past collaborations with Detroit heavyweights  Tee Grizzley  and Sada Baby and brings more obscure MCs YN Jay, RMC Mike, KrispyLife Kidd and Rio Da Yung OG to the forefront throughout the tape.    Fundamentally, this unselfish approach is what may have contributed to one of the mixtape's ominous flaws: the fact that Yachty is outshone by almost all the featuring rappers on the tape. This has more to do with Yachty's lackadaisical writing and mostly offbeat flows than any outstanding performance by Michigan artists.    That is not to say that  Michigan Boat Boy  does not have any redeeming qualities. ""G.I Joe"" is a bonafide banger and worth the price of admission alone, and Yachty's beat selection seldom misses throughout the tape. The same discerning taste that feeds his infamous sneaker collection allows the listener to enjoy innovative production and avoid run-of-the-mill percussive patterns. Unfortunately, the lazy lyrics on ""Concrete Goonies"" ruin its refreshing beat, and the collaborative ""Never Did Coke"" with California-based  Swae Lee  (of  Rae Sremmurd ) is both stylistically and geographically out of place.    Yachty has built a career on his unique voice and solidified a following while his label carefully crafted his image and made the most from his idiosyncratic personality. Since 2016's  Lil Boat , Quality Control Records earned their namesake by providing solid projects to Yachty's loyal fans, albeit without being able to reproduce the commercial success of his debut. With  Michigan Boat Boy , there is a painfully apparent lack of oversight, as Yachty can be heard laughing and scuffing up bars on some songs. This type of laissez-faire attitude may work for artists who have established their sound, but it is quite risky for a young MC who has yet to shake off his 'flavour of the month' reputation.    The mixtape format may excuse the lack of sonic cohesion for the project, but it does not explain the faltering artistic direction that is more than likely to leave Yachty's fans disoriented and disenchanted. With his recent collaboration with Reese's Puffs and  some movies in the works , Lil Yachty seems to be reaching his pop cultural potential — regrettably, this latest outing does nothing to further his musical one.

2021-04-27,Rachel Kelly,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",girl in red Gently Screams into the Void on 'if i could make it go quiet',,"After a rocket-launch start with multiple viral songs and over a million TikTok followers,  girl in red 's  if i could make it go quiet  is a surprising yet authentically jaded debut album. The Norwegian singer forgoes the tenderness and acoustic arrangements that made her an indie pop darling in favour of riot grrrl-influenced punk stylings. It may be early in girl in red's career for a rebellious phase, but she justifies it by balancing catchy poeticism with danceable rage and brutal honesty.    Sparse, rhythmic arrangements blend with her distorted, sing-song vocals to create a sound just familiar enough to keep old fans happy while embracing a new sense of maturity and earned anger. In the album, she openly processes mental illness in tandem with fame, heartbreak, desire and growth, all the while bristling with painful self-awareness and Gen Z nihilism. She oscillates between indignant rage and self-loathing, mining emotional depths to produce a gentle scream into the void.    As always, girl in red's greatest accomplishment is her lyrics; she is an expert at packing a punch in as few words as possible. This gives the album an air of authenticity where other young artists often fall into cliché. The best example of this is ""Did You Come?,"" a furious and sardonic track about sexual betrayal where she sings, ""Did you come? How many times? / Tell the truth, wait never mind."" Bald, explicit sexuality is a signature of her writing, repeated in ""hornylovesickmess"" where she laments using a former love for sex, and ""You Stupid Bitch,"" where lust reaches a furious fever pitch. She takes this bluntness into every song. The album's crowning achievement, ""Serotonin,"" is an irresistibly catchy, angsty track about the realities of mental illness. Produced by hit-maker FINNEAS, the song pleads for relief in a raw, painful way: ""Like how do I make this stop / When it feels like my therapist hates me / Please don't let me go crazy.""     Occasionally, the album does dip into sickly sweetness. ""I'll Call You Mine"" and ""Apartment 402"" feel a little hollow in their positivity when surrounded by masterfully described pain. Despite this,  if i could make it go quiet  is a testament to girl in red's rapid growth as an artist. In addition to a sophisticated examination of anger and suffering, her voice has grown richer and deeper while her sound has evolved to blend punk nostalgia into her youthful ennui. It is a special accomplishment that she can hold so much duality in her music: retro yet current, blunt yet poetic, angry yet tender.

2021-04-27,Louis Pavlakos,8,"R&B,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",K. Forest Is a Breath of Fresh Air to Toronto's R&B Scene on 'Welcome to the Wildfire',,"After Drake and the Weeknd rose to stardom with their lovelorn, pop-tinged R&B, it unleashed a storm onto their hometown of Toronto. The city became increasingly known for its ability to churn out hopelessly romantic singers — while some have managed to carve their own path out like Daniel Caesar, others sound too similar to their forebears. Enter  K. Forest : a crooner from Toronto who effortlessly balances sensuous bedroom-ready tracks and vulnerable ballads dedicated to the women in his life. On  Welcome to the Wildfire , the follow-up to 2018's  Forest Fire II , he firmly establishes himself as one of the city's most intimate vocalists and songwriters.    The album begins with the braggadocious ""Offshore,"" arguably the album's least intimate track, which focuses on how much more lavish his life has become. He isn't interested in showing his love; rather, the opener is a reminder that K. Forest is here and that the next 30 minutes will be spent living in his world. He understands his desirability and his self-indulgence is apparent across the brief 10 tracks, especially on ""My Turn Interlude"" and ""D.B.L,"" the latter of which is about pressuring his debtors to not be late on his payments. These are the few spots on  Welcome to the Wildfire  that deter from an otherwise honest and vulnerable affair.    K. Forest is at his apex when he's crooning about lost love, especially shown on ""Summer We Never Had."" The sensual bedroom jam is a story of reminiscing, the tale of a past love that sees him yearning for a summer spent together. This fictitious narrative K. Forest created in his head only has him languishing over a puppy love that ended right after Toronto's notoriously cruel winter and before a more promising summer. Even if that means just spending time together in an empty parking lot, his desire for it is still strong.    Most of  Welcome to the Willdfire 's themes are accomplished when K. Forest is in his loverboy bag. His songwriting proves that he's not just a playboy, but someone who actually wants to be present for his partners. His lust for love is palpable. On ""Snowstorm,"" he longs for someone in another country who he's barred from seeing her thanks to the ongoing pandemic: ""As soon as I cross the border / We'll be crossing the line / It's been a while since I showed up.""    K. Forest doesn't reinvent the R&B wheel with  Welcome to the Wildfire , but he breathes fresh air into a sound that Toronto artists have beaten into the ground. His tender songwriting and laidback instrumentals are the perfect combination for a Valentine's Day-ready album that came a month too late.

2021-04-27,Adam Feibel,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Manchester Orchestra's 'The Million Masks of God' Plays Out Like a Life Lived from Beginning to End,,"Manchester Orchestra  began a new era of their career with 2017's   A Black Mile to the Surface . It was an atmospheric, cinematic work that recast the grungy, pop-compatible Atlanta alt-rockers as pensive storytellers whose music could reach profound depths and triumphant heights. That has now proven to be not an ambitious, outlying experiment, but the new template for Manchester Orchestra records going forward. With its philosophical concept and grandiose production,  The Million Masks of God  attempts to build on its predecessor's dramatic theatre.    The songwriting duo of Andy Hull and Robert McDowell appear to have permanently reframed their approach, influenced especially by their experience in film scoring. In contrast to the electrifying guitar-rock of Manchester Orchestra's first four albums, their recent work is far more focused on textures, atmospheres and abstract storytelling.  The Million Masks of God  is a loose dramatization of a man's encounter with the ""Angel of Death,"" who shows him a variety of scenes from the entirety of his life. While the band was working on the album, its concept took on deeper meaning when McDowell's father died of cancer. The group spends these 11 songs confronting their mortality, processing their grief and examining their faith, and the record plays out like a life lived from beginning to end; it starts with a rush of vitality and is filled with moments both quiet and chaotic before eventually slowing to its final breath.    Helmed by an accomplished production team of Catherine Marks (the Killers, PJ Harvey) and Ethan Gruska (Phoebe Bridgers),  Million Masks  is extremely dynamic, a meticulously designed sonic field full of peaks and valleys and a variety of landscapes in between. In ""Obstacle,"" the twinkle of an acoustic guitar works its way into a big, rousing crescendo, finding them halfway between Mumford & Sons and Band of Horses. In ""Annie,"" the slithering prog-rock of the verses and the light-as-a-feather harmonies evoke both Tool and Simon & Garfunkel. Manchester Orchestra are masters of dynamics, rising and falling with finely tuned intuition.    Sometimes, the songs are so enveloped in multi-layered arrangements and soundscapes that you can barely hear the rock band underneath. There's the spacey, densely echoing ""Inaudible,"" the haunting, withdrawn intensity of ""Dinosaur,"" the captivating emptiness of ""The Internet,"" and the warm, tender folk songs ""Telepath"" and ""Way Back."" Other times, the band's overdriven guitars and rhythmic rumble are so out-in-front that there's no doubt they're still the rockers they've always been, as on the atmospheric grunge of ""Angel of Death,"" the plucky groove of ""Keel Timing,"" and the electronic beat of ""Bed Head."" These are songs that put them in the arena of Silversun Pickups and My Morning Jacket but also dangerously close to Muse — a direction you might justifiably consider if you're writing dystopian sci-fi rock, but perhaps not so much if you're portraying a godly man's deepest ruminations on life, love and faith.     Manchester Orchestra's sixth album is a bit difficult to assess. There isn't a song as gripping as  Black Mile 's exultantly hymnal ""The Maze"" or darkly powerful ""The Gold,"" but there are plenty of interesting ideas and a vision that seems almost fully realized. The music can be too knotty and scattered and the lyrics too opaque and impenetrable to reflect the album's weighty themes.  The Million Masks of God  goes for an emotional gut-punch, but it's a bit light on impact. Much of the power of this music comes from the mind when it ought to come from the soul.

Her previous album, 2017's  Place Holder , delivered smart, amped-up folk, but  With Pleasure 's 10 songs traverse pop, soul, R&B and rock en route to resonant sentiments, backed by a range of musicians — six are credited across the album — to shape its sounds in myriad ways. The expanded palette serves VISSIA well; the heart pulls one in many directions, so why shouldn't music do the same?    Opener ""Doorway"" finds her sorting through lingering memories of a past relationship before shifting into a guitar-and-organ kiss-off that underscores its end: ""You could never offer me the key / To the rest of our lives."" ""My Wom"" is a strutting ode to one who's ""Fine on her own / But she knows how to hold space,"" and ""Take It Apart"" layers urgent synth and bass into spry '80s power rock, complete with a guitar solo.    These big, kinetic moments all land well, with VISSIA's singer-songwriter eye for detail anchoring the range of styles in vivid lyrical strokes. As a result,  With Pleasure 's more reflective songs offer further richness: ""Walk Me Home"" sorts through personal highs and lows in a bent-not-broken piano ballad, culminating in a realization: ""Never thought I'd find a way to love every person I've become."" ""Never Gonna Be the Same"" renders an ode to an imperfect connection — ""Maybe we weren't good for each other / But I know we are still good people"" — in breezy soul. And after the celebratory bounce of ""High with U"", ""About Moving On"" closes the album on a softer, drifting comedown of unresolved feelings.    But  With Pleasure 's finest two moments are its most cathartic. ""On My Mind"" is a rush of exhilaration from start to finish, its magnetic vocal hook coasting over a pulsing dance beat, while the neo-soul of ""The Cliffs"" splits at its chorus like rainfall over an arid prairie drought. It's a brilliant moment in an album full of them, showcasing VISSIA's growing command of multi-faceted pop.

2021-04-28,Calum Slingerland,6,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Dawn Richard Can't Live Up to Her Own Ambitions on 'Second Line: An Electro Revival',,"Between 2013 and 2016,  Dawn Richard  used electronic music as bedrock in chronicling personal and professional trials over a trilogy of acclaimed albums, staking her claim as an R&B innovator, style fusionist and futurist in the name of artistic freedom. Further coronation came with 2019's  new breed , a more direct embrace of her New Orleans roots that now inform  Second Line: An Electro Revival .    As its subtitle implies, electronics are what drive Richard's King Creole alter ego — the armoured, feathered figure illustrated on the album's cover — through the set of songs inspired by the titular parade tradition that, as Richard's mother explains in a clip of conversation, has no ""set steps."" But as the dance goes on,  Second Line 's sound and spirit seldom reach the fever pitch of the artist's prior electro excursions.    Richard first commands listeners to get up and move with a slick suite of dance numbers to open the album, backing up her character's introductory proclamations: ""The movement is me,"" and, ""I am the genre."" The mid-tempo groove and twinkling synths of ""Nostalgia"" allow listeners to find their feet in time for the pumping ""Boomerang,"" accentuated by mesmeric vocal harmonies, steady bass, whip sounds and whistles.    ""Bussifame"" is another compelling call to get down, as its shifty beats and house chords pair with Richard's raps for a skilful build to ""Pressure,"" a dynamic dance floor reprieve achieved through dialling back the BPM of bounce claps and footwork drums to bolster affecting vocals. ""Jacuzzi,"" sandwiched between a pair of brief interludes, revels in innuendo as Richard heats things up for a lover to ""hit it like a snare"" and ""go pound for pound"" in between saucy dancehall choruses.    From there,  Second Line  shifts away from beat-driven structures to place feel over form. Those aforementioned interludes feel underdeveloped here — unlike past inclusions, which were strong enough to stand as their own musical ideas, or serve as a smooth segue between tracks.    ""Pilot"" and ""FiveOhFour"" are short-changed by quick fadeouts and bland beats, while ""Le Petit Morte"" hinges more on the listener being able to recognize Beethoven's piano than key in to Richard's powerful vocal. Both ""Voodoo (Intermission)"" and the later ""(Outermission)"" don't see their striking melodies developed beyond brevity and repetition.    Synth bass and lead glides of ""Radio Free"" and ""The Potter"" point towards an emotional summit that doesn't arrive, as instrumentals inadequately back Richard's messages of love, loss and resolve alone. The lengthier ""Mornin/Streetlights,"" ""Perfect Storm"" and closer ""SELFish"" suffer similarly in spite of their beat switching, tending to let production set a mood as opposed to pushing the songs beyond the grooves into which they have settled.    New label home or not, Richard remains a testament to boundary-pushing, genre bending and expectation-shattering art, though  Second Line 's tempered grandiosity ultimately leaves her ambition underserved.

2021-04-28,Calum Slingerland,8,"HIP-HOP,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,R&B,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Rochelle Jordan Pushes Her Artistry into Bolder Territory on 'Play with the Changes',,"As labels courted  Rochelle Jordan  and primary collaborator KLSH in the time following her 2014 solo debut,  1021 , the two concurrently became friends and collaborators of  Machinedrum  and  Jimmy Edgar . Across the producers' solo outings and projects including  JETS  and  Sepalcure , Jordan's airy vocals and incisive delivery have remained a highlight, growing more potent with each team-up.    It's an arrangement that is now explored at album length on  Play with the Changes , as Jordan brings her closest conspirators together to further push her artistry into even bolder, more adventurous territory. The musical blueprint of the Scarborough-raised, L.A.-based vocalist's second LP maps hip-hop, house, pop, garage and drum 'n' bass — all deftly blended by her lineup of electro-fusionists — to set up Jordan to tread vibrant and vulnerable emotional territory on her most colourful, confident recordings to date.    Where  1021  took its time ramping up to quick tempos,  Play with the Changes  wastes none, as the endorphin rush of ""LOVE U GOOD"" is ushered in by a twitchy breakbeat, filtered keys and bass smears, as Jordan's conversational words of comfort float atop it all. The garage-inspired ""GOT EM"" raises the stakes as Jordan takes the wheel to weave through knocking rhythm and melody alike, reminding herself every so often to ""push it to the next lane"" out of self-love. ""NEXT 2 YOU"" and ""ALL ALONG"" both revel in excitable feelings with production to match; the former with its yearning synth stabs and shifty percussion, and the latter with a new jack snare that bounces lightly enough to avoid sounding dated.     Play with the Changes  stacks its soul-baring moments in its middle portion, led by ""BROKEN STEEL."" Over an affecting chord progression, Jordan cleverly twists pronunciation in detailing the pressures of living up to the ""strong Black woman"" trope — metaphorically, one who is ""super tough and made of silver stuff."" She charts this internal dialogue in the chorus: ""Better shut my mouth / If I say my feelings then they'll say that I'm too loud / Blend into the crowd / Once they see my colour then they'll think that I'm too proud."" Farrah Fawx — who had her 2019 single ""Never Thought"" helmed by KLSH and Edgar — turns in a nimble verse ""with the weight of the world on [her] hips"" sharing her own struggles on the LP's lone guest spot.    ""NOTHING LEFT"" works a breathy vocal sample, robotic percussion and heavily filtered synths to create the sound of exhaustion, as Jordan sings, ""I drown myself in you, there is no life here."" ""LAY"" forgoes drums entirely for further lyrical emphasis as Jordan wrestles with police brutality. In fearing for the safety and security of a loved one away from home, she pushes her range in the chorus to sing ""You're safe with me when I'm watching you sleep.""    At times when Jordan's attitudes are more ambivalent, she writes from a point of awareness in making sure she isn't the one getting played. On ""ALREADY,"" she pushes back on a lover's about-face in cool, rhythmic fashion, giving a final kiss-off with an even icier outro rap. With ""SOMETHING,"" Jordan ""[plays] this game like a poker deck,"" leaving an either-or entanglement up to luck of the draw. The detailed ""COUNT IT"" soundtracks Jordan tucking cash under the mattress for her own safekeeping, betting you'll be mesmerized by a chorus that evokes falling bills, in which she affirms, ""If you ever leave, I might be lonely / But if you ever leave, I won't be begging."" Edgar's penchant for wonderfully warped synths and metallic synthesis drive his daring  CHEETAH BEND  album from earlier this year, on which Jordan also stars.     Play with the Changes  is a testament to both the friendship and musical flexibility Jordan has found, and continues to build with all involved; bonds that carry the album's range of emotions and electronics beyond dance floors to heads and hearts effortlessly.

2021-04-28,Yara El-Soueidi,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Kristian North Transcends His '80s Influences on 'Passion Play',,"It's always interesting when an artist decides to branch out from their signature style, seizing an opportunity to further explore their universe. While not all of these experiments can be successful, some are worthy of interest and hold up pretty well in the long run.  Kristian North , formerly of garage-punks  Babysitter , offers the exact opposite of what he's known for on his solo debut, and it certainly delivers. His latest musical offering,  Passion Play , is another example of North's brilliant talent in a different style.    On this album, North transforms himself into a modern-day crooner, ready to seduce anyone with his raspy, deep voice. His album is filled with electric retro energy down to the smallest detail. The album opener, ""Fantasy,"" is a very sexy song with an excellent groove. ""Shadow of the Pyramid"" is a delight thanks to North's voice and the accompanying synths.    North doesn't just stick to funk and new wave songs. He also explores the traditional '80s power ballad with ""More Than Yesterday."" From the first note, everything about this slow track reminds us of the closing song of a Brat Pack movie or an '80s romantic comedy. His voice slows down, languishing for his lover. The whole album shines because of North's ability to dive into emotions directly through the arrangements in addition to the lyrics.      Passion Play  is a top-notch album, showing us that the influence of the '80s is still alive and well. But it isn't just a rehash of the past; it stands on its own terms thanks to North's marvellous performances and boundless creativity. Grab your shiniest clothes and lose yourself to dance.

2021-04-29,Ian Gormely,8,"ALBUM,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,MUSIC,JAZZ",Joseph Shabason Turns Ambient Jazz into Personal Memoir on 'The Fellowship',,"Joseph Shabason  has spent much of his career in service to others. Whether it's through his work as a member of synthpop group  DIANA , sideman in  Destroyer  or session musician, the Toronto-based multi-instrumentalist Shabason is an ace at helping others realize their artistic vision.  So it should come as no surprise that for his solo career Shabason tends to dig deep into his personal life for inspiration. 2018's  Anne  focused on  his mother's memories of her childhood as well as her struggles with Parkinson's disease . He goes back to the family well again on  The Fellowship , this time digging into his own upbringing in a dual-faith household in suburban Toronto. Though raised in traditional Jewish households, his parents adopted spiritual Islam in their 20s and raised Shabason and his sister with both religions. His childhood, he says, ""was pretty wonked.""    You can trace the evolution of Shabason's thinking across the record's eight tracks, opening with ""Life with My Grandparents"" and the anxious ""Escape from North York."" Shabason is best known as a saxophonist, an instrument he frequently layers with effects here, essentially transforming or obscuring its natural sound. It's augmented by keys, flute, vibraphone, and even guitar from Thom Gill, among other contributors.    But the album's heart is the three-song suite consisting of ""0-13,"" ""13-15"" and ""15-19,"" where questioning turns to rejection. ""So Long,"" the album's winding denouement, finally breaks the tension that's been quietly building over the previous 30 minutes, offering listeners a sense of relief they didn't necessarily know they needed.    Compared to your average pop record, instrumental jazz and ambient music, the wells from which  The Fellowship  sprung, can be intimidating. A trained musician, Shabason knows these worlds well and can speak, both musically and in conversation, to the genres' giants. But the record's narrative throughline gives listeners who are more familiar with Shabason's work as a session musician and sideman an easy way into this world.    This makes  The Fellowship  the best kind of record regardless of genre. The emotions that are being expressed feel lived-in and deeply personal while remaining open to listener interpretations. The specifics of Shabason's story are unique, but most people will have encountered some crisis of conviction in their adolescence, be it one of faith or otherwise.

2021-04-19,Daniel Sylvester,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Dinosaur Jr. Don't Mess with a Good Thing on 'Sweep It into Space',,"Thirty-six years in and it's finally time to rightfully name  Dinosaur Jr.  'the AC/DC of indie rock.' While each have maintained a hefty career and undying fan base simply by sticking to a specific formula, the Amherst, MA trio's shifting sound would only be precipitated by the influx and departure of band members, much like their Aussie counterparts.     Sweep It into Space , the band's 12th studio album and first in five years, benefits from the solid lineup of  J Mascis ,  Lou Barlow  and Murph — the band's founders who have appeared on every LP since their 2005 reformation. Set into motion at the end of 2019, the 12-track LP was originally slated to feature major contributions and co-production from singer-songwriter  Kurt Vile  along with keyboards from longtime collaborator Ken Maiuri. But as the pandemic hit North America, the trio instead hunkered down in their regular Bisquiteen Studio to record, with Mascis playing many of the riffs intended for Vile.    The twin guitars give much of the LP a beefier sound, as ""I Met the Stones"" profits from a Stooges-style chug that finds Mascis trading his typically strained guitar solo for tight verse-flanking leads, while ""Walking to You"" features a cavalier forward-moving swing rarely heard on a Jr. album. Vile's nominal contributions, namely the twangy 12-string guitar on ""I Ran Away,"" adds a spangled countermelody to Mascis' regular word salad mumble, while J's turn behind the digital Mellotron for the jaunty ""Take It Back"" allows the trio to lay back and glide through one of their most airy tracks to date.    Although Barlow has mostly sounded uninspired on his last album with his other band,  Sebadoh  (2019's  Act Surprised ), the bassist's obligatory pair of vocal turns — the soaring ""Garden"" and the yearning closer ""You Wonder"" — each rank as album highlights thanks to robust choruses and impassioned deliveries. But aside from the few aforementioned departures of formula, much of  Sweep It into Space  comes off as archetypical Dinosaur Jr. The punchy ""Hide Another Round"" finds Murph delivering machinegun drum fills on cue, while ""And Me"" delivers such a textbook J Mascis solo that you swear it's pulled note for note from an older track.    While long-gone are the sonic textures of the band's early years — replaced here with some novel and resourceful instrumentation — the group's second (and now longest) run has been unbelievably solid and unimpeachable. Over the past 16 years, Dinosaur Jr. have learned not to mess with a good thing. And  Sweep It into Space  is undoubtedly a 'good thing.'

2021-04-19,Allie Gregory,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Maude Audet Makes a Successful Play to Anglophone Audiences with 'Translations' of Her French Originals,,"Revisiting her French-sung 2020 album,  Tu ne mourras pas , and other previous works, Montreal pop-folk songwriter  Maude Audet  has offered up a collection of her tunes rewritten for English listeners, aptly titled  Translations . Audet enlisted bilingual singer-songwriter  Carole Facal  for the expertly translated works, and through their partnership, the pair have succeeded in opening up Audet's catalogue to Anglo audiences.     From the record's opening guitar on ""You're Shaken"" to her closing cover of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" Audet's affinity for minor-key sentimentality serves up more of the retro pastiche originally cast into the ether with her original records. Here, she offers morose-yet-hopeful tones backed by jangly guitar and banjo, delivering chamber pop palettes with assistance from a string section, organ player, gongs, flutes and a veritable euphony of other traditional instruments.    The sonically decorated orchestral work, however, manages to remain sparse in its arrangements, offering a delicate nine tracks led by Audet's whispering vocals inflected with her Francophone accent. Without relegating Audet's work to the category of English-sung French music, it's hard not to draw comparisons to France-born psych-popster Melody's Echo Chamber. But where Melody Prochet's catalogue embraces more psychedelic influences and '60s pop, Audet counters with dreamier, airier tones akin to Belle and Sebastian, with lyrics grounded in whimsy and romance.    Standout track ""In the River"" brings Audet's romanticism to the fore, embodying the comfort of being loved with the metaphor of being enveloped in water, an ageless tangible entity contrasted against other intangible human forces. Harnessing more of that spiritous, silky energy, Audet breathes new life into her ode to Leonard Cohen with the album's English-translated ""Leo Leo,"" of which the original was written the day after the Canadian music legend passed away. Concluding with her Nirvana cover, the record ends off on a diminished, poetic note.     Translations  does have its moments of flatness, but if Audet set out with the goal of seducing English-speaking audiences, with this record, it's likely she'll succeed. This is companion music to soundtrack moments of light summer breezes, brushing sun-warmed bodies suspended in waterside hammocks. The gentleness, the bewitching detachment Audet propagates on this album translates well — regardless of whose mother tongue it's sung in.

2021-04-20,Jonathan St. Michael,6,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Cities Aviv's 'The Crashing Sound of How It Goes' Is Too Rough Around the Edges,,"There comes a certain kind of creative freedom when hip-hop artists are able to bridge the divide between the roles of rapper and producer. Many of the most successful acts in hip-hop were at the hands of rappers who could not only provide verses and vocals for their tracks, but who also had complete creative control in creating and producing their works.    With rapper-producer  Cities Aviv , his musical output has always emphasized this creative freedom; with avant-garde production style and distorted vocals, his projects are often expansive and experimental. On his latest album,  The Crashing Sound of How It Goes , Cities Aviv explores his distinct sound with an ever-growing collection of sample-heavy and ambient melodies.    Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Cities Aviv (a.k.a. Gavin Mays) has already dabbled with a multitude of musical styles. With influences spanning from Memphis-based hip-hop outfit Three 6 Mafia to shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Cities Aviv's music can be seen as fairly unorthodox. Although rooted in hip-hop,  The Crashing Sound of How It Goes  is tinged with elements of soul, jazz, dub, and punk. And while previous albums such as  Come to Life  showcased Cities Aviv's punk influence in full display, recent releases have mellowed out considerably, capturing his ability for crafting jarring and melodic mixes.     The Crashing Sound of How It Goes  is an exploration of Cities Aviv's production abilities; ducking and weaving through ambient interludes and doses of heavily reverbed vocals, the album veers into elements of jazz and soul, as Aviv crafts an immense soundscape through layered soul samples and atmospheric verses. With just over an hour of runtime, the album features some of the artist's most textured and layered instrumentals to date. However, while the songs themselves do capture moments of pensive reflection, the style seldom varies, with many tracks so drenched in loops and delay that they can hardly be differentiated from one another.    The vocal delivery is sparse, with many muffled verses inevitably getting lost amidst the existing mix. However, the tracks which do feature more cohesive vocals, like ""Love. Fool. Revue."" and ""My World Is Full,"" are examples of how Cities Aviv can use vocals to ground a song without relying too heavily on them. Some instrumental tracks such as ""Face Pressed Against Glass"" and ""How We Began"" are blissful and melodic, with the latter using distorted vocals as means to add texture and richness to the arrangement.    In its entirety,  The Crashing Sound of How It Goes  is an intriguing foray into experimental hip-hop production, but often ends up sounding muddled and disoriented. While many of the album's eccentricities are undeniably fresh,  The Crashing Sound of How It Goes  feels too rough around the edges to fully capture its best features.

2021-04-20,Mark Tremblay,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Big Brave Find Their 'Vital' Heavy Voice,,"Big Brave  are consistently in a state of self-discovery. Since the release of their second record, 2015's  Au De La , the band has pushed the concept of a three-piece rock band further from the norm.  Vital , the band's latest offering, has fully abandoned normal song structures and distilled them into concise drone metal bursts.  Vital  takes a lot of risks that pay off immensely.     Unlike many of their drone music peers, Big Brave pride themselves on being very succinct when creating their soundscapes. Many of  Vital 's climactic moments are fairly unconventional in heavy music, and yet make for exceptional emotional resolutions. ""Half Breed"" sonically builds towards a whispering vocal outro that chillingly dissolves into ""Wited, Still and All...."" Moments like these are heavier and darker than what most metal bands pull off using walls of distortion.    All of the instrumentation works to highlight Robin Wattie's voice, and lyrically,  Vital  is the most profound in Big Brave's catalogue. According to the band, the album explores the weight of race and gender, endurance and navigating other people's behaviors, observation and protest. Wattie's voice is the focal point of the album, hauntingly drifting over chimes and bells in ""Wited, Still and All"" and cutting through the noise on ""Of This Ilk.""       Vital  has riffs, too. ""Of This Ilk"" is built on a foundation of bludgeoning sludge, while the album-closing title track is the most metal-leaning song in Big Brave's catalogue as waves of distortion, feedback, and bell sounds engulf the song's most cathartic moments. Even though there are few distinct chord progressions throughout the entire record, Big Brave are able to express so much using recurring sounds throughout the record.     Vital  is a culmination of Big Brave's dedication to find their unique voice in the realm of heavy music. Big Brave are able to achieve so much using so little. Through loud and quiet dynamics, and incorporating minimalism, Big Brave's  Vital  is one of the most impactful records in the band's catalogue.  ( Southern Lord )                           METAL AND HARDCORE   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Big Brave",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/big_brave_vital_album_review

It was 2016, and he was feeling listless a few shows into a tour for an album that wasn't doing very well. Wandering around a local mall, d'Ecco had a sudden urge. He ducked into a wig store and picked out a black bob, grabbing a stash of makeup on the way. ""I don't know what I was going for,"" he said in a  2018 interview with  The Georgia Straight , ""but I was like — fuck it!""    So goes the story of how d'Ecco transformed himself from bearded rocker to glam rock character — pageboy-meets- Rocky Horror Picture Show . When he premiered the persona on his 2018 album  Trespasser , critics and listeners talked about the way he looked just as much — if not more than — the way he sounded. Now, with his appearance well-established, d'Ecco looks to deepen his musical craft on  In Standard Definition , a kinetic concept album that offers a suitable showcase for his arch performance.    The raw materials for  In Standard Definition  emerged while d'Ecco was in transit. Travelling and touring, he found himself jotting down fragments of melody in motel rooms — the hum of a television set constantly in the background. d'Ecco became hounded by the ubiquitous streams of media that followed him from place to place. ""We're constantly… consuming various forms of entertainment,"" he said in a press release, describing the ideas behind the album. ""We feel less close with each other, and closer to the strangers who make us feel good.""    That's a pretty broad, paint-by-numbers concern about the modern age and it may not seem like sufficient fodder for a compelling concept album. Fortunately,  In Standard Definition  prefers to explore its ideas in sonic rather than literal terms. Over the course of the album, d'Ecco clicks through 12 tracks of glam rock, as if holding a TV remote behind his back. Occasionally, the album tunes in to instrumental interludes, like ""Channel 7 (Pilot Season)"": a cinematic synth loop that could easily have been pulled from the  Twin Peaks  soundtrack.    When those interludes fade out — and d'Ecco's voice breaks in — it arrives as instrument of its own: low in the mix, a unit of sound more than meaning. At times, d'Ecco is all percussion, landing hard on syllabic pairs: ""Night fall / It's on,"" ""I need / your kind,"" ""A thought / surmised."" Elsewhere, on ""Birds of Prey,"" his voice becomes pure opera in a careening falsetto, gazing down on the guitar line below.    Certain threads of ideas — TV, media, celebrity — gradually accumulate across the record. All three converge in ""TV God,"" whose lyrics warn forebodingly of the titular deity, described as ""that face… on the channel."" The album's title track approaches similar cultural obsessions with a hazy, nostalgic bent. ""We're turning out to an old-time movie,"" d'Ecco says with a sigh, ""French cinema with the volume off.""    It's a classic scene for d'Ecco, who has never hidden his longing for the past.  In Standard Definit ion furthers his desire, through a new (or, rather, old) production process. Recording for the album was done in analog, a result of a collaboration with producer Colin Stewart — known for his work with Destroyer, among others. The effect is a set of tapes wound with energy, suffusing the record's calculated structure with flashes of organic movement.

In 2019, Thugga managed to reach the commercial potential he had always harboured with his 'debut' album,  So Much Fun . Meanwhile, labelmate and protégé  Gunna  showed no signs of slowing down after his explosion onto the U.S. rap scene, but the global pandemic halted the entire YSL Records camp's momentum.     Nevertheless, with the release of  Slime Language 2 , a follow up to the  iconic 2018 compilation , both rappers have firmly solidified their stronghold on the game. Young Thug showcases his A&R talents and manages to blend percolating young talent with established superstars with Gunna leading the helm throughout the 23-track trap opus.    In the streaming service era, a truly unskippable album with one song blending into the next is an impressive feat in and out of itself. Young Thug and Gunna take it a step further by expertly selecting beats that create a variety of moods and suit the participants to a tee. Heavyweight guests  Future ,  Drake ,  Lil Uzi Vert  and  Travis Scott  each feature on songs that would easily make the cut on their respective solo projects. The 6ix God is right at home on the aptly titled ""Solid,"" which will undoubtedly be blasting through car sound systems across North America this summer. Standout track ""Came and Saw"" is the perfect vehicle for recently freed Brooklyn rapper Rowdy Rebel to make his anticipated comeback while British MC  Skepta 's verse on ""WokStar"" keeps the momentum going midway through the compilation.    However, the album is not simply an amalgam of high profile features. This project serves as a platform for up-and-coming artists (YNW Melly, Coi Leray) to meet with veterans ( Kid Cudi ,  Big Sean ) and allows YSL Records' rookie roster of artists to shine. Additionally, the finely curated production on  Slime Language 2  provides a perfect snapshot of the evolution of Atlanta's sound.     The family portrait-style cover art suggests this was a labor of love for Young Thug, who manages to pull off an almost perfect project, with the exception of lyrical missteps by  NAV  and a tendency for repetitive and uninspired hooks on a few songs. Regardless of these slight blemishes,  Slime Language 2  proves that Thugger and Gunna are keeping their eyes on the prize.

2021-04-20,Matt Bobkin,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",DijahSB's Vulnerable Hip-Hop Will Keep Anyone's 'Head Above the Waters',,"DijahSB  is masterful at making hard times sound good thanks to their potent combo of vulnerable, heartfelt rhymes and upbeat, groove-laden beats. Last year's  2020 the Album  and  Girls Give Me Anxiety  EP took a sketch comedy approach to life's many woes, touching on a variety of topics in brief vignettes, never giving an idea too much bandwidth before moving on to the next. The one-two punch of releases helped to establish Dijah as a fresh, independent force in Toronto's buzzing hip-hop community, weaving in feel-good wordplay with a healthy dose of reality.    Less than a year later, Dijah's back with  Head Above the Waters , a tight jazz-rap song cycle with the singular focus of staying resilient amid today's unending parade of bad news. Where last year's tracks went all-in on the causes of Dijah's consternation — like financial hardship on ""I'll Pay You Back on Friday"" and ""Broke Boi Anthem"" or relationships on ""Girls Give Me Anxiety"" —  Head Above the Water  sidesteps the specifics to focus instead on establishing a sustainable mindset.    It starts with Cheap Limousine's and  Harrison 's production, a series of laidback beats awash in live instrumentation, where wistful guitar licks and keyboards provide a relaxing foundation for Dijah's words. Though  Head Above the Waters  repeats its central motif frequently throughout its 24-minute runtime, it's hardly one-note or repetitive. Forgoing the conceptual breadth of Dijah's earlier work, guest appearances and radio-ready singles provide enough kick to the album's therapeutic baseline. Uptempo cuts like ""Throw That Back"" and ""Overtime"" feature smooth rhymes and indelible grooves, while a trio of guest performances from fellow Toronto artists on the rise find Dijah in good company. Most notably,  Terrell Morris ' turn on ""New Harrison,"" which finds him peppering his swift verse with clever millennial TV references, provides an energetic counterpoint to Dijah's more lowkey delivery.    But Dijah doesn't need guest stars or flashy hooks to stand out. Deeper cuts like standout ""Way Too Many Ways"" give Dijah ample space to do what they do best — rap about their feelings with no-frills candour: ""People gravitate towards me now because I know depression / I be talking bout the harder parts that no one mentions."" And later, ""Know that this is deeper than rap / this the same shit that keep me relaxed / so just relax with me."" Dijah's willingness to dig deep into their complex feelings means each bar has plenty of power. Meanwhile, Cheap Limousine's detail-rich production — with '80s slap bass, synth wash and guitar wails — means there are plenty of grooves to dig into if Dijah's bars get too real. Its endless playability ensures that their struggles and perseverance will find their way into listeners' ears eventually.    Dijah's tracks have always lent themselves to easy listening, but through their unbothered flows and complementary beat selection,  Head Above the Waters  is soothing and satisfying — where their previous projects succeeded by speaking the truth about Dijah's problems,  Head Above the Waters  succeeds by being a cure in and of itself, a balm for troubled times both in its vulnerability and poised, easygoing demeanour. ""It's a new era, new coast and new seas,"" raps Dijah on closing track ""Big Waves,"" like a sigh of relief during the final leg of a lake swim. ""Head above the waters, I finally see the shores."" Listeners will too.

2021-04-21,Safiya Hopfe,7,"JAZZ,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Alfa Mist's Nostalgic 'Bring Backs' Is a Celebration of Origins,,"Alfa Mist  discovered jazz through hip-hop. Growing up, the English multi-instrumentalist came across records by the likes of Hi-tek, Madlib and J Dilla, and sought to understand their origins. The world behind the samples began to reveal itself to him, and he decided he wanted to inhabit it, too. Mist taught himself to play piano, and began beat-making and improvising jazz by himself.    By 2017's  Antiphon , he had perfected a stylistic fusion of jazz and hip-hop that was unmistakably his. Balancing instrumental improvisation and an intricate rhythmic awareness with spoken-word fragments and lo-fi beats, Mist's sound came into its own with stunning subtlety.     Structuralism , released in 2019, did more of the same, blending conversations with family and warm riffs to create something at once raw and refined. In 2020, he teamed up with soul singer Emmavie to produce the vibrantly melancholic  Epoch , only a couple of months after putting out  On My Ones , an EP-length love-letter to the piano in which he fully embraced the vulnerability of minimalism.    Not much has changed since Mist's breakthrough album. His new record,  Bring Backs , recreates familiar melodic loops, and listeners are accustomed to his precise way of layering sound against distorted conversations. But Mist makes some space for the unexpected here. The poetic verse of ""Mind the Gap"" — a collaboration with Lex Amor — is a rare showcase of his prowess as a rapper, while ""Once a Year"" makes an unexpected detour into orchestral strings. ""Attune'' epitomizes the magic that occurs when Mist plays freely in improvisational space without aiming for symmetry. Throughout  Bring Backs , Mist meditates on temporal space, transformation, and the inevitability of returning, time and time again, to where one once was.    Perhaps, Alfa Mist is less concerned with moving forward than he is driven by nostalgia and a passion for origin stories. From the sentimental family dialogue he has woven into past records to his fixation on the place from which hip-hop beats emerge, it is easy to presume that Mist's work is inspired more by what has been than what could be. After all, possibilities for invention abound in what appears fossilized. Mist is still an experimentalist, based on his daring union of musical worlds. However, his work remains achingly aware of the traditions it is indebted to.    This spirit of remembrance is strong on  Bring Backs , just as the title suggests. Mist's first release on Anti- after years of self-production on the Sekito label, the 9-track LP grapples with the spirit of growing up and the ongoing instabilities of the immigrant experience. Mist ponders his personal past while exploring his early musical background. The result is at once a collage of instrumental influences and a sonic diary of the trials that have shaped him.     Bring Backs ' centrepiece is a poem by Hilary Thomas, which taps into the struggle of existing between cultural worlds. It is the liminal pulse of a record tense with the conflicting promises of past and future. The poem's final line is ""Time is a healer, when there's no turning back."" Alfa Mist weaves masterfully from threads of nostalgia, but  Bring Backs , when you unravel it, is more of an ode to faith and resilience than a mournful remark on what is gone.

2021-04-22,Wesley McLean,8,"REVIEWS,HIP-HOP,ALBUM,MUSIC",Kenny Mason Makes Hip-Hop and Alt-Rock Cohesive on 'Angelic Hoodrat: Supercut',,"Kenny Mason 's hometown of Atlanta has played a pivotal role in hip-hop culture that is impossible to understate. For the better part of 20 years, the city's scene has provided wave after wave of new artists and superstars who've brought with them new sounds and ideas, impacting the entire genre with their creativity and innovation. Mason embodies that eclectic and forward-thinking spirit, forging his own diverse sound on his latest LP,  Angelic Hoodrat: Supercut .    Though the album's title might make it seem like this is a deluxe version of 2020's  Angelic Hoodrat , it's not. This is a completely new album that builds on the strengths of its predecessor, with Mason refining his sound further, resulting in the project having a much more cohesive and consistent feel throughout. Even as he fuses southern hip-hop with elements of punk and alternative rock, he's struck a balance so strong that all of the songs fit together neatly.    Mason is so comfortable with the sonic duality that he presents that he can deliver a soulful, horn-laden banger like the Freddie Gibbs-assisted ""Much Money"" and follow it with a full-fledged pop-punk jam like ""Play Ball"" with relative ease. It's an immensely impressive feat — these could convincingly be songs by two different artists in separate genres, but the album is so well-sequenced that they make sense back-to-back.    While that sequencing does play a big part in the success of this album's execution, it's Mason's ability to comfortably perform on each and every instrumental on this project that really ties these songs together. He's just as at home delivering a densely layered and multi-syllabic verse drenched in Lil Wayne-levels of charisma as he is channelling Nirvana in this album's more rock-leaning moments. On top of that, his songwriting ability doesn't falter as he switches genres, remaining consistent throughout most of the album.    Whether rapping or singing, Mason's lyrics are his strongest suit, tackling topics like religion, racism, systematic inequality and his observations on life in Atlanta. A lot of these songs have an undeniable sense of rage and sadness pervading through their lyrics, and these emotions are perfectly accented and emphasized by Mason's delivery and the soundscape that he's created for himself. He knows what he wants to say and exactly how to present it to make it as impactful as possible.    It's this clear and extremely well-executed vision that Mason has that makes  Angelic Hoodrat: Supercut  so impressive, especially so early in his career. By playing with the duality present in his fusion of southern hip-hop and alternative rock, Kenny Mason has given his music a singular sound that makes him unique and exciting.

2021-04-22,Kyle Mullin,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Korea Town Acid Toggles Between the Gritty and the Avant-Garde on 'Metamorphosis',,"The splendor of Seoul's nightlife is vividly evoked on  ""Bounce.""  But this is, thankfully, not the Seoul that some Western listeners might expect to find. The second single from Toronto producer  Korea Town Acid 's latest album,  Metamorphosis , ""Bounce"" sizzles with reverberating bass, shudders from abrasive key notes, and reels from featured British-Korean rapper Pianwooo's careening bars. Those edgier elements are joltingly contrasted with melodic synth spurts. The music video follows suit with shots of the South Korean capital's shimmering skyline, juxtaposed with cybergothic scenes. ""Bounce,"" like much of  Metamorphosis , is far removed from the posher K-Pop or 88Rising trap sweeping the international mainstream. Instead, these 10 tracks beckon the uninitiated into the Asian diaspora's endlessly innovatively underground.    The Seoul-born, Toronto-based Korea Town Acid (born Jessica Cho) achieves this feat by applying her improvisational live music experience to electronica and hip-hop hardware, composing intricately unpredictable soundscapes rather than relying on loops. The singular results prompted Canadian rap mainstay Cadence Weapon to recruit the up-and-comer to build one of her dystopic beats for his upcoming album,  Parallel World . Stunning as that behind-the-scenes contribution is,  Metamorphosis  makes a case for Korea Town Acid's own time in the limelight.    Standout track ""Into the Future"" sizzles and squeals like a circuit board on the fritz, as hauntingly dissonant drones meld with vocals that don't merely sound altered, but shone through a prism until they flare anew. ""There's No Turning Back,"" meanwhile, sports purring synths and humming keys, along with rapidly rattling percussion, recalling a souped-up Kawasaki weaving through traffic-clotted Tokyo. And then there's the echoing, steel drum-evoking percussion on ""This World Is Sick,"" reverberating at a cool distance, as if on guard from the title's notion.    Yes, her eclectic compositional skills are nothing to scoff at. But Korea Town Acid boasts an equally impressive knack for gripping juxtapositions throughout Metamorphosis. Prime example: the swelling distortion mingling with classical piano sprinkles on ""Eclipse,"" as South Korean rapper PNSB spits with growing aggravation. Better still, however, are the crisp hip-hop drums and sci-fi synths of ""Curtain Call"" suddenly giving way to breezy retro-jazz piano in the closing quarter.     With her teaming of improvisation and electronica, incorporation of hip-hop into the cutting-edge, and her effortless toggling between the gritty and the avant-garde, Korea Town Acid self-assuredly strides into the spotlight with  Metamorphosis .

2021-04-22,Chris Gee,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Fog Lake Finds Strength in Isolation on 'Tragedy Reel',,"If there is one artist who understands unfathomable isolation and falling hopelessly lost in one's thoughts, it's Aaron Powell, also known as  Fog Lake . For almost a decade, Powell has been making downcast, introverted music largely based around his experiences growing up in rural Newfoundland, where Powell spent the summer of 2020 recording his latest album,  Tragedy Reel .    Fog Lake's seventh full-length is Powell's most solemn and sparse work to date, which is saying something coming from an artist who has defined his musical identity by bleak ambient textures dimly passed through melancholic filters. The seclusion is more intensely felt on  Tragedy Reel , soaking into the bones and seeping throughout the mind. While past Fog Lake albums have had subtle, grainy layers of mood-shifting effects,  Tragedy Reel  is relatively clean with little more than guitar, piano and a bit of reverb.  Tragedy Reel  sounds like it was both recorded in a cavernous church and sighed directly into your ear at the same time.    The broad, enveloping strokes on the grand piano creepily lingers and deeply fills the emptiness on songs like ""Sullivan"" and ""June"" while Powell's gauzy, tender vocals barely escape into the air as a faint croon, hardly above a whisper.  Tragedy Reel 's largely glacial pace is its greatest strength — there is nowhere to hide and plenty of space to drift along with Powell's late-night murmurings detailing moments that slipped away and losing feelings of love before fully realizing it.    ""I don't wanna die without knowing you,"" Powell sings on ""Dakota,"" a song about the restlessness of not belonging in any one place and second-guessing choices while trying to reverse them. The delicate banjo and yearning violin creates a cozy sense of home, yet Powell's unease about not having one is a gorgeous, contrasting moment on  Tragedy Reel . Similarly, on album opener ""Crystalline,"" apprehensive tones teeter back and forth anxiously as Powell quietly exclaims, ""no one gets even in this town I've been away from so long,"" before the trauma is temporarily forgotten as a blissful piano outro calms the nerves.    As with Fog Lake's past work, Powell alludes to the smallest glimmer of hopefulness beneath his words of despair. The tiny pitter-patter of a snare at the start of ""Jitterbug"" is played as quietly as possible, mimicking the slightest drops of rain. It works to create a soothing dampness throughout the song, one of Fog Lake's best yet. The piano and guitar are slowed even further to a wispy grey fog on ""Latter Day Saint,"" while Powell's voice is impossibly fragile, careful not to wither away with the gentle descent of its heavenly melody.    Fog Lake's music is about making amends with yourself before you can learn to love the people and environment around you.  Tragedy Reel  shows Powell letting out these emotions in the most direct, intimate way he knows — with minimal, depressed instrumentation and enabling all of the complex levels of sadness to sway together in the shadows.

2021-04-12,Katie Tymochenko,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Paul McCartney Gets by with a Little Help from His Friends on 'McCartney III Imagined',,"It took Sir  Paul McCartney  50 years to complete the  McCartney  trilogy of self-recorded and performed solo albums. Now, with collaboration instead of isolation at the forefront, the songs of  McCartney III  are receiving an upgrade in the form of  McCartney III Imagined , an album of remixes, covers and reinterpretations from some of the world's most respected musicians and producers of various backgrounds and styles. The result is a cluster of McCartney-penned tracks with a sprinkle of personality from each of their new performers.    Eclectic remixes arrive from  Blood Orange  on ""Deep Down"" and  Damon Albarn  on ""Long Tailed Winter Bird."" Here, the album draws a direct comparison to 1980's  McCartney II  by using synthesizers, drum machines and other studio tricks to create a hypnotic daze throughout the record. The remixes prove that a well-written song can be performed just about any way imaginable and still be good, allowing for McCartney's music to branch out into genres otherwise untouched by the 78-year-old.     While new wave and electronica might command earlier parts of this covers album, today's pillars of rock'n'roll are also present. Radiohead's  Ed O'Brien  magnifies ""Slidin'"" into an overly distorted punk rock-inspired performance, while  Josh Homme  from Queens of the Stone Age delivers a subpar rendition of ""Lavatory Lil."" On ""Women and Wives,"" modern rock icon  St. Vincent  turns the track into a soulful song from the '70s but ups the ante with her signature high-pitched vocals and a bluesy guitar solo.    The album's top honour goes to none other than  Phoebe Bridgers , whose hauntingly beautiful rendition of ""Seize the Day"" brings her trademark comforting sense of gloom and darkness to the album. Bridgers intensifies the song's melody and nails down a vocal track that outshines every other remix on the album, an olive branch to the  dad rockers she   keeps feuding with .     McCartney III  is more than your average covers album — each collaborator stretches the skeletons of McCartney's songs into something new, making the album an unconventional collection of tracks that bypass the rules of genre and sonic cohesion. Few will enjoy every track on this album, but it's the versatility and diversity throughout these tracks that truly make  McCartney III Imagined  the record that it is.

2021-04-12,Heather Taylor-Singh,8,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC",Taylor Swift Reclaims Her Past on 'Fearless (Taylor's Version)',,"When the master recordings of  Taylor Swift 's first six albums were  sold to Scooter Braun , Swift promptly announced  she was going to re-record her music . It's fitting that she started with one of her most popular albums,  Fearless , which was released in 2008.  Fearless , Swift's sophomore album, perfectly captured the universal experiences of being a teenage girl — friendships, falling in love, falling out of love and figuring out one's place in this world.  Fearless (Taylor's Version)  is full of nostalgia, but it also creates new memories for Swift and her fans.     Fearless  featured some of Swift's most popular tracks like ""Love Story"" and ""You Belong with Me,"" which she recorded at 18.  Fearless (Taylor's Version)  aims to retain her original vulnerability and honesty, even though Swift is now 31 with far more lived experience. While the instrumentals sound similar, the first notable change is Swift's voice, now wistful yet mature.    Each track sounds smoother and improved, with a refresh on the album's production. Instruments like the banjo and acoustic guitar still shower most tracks, but, like Swift's voice, they sound sharper. Yet, not all the original emotion from  Fearless  is lost. Songs like ""White Horse,"" a track about being let down in a relationship, still feels raw, and ""Forever & Always,"" about Swift's infamous breakup with Joe Jonas, is just as cutting as it was 13 years ago — the same goes for the piano version. Even the laugh on ""Hey Stephen"" still hits.    It's the youthful tracks like ""Fifteen"" and ""You Belong with Me"" that don't feel the same, emotionally. While they're sentimental to listen to, Swift is clearly singing about these moments in retrospect, rather than revelling in her feelings, which comes across in her vocal performance. The naiveties of adolescence and the intense feeling of longing for someone are also captured on certain tracks from Swift's  folklore , but they come from fictional narratives rather than Swift's personal experiences.     On  Fearless (Taylor's Version) , Swift has evolved, and the themes on  Fearless  aren't as relevant to Swift, who sings about her past with new meaning. This is present on ""Change,"" a song initially about Scott Borchetta — the label executive who signed her as a teenager — and Swift's budding career. Due to Borchetta's involvement in Swift's masters being sold, this song offers Swift and her listeners a chance to reclaim the lyrics — change is on the horizon for her career, but in a different way as she sings, ""It was the night things changed / Can you see it now? / These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down."" Being able to hear the empowerment in Swift's voice and shift the meaning of these lyrics is a true testament to her power as a musician.    In addition to the album's 19 tracks from the 2009  Platinum Edition  re-release, Swift included ""Today Was A Fairytale"" from the  Valentine's Day  movie soundtrack and six unreleased tracks ""From the Vault"" of the  Fearless  era. These ""Vault"" tracks are an extension of one of the things Swift does best — write breakup songs. They're a fun treat for fans who can't get enough of Swift's vivid storytelling, from wondering if someone will take you back (""That's When,"" featuring  Keith Urban ) to finally closing the door on a past lover (""Bye Bye Baby""). Swift has always been the master of gracefully singing about heartbreak.     Fearless (Taylor's Version)  introduces her younger audience to an iconic set of songs and feels like pure nostalgia for her older audience. This re-release signifies the beginning of Swift doing things her way, taking full control of her music and sharing it with fans who are eager to listen.

2021-04-12,Vijai Kumar Singh,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Brockhampton Continue to Push Hip-Hop Forward on 'Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine'",,"Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine  is  reportedly   Brockhampton 's penultimate album, with the final album due for release sometime later this year. The past few years have been complicated for the group after  Ameer Vann's ignominious dismissal . Despite the challenges,  Roadrunner  is a concise and focused musical statement that explores nearly every corner of what hip-hop has become in recent decades.    The production is made memorable by its innovative use of instrumentation. Decorations of jazzy saxophones, sexy synths, and warm piano are strewn throughout the project with every song giving the listener a completely different experience. The track ""Dear Lord,"" in particular, departs from the aggressive rap preceding it, giving the listener a jolt of hymn-like choral singing to console a grieving Joba reeling from his father's suicide.    Despite the seemingly chaotic sound of this album, it never feels incoherent. Opener  ""Buzzcut""  best typifies the chaos with a feature from the energetic  Danny Brown . The track begins unsettling and restless, with reverberating bass and Brown's strained vocals, but is later juxtaposed by its denouement into a meditative vocalization with soulful saxophone. With constant ups and downs in energy throughout the project, the meditative voices make a return in the album's closer ""The Light Pt. II"" as Joba and  Kevin Abstract  share introspective bars reliving childhood memories.    There are a number of important features on this album. ""Bankroll"" revives  A$AP Mob  with features from its two most prominent members,  A$AP Rocky  and  A$AP Ferg , with production reminiscent of the Mob's  Cozy Tapes  series.  Roadrunner  is all over the place, in the best way. The song ""What's the Occasion"" showcases heavy rock guitars, ""I'll Take You On"" features R&B vocals from  Charlie Wilson , and ""Don't Shoot Up the Party"" includes a West Coast, G-funk baseline with drums that sound as if they were produced by Kanye West circa  My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . These styles shouldn't work together in theory, yet the particular combinations of sounds are expertly crafted and purposeful.    The lyrical content varies as well, ranging from topics related to race, COVID, suicide, childhood trauma, and more. Upon contemplation of Brockhampton's legacy, especially as their final days are apparently upon them, their greatest contribution to hip-hop has been their LGBTQ representation. It is no secret that hip-hop has been a hostile place for members of the LGBTQ community. Toxic masculinity and homophobia have gone hand-in-hand with the popular hip-hop persona. Gatekeepers have routinely castigated artists who did not possess the requisite machismo. On ""Don't Shoot Up the Party,"" Kevin Abstract takes aim at outdated preconceptions about his sexuality that are prevalent in his community: ""N***** think I think these thoughts on purpose / But I knew 'bout *NSYNC 'fore cash could rule me.""    In recent years, artists like Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, and Young MA have changed how hip-hop talks about LGBTQ artists. Brockhampton, however, not only deserves credit for buttressing LGBTQ artists, but in also addressing America's fraught history with homophobia, a plight that sometimes feels forgotten in the American cultural milieu. Abstract discusses the unique intersectionality of being Black and gay in America: ""And these days no license, only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin' / Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him,"" he raps on ""The Light Pt. II.""     Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine  achieves artistic exploration while maintaining the unmistakable hip-hop aesthetic without it feeling pretentious or forced. Experimental hip-hop projects tend to subvert the genre to the point of unrecognizability, which might be the point. Brockhampton's latest project pulls from varied sources of inspiration to make an undeniably hip-hop record.    Given that this is set to be one of the last releases under the Brockhampton name, the sentimentality is setting in for fans. In what appears to be one of their final outings, Brockhampton is giving their listeners the best they have to offer, which makes anticipation for their next album even stronger.

2021-04-13,Max Heilman,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Montreal's Spectral Wound Will Quench Anyone with 'A Diabolic Thirst' for Black Metal,,"No matter how many subgenres pour out of black metal, there's always a place for groups like  Spectral Wound  to keep the foundational flame alive. With its ferocious primitivism and thoughtful riffage, the Montreal band's 2018 sophomore album,  Infernal Decadence , made waves beyond the Canadian underground. It clearly got the attention of Profound Lore Records, as Spectral Wound now present their third album as one of the label's most emphatic new signings.  A Diabolic Thirst  rises to the occasion as genre purism done correctly.    Opener ""Imperial Saison Noire'' epitomizes all of the key tenets of black metal for uninitiated and veteran listeners alike. Amid blistering blast beats, surging tremolo riffage and wraith-like shrieks, Spectral Wound's balance of rawness and clarity is impressive. The band tightly executes thrashing rhythm changes and eviscerating guitar leads while remaining true to black metal's crude origins.    ""Frigid and Spellbound"" further emphasizes the effectiveness of the band's approach. Its main riff reinforces Spectral Wound's catchy songwriting underneath vocalist Jonah Campbell's glass-gargling screams. True to its name, ""Frigid and Spellbound"" feels like wandering through an oppressive blizzard, guided by the light of a Carcass-esque refrain. Uptempo punk beats and multi-part harmonies compellingly contrast with walls of dissonant noise, and that mystical acoustic interlude truly realizes Spectral Wound's dynamic potential.    Though crow caws and unplugged arpeggios recall classic black metal atmosphere,  A Diabolic Thirst  proves itself beyond mere nostalgia. ""Soul Destroying Black Debauchery"" seemingly foreshadows pandemonium, but it's actually a song where Spectral Wound diverts from brazen aggression to let their arrangements breathe. Though not terribly complex, each idea clearly sprouts from a firm grasp of why early Gorgoroth, Darkthrone and Dissection albums remain so timeless. Drummer Illusory peppers over-the-top speed with slower, groovier rock beats, which in turn gives guitarists Patrick McDowall and Sean Zumbusch more avenues to develop their riffs. Bassist Sam is particularly impressive, as he beefs up down-tempo passages and adds extra harmony when the tempo quickens — recapturing the lost art of bass guitar in ""trve kvlt"" music.    The album's natural progression is impressive considering its hellish template. ""Mausoleal Drift"" exemplifies this best, breaching 10 minutes with its 6/8 time signature. Every part of this cut remains vital and necessary, earning its run time by tactfully dealing its cards and saving its most overwhelming riff for last without padding out the length with lesser ideas. It also showcases  A Diabolic Thirst 's multifaceted soundscape, which burns like a blade of dry ice and shrouds like a midnight fog. Most importantly, it maintains a transportive quality without resorting to the tropes of post-rock or neo-folk.    For all its blunt impact, ""Fair Lucifer, Sad Relic'' encapsulates  A Diabolic Thirst 's vivid aura. The track's memorability boils down to a constant state of motion, redoubling its momentum with charging percussion and ever-shifting guitar leads. To a similar effect, closer ""Diabolic Immanence"" bridges the gap between concussive four-on-the-floor and blustery, howling onslaughts. Airtight double-bass drumming and thundering tom-toms kick around everything the guitarists offer, culminating in a thunderous conclusion of cavernous, wretched cacophony.    While back-to-basics metal can seem like a cop-out, Spectral Wound proves their skill and comprehension with every vocal rasp and tremolo riff.  A Diabolic Thirst  succeeds not by innovation, but by distilling the very essence of a musical phenomenon.

2021-04-13,Chris Bryson,9,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Armed Make Themselves Known in a Big Way on 'ULTRAPOP',,"The Armed  are a band known for their elusiveness. The mystery surrounding the extreme group is made up of things like fantastical music videos, Ford commercial nods and intentionally deluding the media about who they really are, all for a greater artistic purpose. It works well for them, and it's all a part of the story that makes the Armed so intriguing, seemingly strivers for a future of music, culture and creativity that's as boundless as their collective vision.    For their new album,  ULTRAPOP , the Armed finally revealed their lineup, which has been ambiguous in the past, and it packs a punch, extending to nine members, including two drummers, four guitarists and six vocalists (several members work double duty) with additional guests. The result is an album further evolved from its predecessors, an experimental vision of hardcore, metal, noise and pop that's equal parts chaotic and elevating, visceral and cerebral, strangely beautiful and masterfully maximal, filled with raw, unbridled energy.    The album's production, with Kurt Ballou once again at the helm, is crisp, precise and devastating. Similar to 2018's  Only Love ,  ULTRAPOP 's tracks are knotty and layered yet woven together in ways that make their music captivating and dynamic, like the punishing bass, dreamy vocals and shapeshifting, sparkling and strident synths of the opening title track, giving a feeling that's simultaneously overwhelming and blissful. ""MASUNAGA VAPORS"" and ""FAITH IN MEDICATION"" wield full-bore hardcore fury that's twisted up by manic guitars and speed-freak drumming, with both elevated by light backing vocals that provide a subtle counterpoint to the vicious rage.    The band's emphasis on the concept of ULTRAPOP comes through a focus on counterculture and a drive to push any notions of genre beyond expectation and to their most intense forms. The group remain a unit with an unmistakably complex sound. And with  ULTRAPOP , they've refined their chaos to the point where their extreme and experimental tendencies are right at home with their pop sensibilities, and many of these songs are melodic and catchy as hell, in remarkably twisted ways. Fierce screams and crushing guitars demolish the ""BIG SHELL,"" while harmonized vocals and relentless and towering instrumentals attempt to lift the deceptions and ""beautiful pain"" of ""AVERAGE DEATH."" ""REAL FOLK BLUES"" embeds buzzing hooks into a harsh and urgent scream-along epic with lyrics, amongst other things, about a strawman in the streets, gold-plated prying eyes and something burning through the skin. Intricate rhythms, tones and electronics clatter, weave and pulse around one of the record's catchiest vocal refrains on ""BAD SELECTION,"" and the album closes with the harsh, pounding and melancholic ""THE MUSIC BECOMES A SKULL.""    The album's lyrics are often bizarre and esoteric. You could parse them for days and still not know for sure what they're about. ""ALL FUTURES"" takes buzzing riffs, rampant energy and lyrics about being anti-capitalist and staying hopeful to anthemic heights, but the phrasings used inject ambiguities amongst more direct notions: ""Caress a monolith / Shape shifted birthing hips / Cut up – Cut out – cut in – it's meaningful if nothing's meant / Maybe a race to nowhere, but I still hope that I win / I'm anti, anti, anti…"" The lyrical puzzles and buried meanings fit well with the band's flair for diversion and challenge-all-expectations ethos, adding an enigmatic layer to their intricate music.     In ""A LIFE SO WONDERFUL,"" hooks and near-inhuman drumming propel the song into one of the band's most ferocious and uplifting choruses to date. Despite the song's title, its lyrics tell a tougher story: ""Addicted till we all got sober / We tried to find a place, start over / A body that keeps getting colder / A fame that's never getting closer."" Nothing is ever as it seems with the Armed, and  ULTRAPOP  is another piece of their mystique. The band's myth and the unity behind it is something that comes out in the spirit and strength of their music, where every part is as important as the other in order to experience the big picture and its full force.  ULTRAPOP  is a beautiful storm, dense, monstrous, vital, and aching to break free.

2021-04-13,Karen K. Tran,6,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Born Ruffians Don't Have Much 'PULP' to Wring Out,,"After releasing  JUICE  and  SQUEEZE   in the past year,  Born Ruffians  conclude their thirst-quenching trilogy with  PULP , a high-energy album that's perfectly suitable for summer road trips and singalongs.    PULP has a strong start with the strum-happy jaunt of ""Checkin' Out,"" following up with more of Born Ruffians' trademark, breezy indie rock on ""Types of People"" and album closer ""Happy Parasites."" Even though the album is short, there are a few valleys with the addition of slower songs ""Heat Wave"" and the sweet ""Husha,"" which are a nice change-up from the Ruffian's usual breakneck pace. Standouts include are ""Ring Finger,"" a catchy clap-along tune with lyrics about people who rush into marriage, and ""Husha,"" which incorporates children's nursery rhyme ""Ring Around the Rosie"" to discuss the aftermath of a breakup.     On its own,  PULP  is short, fast, and sweet — songs like ""Checkin' Out,"" ""Beyond the Lightning,"" and ""Ring Finger"" certainly sound like typical Born Ruffians. However, none of these tracks really break ground or feel compelling enough —  PULP  sounds like a rehash of their usual fare, especially coming so closely after  JUICE  and  SQUEEZE . By releasing the 26 tracks over three albums instead of one lean and polished 12-track album, the too-similar tracks that would have otherwise been left on the cutting-room floor instead come off as filler.    Born Ruffians have really nailed down their sound and can really shine when it comes to what they're most comfortable with, but  PULP  finds them simply doing more of the same.

2021-04-14,Josiah Hughes,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Greta Van Fleet's '70s Rock Cosplay Is Pretty Damn Sick on 'The Battle at Garden's Gate',,"Although it's never really been proven in any quantifiable way, a recent narrative has emerged that show business favours music that has been written and produced to favour the algorithms on streaming services. It's a fun little conspiracy theory for people who can't quite come to terms with the fact that no one likes their band, but even if it's true in some way, what's the big deal? When it comes to music recommendations, an algorithm is far better than any music writer. After all, computer servers aren't trying to get on the guestlist, buddy up with publicists or angle for key follow backs on Twitter. They're simply spying on you to give you exactly what you already want.    Being an algorithm band is one of many charges lodged against  Greta Van Fleet , the pint-sized '70s rock revivalists from Michigan who've faced plenty of scrutiny since emerging with  Anthem of the Peaceful Army , their much-loathed 2018 debut. To be fair, there's plenty to roast about Greta Van Fleet — their desperately retro logo uses the  Stranger Things  font, the songs aren't as immediately catchy as their stadium-ready aesthetic feels and frontman Josh Kiszka's shrieking '70s falsetto usually sounds like too direct of a Robert Plant ripoff, like the band is trying to perform as an awkward stand-in for Led Zeppelin in  That '70s Show .    Criticizing Greta Van Fleet for aping Led Zeppelin can really only last for one album, however. Sure,  The Battle at Garden's Gate  is still packed with Josh's faux-Zep banshee yelps, and when he's not doing Hendrix ""Purple Haze"" chords, his guitarist brother Jake Kiszka digs into plenty of Jimmy Page-esque pentatonic solos on every song (along with drummer Danny Wagner, the band is rounded out by a third brother, bassist Sam Kiszka, which further cements the unspoken truth that these tiny rockers are lowkey adorable). Sure, the riffs sound like they were tailor-made for people who buy classic rock graphic tees at Old Navy. Who gives a shit? The current cool music is either nepotistic rich kids cosplaying as '90s indie rockers or legions of lanky kids with jagged haircuts cosplaying as the Fall or Joy Division or some minor variation in between. Rock music's in a weird place, and while the Lemon Twigs tried to split the difference and bring back the vintage tones of '70s music with similar compositions, they were still trying to play it cool. Greta Van Fleet's rock'n'roll dressup is almost freeing in how embarrassing it is at first — pure cornball earnestness that makes you feel like you're perpetually washing a muscle car on a Sunday afternoon while it's on. And it's pretty damn sick.    If anything,  Anthem of the Peaceful Army  didn't work as well because it was slightly timid, an awkward deer-in-headlights moment from a band who are far too mockable. Fortunately, with  The Battle at Garden's Gate , they've earned more ground by delivering an album that's far more confident, earning the rock schlock with larger compositions that feel more grandiose.    The album opens with a near-perfect three-song run that demonstrate Greta Van Fleet close to the top of their potential. Opener ""Heat Above"" is perhaps the strongest example, a mid-tempo  Houses of the Holy -esque strummer that pairs Josh's falsetto with beautiful acoustic guitars, tasteful timpani, stanky organs and angelic strings that become even more ethereal when joined by a ghostly vocal croon that can only be described as a  Wayne's World  dream sequence. ""My Way, Soon"" ups the tempo slightly, but still demonstrates GVF as masters of the mid-tempo rocker complete with plenty of pentatonic guitar runs. It's walking around music. ""Broken Bells"" is, it must be said, a carbon copy of the ""Stairway to Heaven"" model, building up to an epic solo after creating a vibe with mysterious clean riffing and a huge belt-out from Josh, who sounds like Big Bird getting his foot stepped on. But they squeak by and actually pull it off, in this humble reviewer's opinion. Either way, God bless them for trying.    After a while, the sameness starts to sink in as the band delivers a near comically accurate '70s rock impression over and over again, like they ground up your dad's first Columbia House order into a mulch and built a new CD out of the scraps. ""Age of Machine,"" for example, does not warrant its seven-minute runtime. But there are still plenty of great moments, including some nice rhythmic triplets and a wailing guitar solo. Almost every seven-minute song in history is too long, but at least this one still rocks. Further, when they step out of the  MOJO  mojo, things get even worse, as on ""Stardust Chords,"" where they ruin some nice Mellotron with theatrical yelping that almost sounds like what interpretive dance looks like.    Keep listening, though, and the sameness pays big rewards. ""The Barbarians"" nails the Mellotron rock with a pulsing and rhythmic belter and ""The Weight of Dreams"" is a perfectly complex closer, living up to its comically stonerish deep thought of a title. Then there's ""Light My Love,"" which is hands down the very best song this band has done. The track opens with some nice Band-esque piano but proves to be something of a fake out as the band kick into a swinging rock-ballad. The arrangement is ornate, Josh's croon sits perfectly on the track and it's just, well, an incredibly pleasant listening experience. The song fires on all cylinders and really serves as something of an authenticity test for listeners. Do you really hate this band, or are you worried that you won't seem cool if you admit they're good?    We've been living through the dark ages of rock music, and for good reason — the genre has been wrung out, with every last bit of vitality poured down the drain. Presented as the next great hope for the genre, Greta Van Fleet were bound to be mocked. But as three brothers from Michigan making delightfully strummy mid-tempo guitar solo music, they're really not hurting anyone. In fact, if you can pull yourself away from yet another band that sounds like Public Image Ltd. for a second, you just might realize how great they can be.

2021-04-15,Tom Piekarski,7,"REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,MUSIC",Andy Stott Offers an Excitingly Different Take on His Trademarks with 'Never the Right Time',,"When surveying  Andy Stott 's musical trajectory, 2012's  Luxury Problems  stands like a monolith. With the masterful manipulation of his one-time piano teacher Alison Skidmore's vocals, Stott introduced the dangers of the heart into his bassed-out, inverted club bangers. While that human element has proved undeniable — Skidmore has been present on every Stott full-length since — it is all too easy to mistake the appearance of vocals as some singular watershed moment in Stott's artistic development. Just as crucial is what happened a year earlier, with the release of twin EPs  Passed Me By  and  We Stay Together .    Stott had already been a mainstay of the techno scene in Manchester, but those two EPs presented a vision of dance music that had undergone a massive perspectival shift. Hyper-focused on sound design, Stott suddenly sounded like he'd been zeroing in on half-bars of his earlier club tracks and stretching their pulse and frequencies as far across the dance floor as he could. This was music on the brink, a sound that risked collapse. The monochromatic album covers, a mainstay for Stott ever since, also made clear to the audience that Stott was now a sound sculptor. His sense of groove still firmly intact, Stott was nevertheless more interested in introducing and shaping a musical form across a track then going through the dancefloor motions.     Never the Right Time  is excitingly different, if inconsistent. The well-known pillars of Stott's sound still underpin much of what happens across the album's nine tracks, yet the way those pillars are occasionally arranged have made way for new kinds of space. The grimy bass lines, forlorn vocals, skittering drum machines and smokestack ambience of albums past are all still there, but Stott has renegotiated their relationships. The album's most evocative moments sound like the jam-space recordings of a post-punk or dream pop band that had stolen away with Stott's synth patches.    Grooves are looser, melodies wander tentatively before settling, and vocal phrases omit words until there is finally some comfortable sonic footing on which to rest. The pick scrapes and bass notes that open the album would be equally fitting coming from a live band taking hold of their instruments and sound-checking momentarily before launching into their set. Standout track ""The beginning"" has a swagger to it not often possible in electronic music, irrespective of whether it was made on software or hardware.    Stott has hinted at this direction before. 2014's  Faith in Strangers  introduced rock-like applications of the bass guitar into the mix, and 2016's  Too Many Voices  significantly dialled down the haze of earlier albums for a more spacious and pop-oriented approach. Indeed,  Never the Right Time  suffers from sounding a bit too much like its predecessor. ""Never the right time"" and ""Answers"" would not be out of place on  Too Many Voices  and are by far the album's least compelling cuts. Nevertheless, Stott has once again found new ways to squeeze more surprises out of his palette, and hopefully not the last in a long line of permutations.

2021-04-16,Luke Fox,7,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Conway the Machine Sticks to His Signature Cadence on 'La Maquina',,"One of the most important — yet least discussed — tools in a rapper's arsenal is beat selection. A decent wordsmith can elevate himself to greatness with a keen ear. Conversely, a superior emcee can stagnate his own success by rhyming over ill-suited instrumentals.      Conway the Machine  prides himself as a workingman's lyricist, the member of the über-prolific three-headed monster known as Griselda who's deadliest with the darts. As Conway spits here, on the anthemic ""6:30 Tip Off"": ""They say Wes is the brains behind it, and Benny is the star / But let's not act like Machine ain't the silliest with the bars.""     Keeping in line with that tact, of wanting the listener's emphasis placed on his sticky punchlines, Conway has become an expert at curating grimy beats — and beatmakers — that bang hard but leave plenty of space to let his signature drawl, which comes in part from his Bell's palsy, dominate. ""I ain't sparin' no feelings when my pen is movin'/ I been in shootin's and sent men to intensive units,"" he blurts on ""Clarity.""     The hustle-first mentality that Conway and co. hardened on the streets of Buffalo has informed Griselda's full-throttle attack on the record release schedule. Invigorated since signing with Eminem's Shady Records, Conway keeps appetites whet for his major-label splash with  La Maquina , his fifth solo project in a relentless 13-month span. Unlike recent one-producer projects with  the Alchemist  (2020's  LULU ) and February's  If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed  with Big Ghost Ltd.,  La Maquina  sees Conway leaning on his expanded network of boardsmen.     Familiar talents like Bangladesh, Don Cannon,  Murda Beatz  and go-to Griselda sound designer Daringer all contribute. And the stylistic variance in sounds — from Alchemist's lazy-hazy ""200 Pies"" to Cosmo Beats' upbeat, horn-punched ""Grace"" — gives fresh texture to Conway's couplets, which seldom steers from guns, girls and greatness. Oh, and sports references. Lots of sports references.     It's the lesser-known J.R. Swift who produces two of the most addictive tracks on the record: sparse, head-nodding opener ""Bruiser Brody,"" and the superb ""Sister Abigail,"" a posse cut featuring Conway's Drumwork signees Jae Skeese and 7xvethegenius. Both are Buffalo talents with promising futures.     Conn's Day Ones,  Benny the Butcher  and  Westside Gunn , shine on the LP's guitar-licked finale, ""S.E. Gang,"" and our host makes it clear that just because he's branching off with his own imprint doesn't mean there's any ill will inside the family. ""I started Drumwork, people think it's beef with my brother / Maybe every endeavour we supposed to eat with each other,"" Conway raps on ""Bruiser Brody."" ""Fuck what they think and fuck they options / We jumpin' in Benzes.""     For the most part, Conway sticks to his signature cadence throughout this tight, 40-minute rip. So, those rare excursions where he stretches outside his vocal comfort range are much welcome. On ""KD,"" Conway flips his take on Cardi B's ""Bodak Yellow"" flow from 2017 and has a blast doing so. More challenging is his flirt with speed rap on the compelling cameo combo ""Scatter Brain"" with  J.I.D  and  Ludacris . Conway, batting leadoff, may be the least nimble of the trio, while J.I.D.'s effortlessness wins the day. But it's creative pushes like this we're hoping to hear more of when Conway's official Shady splash,  God Don't Make Mistakes , finally arrives.     We already know he'll choose dope beats.

2021-04-16,A. Harmony,6,"ALBUM,EP,REVIEWS,R&B,MUSIC","Justin Nozuka Picks Sincerity over Variety on 'then, now & again'",,"On his first collection of songs since 2018's  Run to Waters ,  Justin Nozuka  tries to channel his musical beginnings. He cites '70s singer-songwriters, '90s hip-hop and '00s R&B as the music that ignited his own artistic passion and while  then, now & again  doesn't immediately bring those eras to mind, they do provide a strong foundation for a sound that is all Nozuka's own.    Mellow and compact, the EP is even-keeled from start to finish — therein lies the project's most obvious flaw. While there is certainly beauty in simplicity, this succession of ballads drifts from one to another with nearly imperceptible differences. Luckily, the pocket Nozuka chooses to stay in is a pleasant one: each song is calming and refreshingly delicate — a break from the dark, often acerbic brand of alt-R&B his peers are delivering these days. But with little to sonically distinguish one song from the next, something about  then, now & again  feels incomplete.     What the project lacks in variety though, it makes up for in sincerity and candour. The EP's uncomplicated backdrop allows Nozuka's voice to shine and his heartfelt delivery injects a certain warmth into even the coldest story. ""Miami"" draws on Nozuka's experience with being ghosted — he planned a romantic meet up under the palm trees only to be stood up by his date. He channels the pain from that situation into a haunting vocal performance that makes the heart swell. Nozuka explores the highs of love as well: ""Rains It Pours"" is a tender and soulful counter to ""Miami""'s sadness; it's an ode to the honeymoon phase of a relationship and is perfect for cuddling. Nozuka infuses a touch of hip-hop influence on the steamy ""summer night o8""; the rhythm of his delivery on this song has a certain pulse. And on ""No One but You"", Nozuka finds the perfect complement in British singer-songwriter Mahalia.    While it's not the most dynamic effort, do not mistake  then, now & again  for a throwaway. Sonically it plays a little too safe, but the vulnerability and relatability Nozuka delivers throughout offers something worthwhile to hold on to.

2021-04-19,Heather Taylor-Singh,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Charlotte Cardin Breaks Free from Her Past on 'Phoenix',,"Charlotte Cardin  wants to be set free. On the titular, opening track to the Montreal singer-songwriter's debut album,  Phoenix , you can practically feel her desire to be liberated, grappling with two versions of herself, which are physically present on the album's cover. Cardin sings about  the hell she's been through  and wanting to be reborn, like the mythological bird the album is named after: ""I had to burn everything that I want just to come back like a phoenix.""      Phoenix  feels like an album for the modern young woman. At 26, Cardin effortlessly captures the complicated nature of trying to understand who she is and what she wants. She finds herself in a vulnerable state, but lyrically, her feelings are twisted into empowering vignettes. Tracks like ""Meaningless,"" about the fear of wasting time in your twenties, sounds like a cry for help, and ""Sex to Me,"" a track about a friend-with-benefits relationship gone stale is sung with a pinch of cheekiness. She's confidently able to confront her emotions with no remorse.    Cardin is good at the buildup, quietly singing about her insecurities and how past lovers have done her wrong, as the instrumentals slowly simmer. But when the beat drops, you can't help but nod your head and dance to oscillating synth beats as the passion in Cardin's voice intensifies, like on ""Passive Aggressive."" With thoughtfully constructed instrumentals, her voice is powerful.    The album features soulful ballads and dizzy pop-soul tracks that capture the range of Cardin's feelings during the conception of the album. Sonically, it works, and the versatility in emotion is refreshing as  Phoenix  progresses. The duality is furthered on the intensely exposing ""Good Girl"" and the sultry yet moody ""Sad Girl"" — a one-two punch of standouts. On the former, Cardin sings about begging a lover not to leave even though they're not necessarily right for her, while the latter is the aftermath. Cardin is unsure how to move on, deciding to channel her energy into songwriting, as she shares her inspiration when making the record, singing, ""I got an album from this fucking mess.""    While Cardin's vulnerability is heavily present throughout  Phoenix , she saves some of the most tender tracks for the second half of the album. ""Sun Goes Down (Buddy)"" is a hidden gem and feels like a hug in the midst of the bitterness and brooding angst surrounding it. Against a plucked acoustic guitar, Cardin's vocals are incredibly raw, and it's one of the album's more earnest moments. In a similar tone, the closing track, French-language ballad ""Je Quitte,"" is quite sombre, but it's clear Cardin is far from giving up — she's just getting started.      On  Phoenix , Cardin finds her truth and is finally able to break out of her shell. The album is filled with love and heartbreak, but it's also infused with freedom and growth. Cardin sheds the skin of her past self and resiliently moves forward into the unknown to find herself.

Helado  is a well-produced trap record with melodic sensibility, as much about partying, cars and lust as it is a snapshot of a teenager navigating an era of rolling lockdowns.     Riding high off the Soundcloud successes of 2019's ""I.T.B."" and  Helado  lead single ""Mango,"" the New Brunswick rapper's latest album is a record made for anyone who rolled joints on their high school math textbooks Friday night, and brushed the kief off Monday morning.  Helado  captures the hedonism and invincibility unique to adolescence, but with some childhood artifacts left in the mix. On ""Matter of Time,"" Helado raps that he hopes he never dies and that he's driving with his eyes closed while also sliding in a reference to sour keys into the song's chorus: ""if you find a key, watch the sweetness turn to sour."" The vicarious thrill from teenage recklessness makes the album exciting, although at times, Helado's energy distracts from its subtle moments of sincerity.      Though sex is a recurring subject of the record, it's clear the pandemic has gotten in the way of Helado's love life. Referencing a hook up on ""Tone it Down,"" he sings, ""but I'm quarantined so don't touch me."" Physical distancing has come with some added angst for Helado, but he's being cautious. Not following COVID guidelines is clearly a dealbreaker.     Helado 's production quality belies its high-school bedroom origins. The beats are emotionally tuned and lay a solid base for Helado's smooth vocals and crooning harmonies, as on the track ""Lavish,"" where each bar hits with youthful vigor. The AutoTune is tasteful and used for its musicality, not as a concealer — he doesn't need it to be. Melodic and melancholic with a healthy amount of confidence, Helado has created an environment that fits well both at the peak of the party and the reflective stumble home.

2021-04-01,Kaelen Bell,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Dry Cleaning Spit Back the Unending Noise of the World on 'New Long Leg',,"Florence Shaw writes a song like a bowerbird builds a nest, with an obsessive fixation for colourful garbage. On  Dry Cleaning 's debut full-length,  New Long Leg , Shaw weaves new language from journal pages and YouTube comments, advertisements, headlines, haircuts and spoiled food, turning ordinary detritus into something fantastical and useful. Bolstered by lush production from John Parish, Tom Dowse's riffs take on a new depth and Lewis Maynard and Nick Buxton's kinetic rhythms are accented with shakers, drum machines and handclaps.  New Long Leg  is a bristling and steely-eyed statement of intent, introducing Shaw as an anthropologist of the everyday, or, as she deadpans on the sinewy ""Strong Feelings"": ""Just an emo dead stuff collector / Things come to the brain.""    Shaw's rock star origin story — a visual artist suddenly finds herself fronting a post-punk band — bears more than a passing resemblance to that of Sue Tompkins, the joyous propeller of the legendary Life Without Buildings. But where Tompkins found possibility in syllables and sounds, Shaw finds it in the space between them; her deadpan delivery, so mathematically precise and unconcerned with keeping time, drags and disrupts where Tompkins' twirled and danced. Onstage, Shaw is still, eyes fixed on the middle distance, nearly deleting herself in service of what she's releasing; ""I'm just a conduit / Don't look at me / I'm just the medium,"" she says on the psychedelic ""Every Day Carry.""    This disappearing act happens several times on  New Long Leg , as though Shaw is attempting to get out of the way of her own words. Over the title track's brushed-iron guitar, she breaks her barrage of questions about cruise amenities to ask, ""Are there some kind of reverse platform shoes that make you go into the ground more / Make you reach a lower level?"" But before waiting for a reply, she turns away — ""Nevermind.""    Most songs on  New Long Leg  work this way — specific lines come careening like meteors from the cluttered sky, sudden moments of clarity that realign the apparent randomness. It's hard to care about the narrative of a song like ""Scratchcard Lanyard"" when it offers something as spectacular as ""I think of myself as a hardy banana / With that waxy surface and the small delicate flowers / A woman in aviators firing a bazooka,"" but deeper meaning reveals itself in time: ""I've come here to make a ceramic shoe / And I've come to smash what you made / I've come to learn how to mingle / I've come to learn how to dance / I've come to join the knitting circle."" A challenge of expectation, of ageing and caregiving and women's roles and failures to conform; there's rage running under ""Scratchcard Lanyard,"" a deep frustration belied by Shaw's ever-cool delivery.    Despite all the common magic and curiosity in the writing,  New Long Leg  is an even-keeled record, and the quartet remain at a confident simmer for the length of its 40 minutes. The considered pace of Shaw's delivery is an invitation to explore her mind on her exacting terms, something she nods to on ""John Wick"": ""They've really changed the pace of the  Antiques Roadshow  / More antiques, more price reveals / Less background information,"" she says while the band crash in waves around her. ""The reason the price reveals were so good / Was because we had to wait for them.""  New Long Leg  is a record that values patience and deliberateness, one that stews and worries and rages but never lets its veneer slip — a soundtrack for holding it together.    Towering centrepiece ""Her Hippo"" is the beating heart of the record; a romantic escape blooming beneath Dowse's slate-grey riffs, a story so vulnerable and hopeful it hurts to look at directly. ""Safe inside a secret love / Let's run,"" Shaw says, before deflating the tension and turning to the absurd: ""Anyway, mystical Shakespeare shoes / A trapped person screaming / The last thing I looked at in this hand mirror was a human arsehole."" Eventually, the small offerings of sincerity become more potent for their scarcity, and a couplet as curt and half-committal as ""I'd like to run away with you on a plane / But don't bring those loafers"" feels like it's squeezing your heart. Even after all the avoidance and rug-pulling, there's the feeling that ""Her Hippo"" is getting at something too raw and embarrassing to confront head-on — that among all the pointless rubbish, love remains: ""Feel like I wanna send you 20 texts / Let me know when you're inside the plane.""    Following a fourth-wall breaching breakdown on seven-minute closer ""Every Day Carry,"" Shaw mutters what might be  New Long Leg 's bluntest admission: ""I just want to put something positive into the world / But it's hard because I'm so full of poisonous rage.""  New Long Leg  may not always be positive, but it's more interesting than that, more needling and necessary. It's everything at once, a record that absorbs and spits back the unending noise of the world and asks that you take a second look, every common thing somehow made brand new.

2021-04-01,Matt Bobkin,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Godspeed You! Black Emperor Revisit Past Glories on 'G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END!',,"Godspeed You! Black Emperor  have always been ahead of the times. The Montreal post-rock legends pushed the boundaries of the then-nascent genre with their earliest releases, and used their liner notes as overtly political missives two decades ago. When they were  awarded the Polaris Music Prize in 2013  for their comeback record,  Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend! , they  criticized the pomp and circumstance of the gala , and donated the $50,000 prize to charitable organizations dedicated to giving musical instruments to prison inmates in Quebec.    The band's longstanding push for prison and police reform, and an urgent need for unity, have since become popular positions among a growing chorus of believers in the existence of a better world. Godspeed have used their music and platform as a means to campaign for their beliefs — ideas that, both with and without their influence, have amassed far more traction in recent years.    At a time when the band's political subtext is more broadly resonant than ever, they're curiously looking backward, in many ways, on their latest album,  G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END!  Where each album has toyed with unique structures and composition, like the side-long suites of early works,  Allelujah ! 's alternating between 12"" and 7"" discs, or  Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress ' single, 40-minute-long composition,  G_d's Pee  is — in an atypical move — an amalgam of previous ideas, oscillating between two lengthy-titled, multi-movement suites and two shorter, more ambient pieces. Whether they're done with such rampant innovation or merely taking a respite (and could you blame them?), their latest album features an all-star cast of stylistic choices from their past 25 years of releases: found-sound fragments absent on their last two releases; stark, twin-image artwork that recalls that of their 2000 sophomore album,  Lift Your S kinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven ; the placement of their longtime, fan-favourite ""God's Pee"" nickname front and centre in the album's title. When many have been forced to look inward, they've gone against type and joined the crowd.    Godspeed's best work has always been more about structure than sound, and returning to previous formats has yielded similar results. As always, the band are at the height of their powers when at their most emotively rousing. There are certainly plenty of those moments on  G_d's Pee , like the swaying soundscapes of ""First of the Last Glaciers,"" the oceanic wail of ""Cliffs Gaze,"" the rousing climax of ""ASHES TO SEA or NEARER TO THEE"" and the elegiac strings that send off album closer ""OUR SIDE HAS TO WIN (for D.H)."" Melody has always been the band's strongest suit, and they deliver plenty here, whether channelling ominous horror or fist-raising triumph. But when recalling their previous efforts, there's an unshakeable feeling that they've done it before, but better — though you can't fault them for doing what so many post-rockers have done over the past 20 years.    With their chosen modes of expression and communication, exaggerated affect has become Godspeed's calling card, and one of their most successful traits. On  G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END , many of the extra flourishes are pushed into the background, like the ham radio sound collages that open the two longer tracks. The menacing drawls of ""'GOVERNMENT CAME' (9980.0kHz 3617.1kHz 4521.0 kHz)"" are gone before the insurrectionist messaging can be fully reckoned with, losing the power of its forebears in ""Murray Ostril: '...They Don't Sleep Anymore on the Beach...'"" from  Skinny Fists  or even the similarly backgrounded found-sound chorus of ""With his arms outstretched"" that kicks off  Allelujah .    Contrary to many email greetings from the past year, these aren't ""unprecedented times,"" a fact of which Godspeed are well-aware. That's why they're business as usual on  G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END! , even if that's a mode they've typically before gone out of their way to avoid.

2021-04-05,Luke Pearson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC",CFCF Pays Homage to the Heady Years of Y2K on 'Memoryland',,"Here is another quality electronic release setting out to explore a specific musical era. Last month, British producer Danny L. Harle mined '90s rave styles to excellent effect on his debut LP,  Harlecore , and now, Canadian producer  CFCF  (Mike Silver) has delivered  Memoryland , a fun and highly evocative trip through the heady years of Y2K. With periodizing conceits like this, there's always a risk that the results will end up coming across as mere exercise, a clinical deployment of knowing techniques rather than an authentic sublimation of one's influences (a romanticized perception one still strays from at their own peril). Here, however, Silver manages to walk the line here, turning out a varied and clever album — even if he indulges in some startlingly on-the-nose homage from time to time.      Indeed, how you feel about artists being guided not just by broad stylistic influences but by specific tracks from specific albums will likely guide your own opinions here, as some of the more celebratory moments on  Memoryland  get very close to outright imitation. It's hard to find fault when the results are good (which these are), but it's definitely an example of a risk that paid off. ""Model Castings"" borrows the programming and production style of Aphex Twin's ""Windowlicker"" down to some fairly specific details, for instance, and ""After the After"" is taken straight from the Squarepusher playbook — specifically ""My Red Hot Car"" from Go Plastic. Perhaps most bittersweet is the very particular-sounding solo in disco-funk workout ""Self Serve 1999,"" an obvious ode to Daft Punk's glorious ""Digital Love."" Silver is certainly no slouch, but the gulf between inspiration and result is never more apparent than here; too soon, Mike.    While these heavy debts don't exactly sink the proceedings,  Memoryland  is arguably at its strongest when its homages and nods are less vigorous. The brief but surprisingly evocative ""Suburbilude"" is a fine example: its buzzing guitar chords shimmer out of the void like some kind of lost transmission from the past, an errant file in your Limewire queue, and it does more to encapsulate the album's nostalgic mood than any of the more calculated moments; sometimes the spirit translates better than the letter.     This isn't the only track with guitars either —  Memoryland  is as equally informed by seminal alternative acts like Sonic Youth and Smashing Pumpkins as it is by electronica heroes like Underworld or Daft Punk; it cuts a rich swath, and while it may ultimately have more appeal if the Pumpkins' ""1979"" was your 1995, anyone looking for a well-organized trip into the dial-up times of yore will find much to enjoy on  Memoryland .

Heralding the impending arrival of summer, the album is reflective of his upbringing in Toronto and influenced by his current life in Montreal. He offers an amalgam of sounds that often intertwine well with his storytelling.    Milla Thyme, also known as Maxwell Miller, has been a player in the Montreal scene for a while now, including with the Urban Science Brass Band and collaborating with improv collective Kalmunity.  Everything Has Its Time  shows off his skills and creativity with soulful hip-hop that has a special Montreal flair to it. His music is shaped by the places he visited and the people he's met. Opening with ""W.O.M.E.N.,"" a tale of modern dating, the song invites us to slow down and listen to his lyrical prowess. Through every song, the rapper delivers a specific vibe, with some strong Anderson .Paak and Mac Miller influence in the mix. On ""3 Dimensions,"" Milla Thyme revisits his life in Toronto through a soulful beat. In standout ""Straight to You,"" he sings about his experience through the Montréal music scene, brought to life with a slow-burning intensity.    Thyme also struggles to find a cohesive identity on the album. Understandably, he wants to explore every genre and style possible. On ""Borders,"" the production lacks direction, and his mellow voice is lost under multiple arrangements. ""Heaven Looks Like,"" a gospel-heavy track, doesn't find its place on the album and is eclipsed by much stronger tracks. The lack of direction makes it difficult to make sense of where Thyme wants to go.    Nevertheless, Thyme impresses on his debut LP, and he'll have listeners craving more of his soulful voice and funk vibe. Now is his time to take his place in the blooming Montreal rap and R&B scenes.

2021-04-06,Chris Gee,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Spirit of the Beehive's 'ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH' Captures the Beautiful Chaos of the Human Mind",,"The words ""entertainment"" and ""death"" one after another seem like a commentary on society — as if to say our current social media-driven world is entirely built upon quick-consuming content until we're burnt out or die. While only loosely based around this concept,  Spirit of the Beehive 's new album sounds like it is speeding up this process.    To put it succinctly, the band's fourth album  ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH  is a mood, or really all of the moods — a scattered inclination to experience the simultaneous hysteria and serenity of the chaotic nature of our unfiltered minds. The Philadelphia-based three-piece, led by Zack Schwartz and Rivka Ravede, do not try to tame their inner thoughts but rather harness them to blossom into something manically weird and totally wondrous.    Following the departure of two of their members during the pandemic, Spirit of the Beehive take one big step away from the traditional band set-up of guitar, bass and drums that they started out with on their self-titled debut in favour of a multi-instrumentalist approach drawing from elements of shoegaze, psych-folk, screamo and experimental electronic music. Songs like ""THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO"" contain all of the above, starting out with a hypnotic, murky riff and Rivka Ravede's blissed out vocals that slowly mutate into abrasive guitar screeches and Zach Schwartz's freaky screams, tied together with a thumping programmed beat and creepy voice sample that repeats the song's title. On their prior album, 2017's  Hypnic Jerks , the inclusion of field recordings gave the album a mystical, all-encompassing aura, but on  ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH , the samples resemble snippets of a nightmare that are cleverly weaved into the sporadic melodies of the songs.    Spirit of the Beehive texturally piece together nonsensical emotions, a jumbled and miraculous mess exactly as they are remembered or felt in our heads. Album opener ""ENTERTAINMENT"" starts out with noisy electronics only to be temporarily smoothed out by the Schwartz's vaporous vocals, like snapping out of an incoherent trip. The shifts in temperament on the album are complex within any given song, as the band sort through a plethora of ideas in whatever ways feel natural. The penultimate seven-minute track ""I SUCK THE DEVIL'S COCK,"" for example, is a hallucinatory four-part journey of disjointed sketches that bleed into each other, profusely but with purpose.    Many other moments on  ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH  are just as cryptically absurd and endlessly fascinating. A common thread of the record is tied up in a feverish daydream, revealing the band's loose interpretations of a possible fault in the simulation. Each listen to the album reveals another asymmetrical layer that adds to its seductive arrangements. The fizzy, slowcore guitars on ""GIVE UP YOUR LIFE"" are pitch-warped askew while Schwartz's bare, emo-inflicted voice is clear (rather than passed through myriad effects, like usual). There are lurking, subconscious voices nudging, ""No limitations, you know what I'm after,"" as on ""RAPID & COMPLETE RECOVERY,"" prodded by a sunny, lightly strummed guitars and Ravede's slinking, groovy bassline. Little catchy earworms come and go in an instant — was it Ravede's entrancing dream pop verse in the first half of ""WRONG CIRCLE"" that is stuck in your head? Or was it her hazily climbing bass and gloomy backing vocal in ""THE SERVER IS IMMERSED""?    Spirit of the Beehive's unsettling compositions are not for casual listening. On  ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH , every fragmented idea is thoughtfully ripped apart and stitched back together with the gusto of a delirious genius. The band reframes reality and mixes the euphoric highs with the sinking lows in strangely surreal collages that are freakishly beautiful, leaving you feeling kinda stoned and a little bit sinful.

2021-04-06,Leslie Ken Chu,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC,POP AND ROCK",Sook-Yin Lee and Adam Litovitz Radiate Warmth and Healing on 'jooj two',,"Since the mid-'90s,  Sook-Yin Lee  has embedded herself in Canadian culture through her work as a broadcaster, actor, filmmaker, musician, and performance artist. In 2015, she embarked on a new musical journey with poet and composer Adam Litovitz. Calling themselves  Jooj , they released a  self-titled album  of tense torch songs as serene as they were unnerving. At the time, Lee and Litovitz were partners in love. Though they later separated after 12 years together, they remained a central part of each other's lives until Litovitz  tragically died in June 2019 .    Before Litovitz's tragic passing, he and Lee had begun laying down tracks for what would become their followup,  jooj two . But with Litovitz busy soundtracking a Netflix series, the duo decided she should finish the album without him. Nearly two years after Litovitz died, Lee is finally ready share that album. This time, however, there are no façades or alter egos: she is releasing the album under their own names.     jooj two  spawned from  Lee and Litovitz 's desire to pay homage to their mutual love of pop music. But time and circumstance have exalted the album with a greater purpose: to celebrate Litovitz's life and all the affection he and Lee shared together — as friends, creative collaborators and lovers.  jooj two  encapsulates life in all its dizzying joy, comfort, confusion, doubt and despair. The album is a much-needed companion as the world grieves during the pandemic life. It is a source of empathy and hope for those feeling uncertain and alone.    Lee and Litovitz created  Jooj  at their own pace in the comfort of their home studio. She often spoke of that process as tending to a garden. Their leisurely stewardship continues on  jooj two , and the yield is lusher and livelier.    Considering Lee and Litovitz's multiple talents, the mental fog of grief, and the theme of growth, it makes sense that Lee conjures Apollo on  jooj two . In Greek and Roman mythology, Apollo is the god of music, dance, poetry, healing, order, agriculture and the sun. Through heavily abstracted lyrics, Lee calls his name on ""Run Away with Her"" (""Late Apollo, lack a loyal biding time / Made up aural light amoral lens"") and  ""Re-Veil""  (""She will break him down / On a creek I'm gone / All the parts are tight / Take care, Apollo"").    Litovitz's playful, curious spirit lives on in  jooj two 's experimentalism. Thick, gritty electronics rule the queasily seductive grind of ""Narcolept, Falling."" The humid electronica of ""Ship It Out"" rises to a feverish dub drill. On ""Lake Girls,"" Lee's multilayered vocals over plucked guitar notes and springy, cuckoo-like percussion create a cartoonish realm in the most wide-eyed and wondrous way. ""There is time for sight to bend / Into a new ornament,"" she sings, suggesting that time will heal all wounds, or at least reduce the pain of losing her partner; the gift that was Lee and Litovitz's relationship will shine anew in hindsight.    The churning ""Wrecking Heart"" is another bright spot. As an immense drum thrums over a squeaky beat, Lee looks to the future: ""In a golden tomorrow / I'll find a new me / In the wait and the wonder."" No moments are more beautiful than ""Delicate Tracks"" or the etherial harmonies of ""Rumble Like a Stranger,"" though. By simply lowering her vocal register on ""Delicate Tracks,"" she hits an emotional depth not heard elsewhere on  jooj two .    But like any bountiful garden,  jooj two  contains dark crevices and shaded canopies. An uneasy beat skitters beneath chopped and screwed vocals on ""Introductory Escape."" ""Thorn in the Laws of Attraction"" pumps up the heart rate like an approaching stampede. ""Admitting that I'm wrong / Is a bigger load / Ignoring thank you / Riled up my heart,"" Lee sings on the roving ""Re-Veil,"" hinting at regret over loose ends and unfinished business.    Lee also seeks order to remedy her unmoored present existence. She finds a glimmer of it on ""Run Away with Her,"" a song inspired by the lonesome pandemic days she spent wandering Toronto's empty streets in search of her missing half. ""I don't want to hide / I see you there / You are all aligned."" ""Run Away with Her"" radiates warmth; it is inviting, a sanctuary.    The closest Lee comes to closure is on the epilogue, a sendoff simply titled ""Adam."" Over sparing gamelan, she chants a protection mantra from ancient Tibetan Buddhism. ""Om tare tuttare ture soha,"" she repeats, ""I prostrate to the Liberator, mother of the victorious ones."" She prays for salvation from suffering as a means to true freedom, as much for herself as for Litovitz. The piece ends with the gentle sounds of lapping of water, a fundamental element of creation and a healing, nourishing force.  jooj two  flows in loving memory of Adam Litovitz.

2021-04-07,Tom Piekarski,8,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",claire rousay Puts Her Ambient Experimentation in 'a softer focus',,"On  a softer focus ,  claire rousay  has delivered both her most accessible and compositionally daring album to date. Past releases have often relied on some combination of field recordings culled from daily routine, audio snippets of candid conversations among friends and the suggestive percussion of everyday objects gently colliding. That version of rousay's work may feel unrewarding to those who prefer more concrete melodic or rhythmic signposts in their music. For listeners who find rousay's brand of experimental music opaque, this new collection of songs may be the introduction they need.     a softer focus  boasts more traditional compositional markers in the form of cello, violin and vocal performances across five of the album's six tracks. The string sections are beautifully executed in their own right, but they are especially powerful as accompaniments to rousay's more typical found sounds.    For those who have already bought into what rousay does,  a softer focus  feels like the rush of hearing your favourite soloist carving out their voice among other musical collaborators. The bass tones introduced towards the end of ""Diluted Dreams"" perfectly amplify the intensity of Macie Stewart's violin playing. There are some notable additions to rousay's toolkit, too. Besides the occasional appearance of MIDI keys throughout a softer focus, rousay's voice makes a couple of impactful appearances.    One of the album's most powerful moments comes during standout track ""Stoned Gesture,"" when the bleeps of some doubtless quotidian machine give way to the lush billows of rousay's Auto-Tuned vocals and Alex Cunningham's violin. From a songwriting perspective, these tricks are not brand new, but they provide an acute sense of comfort and so elegantly buoy a style that is already very intimate.     That intimacy is also present in the visual presentation of the album, which merits its own praise. rousay worked closely with friend and visual artist Dani Toral throughout the creative process for a softer focus, a fact which adds dimension to an artistic practice that is already so predicated on friendship. The album packaging, video for ""Peak Chroma,"" and accompanying longsleeve and custom-made ceramic whistles all exude the same warmth that the music does. With Toral's help, rousay has presented a musical vision that is newly inviting while retaining all of the elements that have made her music so special.

2021-04-07,Chris Bryson,8,"PUNK,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Winnipeg's Tunic Purge Dark Emotions on Career-Spanning 'Exhaling',,"Tunic 's music is all about complex and chaotic catharsis. Since releasing their debut 7-inch in 2016, and when they still could, the Winnipeg trio toured the world, brandishing their auditory blast furnace for anyone willing to take the heat. With their new album,  Exhaling , the band has compiled their previously sold-out discography with three new songs, putting together one of the year's most ferocious collections of noisy and raucous art punk.    While most of the 23 tracks on this album run through frantic patterns of pummeling drums, burly bass and ragged and razor-edged guitar, Tunic showcase their strengths with how they skew their song structures by twisting these elements in and out of volatile shapes, like crushing doom on ""Radius,"" odd rhythms on ""Invalid"" and ""Dry Heave"" and squealing, whirling guitar on ""Boss,"" ""Shaking Hands"" and the title track. ""Nothing Nothing"" also features guitar that swarms like savage bees, while the otherworldly shrieking at the end of ""Frontal Lobe"" recalls the Body's Chip King's lacerated howl.    Any melody is jagged or angsty, like on ""Mumbled,"" ""Empty Handed"" and ""Fade Out."" The band's guitarist and vocalist David Schellenberg sometimes uses his instrument to create dissonant and angular sounds that give tracks like ""Nylon,"" ""Envious"" and ""Eye Contact"" an atonal no wave edge. The album's songs are propelled by the band's demolishing rhythm section, with Rory Ellis' rugged bass and drummer Dan Unger, a relentless force behind the kit, providing the unstable ground on which Tunic blast full steam ahead.    For newcomers to the band's music (or anyone approaching it without a lyrics sheet), it might take several listens to figure out what Schellenberg is so angry about. But Tunic is more about visceral rhythm, noise and emotion, with Schellenberg as the raging head to the band's gnarled beast. This isn't to say there's no purpose behind all the venom spitting. Throughout the album (and the band's career), Schellenberg has used Tunic as a coping mechanism to explore and expel dark and toxic themes and emotions, and you can hear it in every incisive bark. ""Disappointment"" is about feeling like being just that, where ""Dry Heave"" is flush with anxiety, and ""Envious"" digs into self-worth. And while there's a cryptic nature to some of the lyrics, there's also a passionate depth behind their intent.     This collection of the band's catalog feels like a brutal staging ground for whatever comes next. For listeners who prefer extremes for emotional release,  Exhaling  is an album that will give you room to breathe.

2021-04-08,Adam Feibel,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",PONY Make Millennial Malaise Sound Fun on 'TV Baby',,"After five years of well-received live gigs and two solid EPs, the debut full-length album by Toronto-based group  PONY  has everything there is to like about the band — and lots more of it. Led by singer Sam Bielanski, they pump out sharp, flashy power-pop gems with a grunge spirit, bringing to mind '90s mementos like Letters to Cleo and the Breeders as well as present-day revivalists like Diet Cig, Ratboys and Charly Bliss.    The absolute simplest way to describe  TV Baby  is that it's made by millennials for millennials. It's entirely possible that the album was written during a marathon of  Dawson's Creek  and  Breaker High  and recorded directly to Hubba Bubba tape. But while PONY's upbeat, overdriven music does indeed sound ready-made for YTV promos, Capri Sun commercials or a  Clueless  reboot, the album's themes of wasted youth, social awkwardness and arrested development ought to resonate with anyone from preteens to 30-somethings — really, anyone who feels like they need to both grow up and have more fun, but doesn't know how to do both.    PONY waste no time getting to the hooks, and there's no sense in doing so. The punchy, off-beat accents of ""Chokecherry"" quickly give way to a hard-hitting chorus with a generous helping of generationally cherished slang: ""Ooh, you blew it / If you don't know me by now I'm so over it / Can you get a grip? / You talk and you talk but you don't listen,"" Bielanski sings in a sugary sweet yet appropriately smart-alecky tone. These songs commit to the Ramonescore approach of high-voltage power chords and catchy melodies, with a resulting sound that has roughly the flavour and texture of a Fuzzy Peach candy.    An outlet for the anxiety of Google-induced hypochondria, ""WebMD"" is an excellent, high-energy tune with a first-rate chorus melody. On ""Couch,"" Bielanski sings about not living up to people's expectations over bright chords and an unrelenting pop-punk beat. ""I tried my best to be great, but it didn't take too kindly,"" they add in ""Furniture,"" surrounded by plunking bass, steady drums and squalls of guitar. ""I feel so alive when no one is around,"" they admit later in ""My Room,"" their voice taking flight in a bright, open-air chorus that sounds fittingly free and uninhibited. The three-song run of midtempo tunes ""Sometime Later,"" ""Cry"" and ""Sunny D"" all hum along at more or less the same space, making the album's back half drag a bit. But the band manages to stick the landing with ""Swore,"" a closing track that's bittersweet and refreshingly spacious.     TV Baby  tends to wallow in millennial malaise, but PONY have a lot of fun with it. It's the kind of record that's made for good times but speaks most directly to the experience of watching the world go by on television and Instagram. That's sort of the dichotomy of today's young adult. Sure, it might feel like you're stuck on an airplane that's slowly heading toward a crash-landing, but at least the in-flight entertainment is good.

VIISIONS ' 10 songs coast through synth-pop, psychedelia, R&B and vaporwave on the road to big existential wonderings.    Werbicki bends every element at his disposal — burbling waves of synth, psych-warped guitars, lively drumming, his own chill-dude delivery, all of the aforementioned genres — into a unified, singular vision. That the album feels so fully realized is a credit to his sense of specificity (he also produced the record).  VIISIONS  is a skillfully immersive debut, drawing up a sonic landscape that feels right for traversing galaxy-brain questions without losing pop hooks along the way. The album is equally concerned with the vibe of the party as it is with the frequency of the soul.    The album's opening instrumental title track sets a tone of wavering synths and warm-up drums, before ""Enamored"" gives them a propulsive urgency. Album highlight ""me Roll"" takes its synths for a joyride, unhurried and confident as they stunt across its runtime, while ""Jesus Age"" and ""Common Sensei"" lean on guitars to frame their musings of aging and bacchanalia.    Werbicki describes himself as a stream-of-consciousness writer, and lyrically, he's adept knowing the best stoner-profound lines to jot down, like ""I've stepped out of my consciousness a hundred times before / but this feeling now is one I can't ignore"" on ""Henlo Fren,"" Or, on the comedown vibes of closer ""Lifetimes,"" musing about our limited time on Earth before expressing a simpler concern: ""I don't wanna spend too much time on things that I don't care about.""    That follow-up is key: Werbicki is drawn to philosophical queries that elude easy answers, but he never neglects the human sentiments behind asking them in the first place.  VIISIONS  expresses its existential wonder through well-honed songcraft, which more than sells the sentiment.

2021-03-23,Ashley Hampson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Death from Above 1979 Have Settled into Their Lives and Sound on 'Is 4 Lovers',,"Since forming  Death from Above 1979  in 2001, Jesse F. Keeler and  Sebastien Grainger  have taken their melodic post-hardcore and dance-punk aesthetic and honed a sound recognizable as entirely their own. The band's evolution in all respects has had its share of obstructions. After their now-iconic first releases — 2002's EP  Heads Up  and their 2004 LP  You're a Woman, I'm a Machine  —  the duo split in 2006 , with creative and musical differences as partial reasoning. It's that early, teeth-kicking aggression that fans held onto  until DFA reunited in 2011 . The regret, angst, and loathing of the pair's earlier releases had tapered off — 2014's  The Physical World   and 2017's  Outrage! Is Now  presented a much more paced and routine rhythm.     Grainger and Keeler produced the entirety of  Is 4 Lovers  themselves, leading to creative freedom and plenty of space for reflection. The current political climate factors heavily into the album — tracks like ""Modern Guy"" and ""N.Y.C. Power Elite, Part 1"" are pretty straightforward in their messages. Single ""One + One,"" as proclaimed by Grainger, is a ""karmic sequel"" to  You're a Woman  track ""Romantic Rights,"" and is by all measures a love song. While the earlier track embodied a crass rendering of what could be, the new offering is a much more mature reflection of what is, which is the start of Grainger's family, showcasing how much they've grown since their early days.    Simplicity and aggression have their place on  Is 4 Lovers  alongside slight nods to Keeler's and Grainger's other bands and solo projects, sounds that subtly inch their way into the album's top layer — more a topical dusting not exactly absorbed into the work itself. ""Love Letter"" is a ballad, and the absence of any grit and inclusion of piano offers a softer side of the duo, while ""Glass Homes"" is a slower offering of double-time hi-hat and peaking synth that would fit right in on Grainger's 2013 solo album,  Yours to Discover .     On  Is 4 Lovers , the pair have settled in and settled down, both in their lives and to their own sound.

2021-03-23,Alex Hudson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MODERN COMPOSITION,SOUNDTRACKS,MUSIC",Arcade Fire and Owen Pallett's 'Her' Score Mixes Quiet Minimalism with Big Emotional Payoffs,,"Arcade Fire 's career has been devoted to maximalist anthems and epic, arena-sized grandeur, with only one notable exception: their Oscar-nominated score for  Her ,  Spike Jonze 's 2013 romcom that asks the question ""if you love your computer so much, then why don't you marry it?"" The music leaked online around the time of the film's release, but it's never been officially available until now.    Largely composed by  Will Butler  along with co-credited collaborator  Owen Pallett , the  Her  score trades out Arcade Fire's usual Springsteen worship for Satie soundalikes, its piano miniatures bearing almost no resemblance to anything the band have done before or since.    It's a breath of fresh air, showing that Arcade Fire are capable of packing an emotional punch even without all of the band members ""whoa""-ing in unison.  Her (Original Score)  is a whisper, not a shout.    This experiment in subtlety takes a few different forms. On ""Milk & Honey #1,"" it's stark chord swells that sound like a gnarly organ patch, or maybe even a cello run through a distorted guitar amp; in the back half of ""Morning Talk / Supersymmetry,"" it's borrowing some of the burbling arpeggiators from the closing track to the band's 2013 LP,  Reflektor ;  on ""Milk & Honey #2,"" it's ominous synth drones and sparse, lonely guitar plucking.    But for the most part,  Her  is full of delicate piano compositions: ""Song on the Beach"" is melancholically gorgeous, despite being a clear knockoff of Satie's ""Gymnopedie,"" while the cascading arpeggios and dramatic bass notes of ""Photograph"" are absolutely begging to be imported into iMovie for a compilation video of wedding photographs.  Her  is a futuristic movie about obsession with technology, but much of the score sounds less like science fiction and more like something from a Parisian salon in the late 1800s.    Even though Pallett is credited as an equal collaborator, the score is low on his signature strings. ""Some Other Place"" and ""We're All Leaving"" have some swelling orchestrations that bear some resemblance to a traditional Hollywood score, but they melt away quickly, only to be replaced more soft keys.    It's entirely not clear why  Her (Original Score)  hasn't been officially released until now, especially since it leaked almost immediately and has been available online for anyone who cared to look hard enough. (Perhaps Arcade Fire didn't want to flood the market, as the film came out just a couple months after  Reflektor .) Whatever the case, this official release restores an important Arcade Fire artifact: proof that they can craft an emotional payoff with minimalism rather than the usual pomp.

2021-03-24,Jack Kelleher,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",Sanguisugabogg Delve into the Seediest Depths of Death Metal on 'Tortured Whole',,"There has been a communal yearning among death metal bands of late for a return to the genre's seedy underbelly. Not satisfied with that,  Sanguisugabogg  delve down even further. The Columbus, OH-bred four-piece (and Maggot Stomp poster children) amassed an underground cult following with the release of their 2019 EP,  Pornographic Seizures , with old-school death metal devotees praising its commitment to crudeness.    For any fans of their EP laying awake at night in fear the band have somehow changed since signing to Century Media, let me assure you they haven't added a keyboard or clean vocals yet. The septic gutturals and down-tuned pummeling riffs of  Pornographic  are all at play on their debut,  Tortured Whole , and the band are as fervent as ever in their celebration of perversion.    Tortured Whole blurs the lines between different subgenres of death in its psychedelic haze. Like most old-school banner-wavers, it owes much to death/doom pioneers like Autopsy, particularly in its thundering bass and the foreboding intro to ""Urinary Ichor."" Morbid Angel is another prominent old-school influence on this record, which can be heard in the seismic syncopation of the title track and the outro to ""Felching Filth."" There's a late 1990s/early 2000s vibe to this album as well, with shades of Devourment found not only in vocalist Devin Swank's pig squeals, but also in the pseudo-slam riffs of ""Dragged by a Truck."" There's even greasy junkyard grooves reminiscent of Pig Destroyer in tracks like ""Gored in the Chest.''    It's like someone put their thumb on a spinning Mortician record when these influences come together on  Tortured Whole . From the first note, it's clear this record is going to be a knuckle-dragging caveman slug-fest. Opening track ""Menstrual Envy"" enters with the subtlety of a battering ram, dropping your IQ with a combo of pig squeals and chugging riffs in its opening salvo, pinch harmonics stabbing at you from the darkness like those interdimensional meathooks in  Hellraiser . If, at this point in the album you can still spell your name, don't worry — your evolutionary regression will accelerate when ""Dead as Shit"" rolls around. This lumbering behemoth struts with the swagger of steady, self-assured riffs, hockey checking mountains into other mountains when the bass and drums enter. Sanguisugabogg truly shine on""Urinary Ichor,"" which features whiplashing tempo shifts while hydroplaning between death/doom and brutal death metal.    It's also worth mentioning synth interlude ""Pornographic."" A beautifully haunting tune, it could easily have been ripped from the soundtrack of some long lost slasher film, which sells the sleazy and indulgent '80s horror aesthetic underpinning this album. It's a refreshing change from the usual bland ambient synth tracks death metal bands put out when they want to — oh wait, they were just saving that for the second interlude. Why does this album even have two interludes? This isn't a three act opera complete with intermissions, it's a sketchy flick in porno theatre; let's not waste time and just do what we came here to do.    This album has shortcomings besides just one too many generic interludes. While  Tortured Whole  does its pummeling grooves well, it sticks too close to the caveman thing. Most songs get by on that alone, but others feel more like a series of stitched together grooves that build up to nothing. Case in point: ""Dick Filet"" feels undeveloped and just deflates rather than conclude satisfyingly. Songs like that and ""Felching Filth"" have some good moments, but are screaming to be fleshed out with a guitar solo or a good bridge section. Because so many tracks are competing for the dankest chugs, weaker songs like ""Posthumous Compersion"" will inevitably get skipped over on repeat listens. There's also a general over saturation of pinch harmonics, the worst offender being the opening riff to ""Gored in the Chest,"" which sounds like corny circus music. While they're essential to achieving that brutal death sound, there are times on this album when they feel more like a crutch.    But regardless of its issues, Sanguisugabogg's debut puts them near the head of the hunting party among caveman death metal. It's blunt and nasty, a tongue-in-cheek ode to the odious.

2021-03-24,Rhys Juergensen,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Tune-Yards' Signature Style Makes Their Modern-Day Musings Stand Out on 'sketchy.',,"The duo of Merrill Garbus and Nate Brenner have been making substantial noise as Tune-Yards for over a decade now, including their 2011 breakout album,  w h o k i l l , and  the score  to 2018 film  Sorry to Bother You .  sketchy. , the project's fifth studio record, takes listeners to a world where spacy trap and glitchy alt-rock play host to a wide array of topical subject matter. Imagine Massive Attack's instrumentals combined with Bob Dylan's lyrics plus a gratuitous helping of John Frusciante-style harmonic soundscapes, which Garbus creates by looping and layering her vocal tracks.     That said,  sketchy.  can't be reduced to a formula. A few of the album's songs make reference to an eclectic array of genres: opening track ""nowhere, man"" goes a bit swing, pairing a late-night, electro-jazz instrumental with Garbus' unique version of scat singing. ""homewrecker"" and ""be not afraid."" are bass-heavy odes to industrial grunge. ""hold yourself.,"" with its dreamy synth pop, feel-good sax, and karaoke-friendly vocal hooks, is an unequivocal revisitation of the '80s. In many ways,  sketchy.  represents what we've come to expect from Tune-Yards: it's interesting, unconventional, and intense.     sketchy.  offers the kind of music that's best enjoyed alone at 2 a.m. with a helping of psychedelics, but  it's more than a late-night trip — it's a pensive, provocative experience. The record puts Garbus's most visceral feelings to lyrical and musical form: with singular and directed focus, the album addresses some of the most pressing social, cultural, and political concerns in her world. Though drumming on tracks like ""make it right."" and ""hypnotized"" occasionally overpower the songwriting, the songs are redeemed by Garbus' vocal wizardry. In the verses, she meanders all over the scale in an offhand way, but dishes out a cathartic climax of soaring harmonies that make for some epic choruses.    What's made Tune-Yards' music enjoyable in the past is Garbus's undiluted individuality — her talented writing, distinct voice, and signature style. And though  sketchy.  weighs in on a number of issues that are particularly pertinent in today's milieu, it doesn't compromise the album's sincerity. The record's explicit, prose-style lyrics manage to convey strong levels of intimacy precisely because Garbus says what she means, and means what she says. Many artists are quick to adopt a prefab script of righteous indignation, but Garbus and Brenner don't take shortcuts.     ""make it right."" calls out Baby Boomers for a comprehensive set of mistakes. Garbus sings, ""How much would it take / was he willing for his children's sake / to look ahead as a human, and make it right?"" In a similar vein, ""hold yourself."" criticizes '80s excess — and those who grew up in it — as much as it stylistically refers to its music. Not leaving much to the imagination, Garbus sings, ""Parents, they made us, they tried to raise us / but parents betrayed us, even when they tried / they hold us closely while telling us lies they told themselves.""    On ""homewrecker,"" Garbus sings, ""A home will make me strong / a pre-approval for a life of wiping history away / a pre-approval for a debt that I will never pay."" The words aren't subtle, but they are well-composed and evocative. They're the result of reflection, emotion, criticality, and most importantly, skill. And that's why, amongst the crowd of artists desperately clamouring for cultural relevance,  sketchy.  manages to say something genuinely meaningful.

2021-03-24,Ian Gormely,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",dad sports Give Everyday Situations Deeper Meaning on 'I AM JUST A BOY LEAVE ME ALONE !!!',,"Back in the '90s, it was de rigueur for alt-rock Neanderthals to howl about some sort of undefined pain. Though the meaning of their words was dubious — can anyone please explain  ""Bad moon wine again""  to me? — the subtext was clear: 'What I have to say is Very Important.'    What a difference a few decades make. Today, many bands tend toward plainspoken tales about anxiety and degrading mental health with the conviction of someone humming in the shower. The subtext now: 'Oh, don't mind me... I'm just going through some things.'    Enter  dad sports , a self-styled bedroom pop power trio from the suburbs of Ottawa, whose pillowy aesthetics bely a strong foundation in more traditional rock tropes. The six songs on the band's debut EP,   I AM JUST A BOY LEAVE ME ALONE !​!​! , capture small moments of interpersonal struggle. The text-style small-caps songs titles and self-shot music videos featuring the trio goofing off around their hometown in neon-coloured ski jackets, and would seem to serve to reaffirm their supposedly frivolous music.     But the band, composed of singer-guitarist Miguel Plante, bass player Alex Keyes and drummer Kevin McDonald, have a knack for imbuing what should be benign situations with deeper meaning. On the surface, ""gf haircut"" is about just that, but it's also about the unspoken issues that arise in any relationship. ""I hope it's not too late to talk about us now,"" Plante repeats in the song's outro, presumably while getting his locks shorn, an act of trust intimacy if ever there was one.    Small scale anxieties run throughout the record. There's a twee vibe to lyrics like ""Do you wanna hang? Maybe after school?"" from opener ""out 4 a Breather,"" but again, there's more than meets the eye. Here, Plante captures all the worry and apprehension that comes when figuring out when the object of their affection feels the same way. He's most explicit on ""nrvs again,"" where the singer comes out and says flatly ""Feels like I'm nervous again, though it doesn't take much these days."" There's a impulse to read each song as a comment on These Times, but the timeline of their creation remains murky. Regardless the songs work with or without our current context, though the former certainly adds another dimension.    Though they only dropped their first single at the end of 2018, their progression has been rapid. Early singles like ""dog cuddles"" showcased an affection for the gauzy bedroom pop; on ""romeo"" in 2019, their songwriting finally caught up with their aesthetic choices, setting the stage for  I AM JUST A BOY.     Self-producing all their material — Plante and McDonald met in a music production class at school — dad sports songs are filled with swelling synths, chopped-up vocal samples and guitars that don't sound like guitars à la the 1975. Yet these sounds mask (but don't detract from) the jangly guitar-bass-drums bones at the core of their work, with Plante's chiming guitars forming the bridge between '80s indie and du jour bedroom pop few thought existed.      Whether intentional or not, the bait and switch in their presentation works in the band's favour. By disarming listeners with soft sounds, dad sports manage to smuggle their songs out of the playlist-core basement and into the broader indie rock ecosystem.

If you're looking to stand out creatively while exploring such well-trodden territory, you better come with a fresh spin, a vision or perspective that elevates you from the fray.  Benny the Butcher  is that dude. His pen bleeds ink, and his voice is dripping with wisdom earned the hard way.    Even after knocking out the first Billboard chart-topping record of the prolific Griselda onslaught — 2020's Hit-Boy collaboration LP  Burden of Proof  — the 36-year-old former street pharmacist can't forget where he came from. Hell, the man was shot in the leg and robbed for his chain just a few months back in Houston.    The shadows of the trap loom large on Benny's dense and detailed  The Plugs I Met 2  EP, the sequel to 2019's impeccable original with producer DJ Shay. This time, New York underground producer  Harry Fraud 's soundscape elevates both the melancholy and menace to cinematic heights.    Standouts abound in this nine-track, 28-minute dose of this reality you don't want to live, this world where murders go ""unsolved like a Tupac case."" Yes, Benny invites some brand-name guests aboard: French Montana, Fat Joe, Jim Jones, Action Bronson and an on-point 2 Chainz, who drops the LOL line ""I only care about me / Tell you 'happy birthday' on the wrong day."" But the late bloomer is never outshone on his own tape.    His rapid-fire manner of nut-shelling his former career is addictive. Some examples: ""Street niggas won't outlive their grandparents""; ""My neighbourhood was super dangerous / A record deal would get you lit, but a robbery would make you super famous""; ""You ain't a boss / Everybody on your team just broke.""    Wrestling with survivor's guilt and oscillating between pride and paranoia, Buffalo's great game-spitter grabs the mic with deliberate intent, tucking jewels into single lines and enunciating every adlib and detail. The man knows how to colour a scene and self-analyze.    ""This supposed to be success, then why the fuck I feel stressed out and guilty? / Damn, 'cause I'm paid and all my niggas in the feds or the grave — that shit kill me / That coulda been me,"" Benny rhymes on the excellent ""Survivor's Remorse.""    That Benny has endured the worst, that he managed to turn breadcrumbs into hedge funds, has empowered him to seize this spotlight. The themes might be as old as the genre itself, but the voice is as fresh and focused as any.    Now that he's out of bars, he has no intent to waste bars. As LeBron James tweeted upon the release of  Plugs 2 : ""Man I get so excited when [Benny the Butcher] drop new music!!! Only a few I juiced for and he's one of them.""

2021-03-25,Bryon Hayes,8,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Colin Fisher Pushes Instruments in New Directions on 'Reflections of the Invisible World',,"Toronto-based multi-instrumentalist  Colin Fisher  continually pushes his music in new directions. His guitar and saxophone are malleable in his hands, and he stretches the vocabularies of his instruments through electronic sculpting. With 2018's  V Le Pape , Fisher began exploring the softer side of his exploratory tendencies. Straying from the frenetic free jazz proffered by  Not the Wind, Not the Flag  — his duo with percussionist Brandon Valdivia — and exploring new age tendencies, the album featured ornate guitar passages finely honed by electronic processing.    While  V Le Pape  certainly showcased a new direction for Fisher, it was merely a first step toward a greater goal.  Reflections of the Invisible World  takes up the mantle of its predecessor and expands on the instrument-as-raw material operational mode that Fisher has been exploring. There are more layers, arranged into complex patterns and rich textures. Fisher employs both intricate guitar melodies and wafting breaths of saxophone, weaving them together into nocturnal emanations that rise like steam from the streets of a misty metropolis. One can't help but wonder if the presence of producer  Jeremy Greenspan  of  Junior Boys  drove Fisher to push his already sweeping vision even further.    Fisher opens the record with a call to arms, signifying the direction he will take for the majority of the album. ""Zero Experience"" is constructed of layers of processed guitar, yet it unfolds like a waxen structure becoming liquified and taking on a new shape. Only bare traces of the instrument are apparent. He boils the guitar strings in electronics, wringing out grains of sound that coalesce into clouds. When he employs his saxophone, such as on ""Coalescence,"" its woozy timbre adds a hint of jazz. More accurately, Fisher's sax is the ghostly doppelganger of jazz, a David Lynch-inspired version that verges on the uncanny.    Stepping out from behind the veil of electronics, Fisher closes the album with ""Sanctum,"" a minimally processed duet of guitar and saxophone. It's here where his instrumental prowess shines through. Ringing chords wrap themselves around Fisher's breathy yet lyrical saxophone. In the midst of the incantation, he executes a series of guitar solos that are at once incredibly quick and highly melodic. It's almost as if Fisher wants to bring his listeners back down from orbit after they've consumed the dreamy vistas he just finished presenting. This act of elevating and then grounding the proceedings creates a narrative arc within the album, transforming  Reflections of the Invisible World  from a collection of experiments into a fully realized vision woven by a master sonic storyteller.

Instead of lacing the album with pastoral, banjo-based tunes, doom and gloom take precedence here, creating atmospheres that are more ominous and unsettling than their previous works. Boosted considerably by veteran mastering engineer Sarah Register (Big Thief, the Shins, Depeche Mode) and local engineer Alex Gamble (Alvvays, Arkells, Broken Social Scene), every note is clean, purposeful and well-constructed.     In more ways than one,  Ego Death  is a deceptive album. While it begins hauntingly (""Born to Win""), it soon ventures into more calming territory, with ""Find Me"" and ""Three Star System"" drenched in swirling, phase-heavy tranquility. Still, remnants of their former folky selves do remain, with the dulcet  ""Sweet Tea""  and the earthy ""See the Light"" exemplifying their ability to craft lush, layered acoustic music.    Because of the duality of the arrangements, the record is somewhat difficult to classify. At times, the band is firmly grounded in folk and baroque pop structures, while other arrangements see them explore thicker, rockier styles. Either way,  Ego Death  is a diverse and layered record that, regardless of classification, is unique in its composition.    At times, the harmonies and contours produced by bandleader Anna M ē rnieks-Duffield and fellow vocalist Heather Mazhar sound oddly reminiscent of ABBA; portions of ""Til the Morning Comes"" are eerily reminiscent of ""Chiquitita,"" perhaps unintentionally so. Elsewhere though, M ē rnieks-Duffield soars alone, laying down smooth vocal lines alongside her band.    Though recorded in the fall of 2018 and the summer of 2019,  Ego Death  sometimes seems downright clairvoyant, with much of the lyrical content addressing themes that now seem oddly prescient to the world of 2021. For instance, the opening line of ""Time Drain"" alludes to the shattering realities of a hellish year (""This year came in like a sledgehammer"").     Like many excellent musical experiences,  Ego Death  is a record that needs to be listened to more than once to be truly appreciated.

2021-03-30,Allie Gregory,8,"POP AND ROCK,JAZZ,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Toronto Saxophonist Emily Steinwall Is a Force for Unity on 'Welcome to the Garden',,"In the midst of fractured social structures and insurmountable isolation, Toronto saxophonist  Emily Steinwall  is a force for togetherness and connectivity. It's more than a mission statement for the 26-year-old composer — it's the thesis for her debut full-length album,  Welcome to the Garden . The conceptual project finds Steinwall hungry for unity in a way that presents itself as both cannibalistic and celestial. She blends care and tenderness into the mix as she positions herself as a binding element of textures, moods and complex sonic palettes.    Those themes are best capsulized in the record's epic 10-minute title track, a psychedelic orgy of sound that delivers on its promise to embrace listeners into its darkened depths. Fae trickery abound, the track is less an open door than it is a siren call, evoking the innate and eternal power of Mother Nature, the diabolical, sublime spirit of the wilderness and, by proxy, womanhood. The song's complex arrangement — featuring undulating vocals, swirling flute, delicate keys and an intoxicating mid-track saxophone solo — simultaneously emit an air of wickedness and warmth, suggesting the creeping, mycelial quality of divination.     Threading in a gentler tone, daylight breaks in the album's second track ""Bloom,"" which features vocal assistance by Toronto-based singer-songwriter Kyla Charter. Here, Steinwall makes a hard romantic U-turn, blending airiness and harmony with upbeat, jazzy guitar. Where ""Late Night Romantic"" employs a similar tenderness, Steinwall aims her love inward this turn, swelling gently in the short two-minute vignette filled out by soft piano and ethereal flute.    ""Back to Earth,"" another album highlight, is a paradoxically cosmic piece of sonic cinematics, with vocal arrangements akin to that of Corinne Bailey Rae or Winnipeg's Begonia. Conceptually, Steinwall links the song to the album through its lovey-dovey connectivity, though again, the track leans more in the direction of self-love. It's a euphoric, affirming chapter from the Garden, with a healthy six-minute runtime grounded by themes of ephemerality and a pulsating drumline. Otherworldly transmission ""Everlasting Love"" offers a poppy, joyous reprieve from the album's heavier tones, taking on an almost Disney-like quality as Steinwall sings, ""I am just stardust learning to find its way home / My heart will guide me back no matter where I roam / 'Cause you are my home.""    Most of the album's seven tracks offer up at least five minutes each, serving portions of lushness, enchanting femininity and disarming earnestness at each turn. Steinwall's impressive debut is truly an honour to behold.

2021-03-30,Luke Fox,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Kota the Friend and Statik Selektah Are All Smiles on 'To Kill a Sunrise',,"It feels supremely fitting that  Kota the Friend  would drop his latest platter at the outset of spring. Breezy and light, the fiercely independent Brooklyn rhymer's  To Kill a Sunrise  is easy-listening rap music custom-built for porch beers and bike rides. No filler, no skips.     Kota's new joint is a tight 10-track, 34-minute project that hums along cohesively thanks to sole producer  Statik Selektah , who expertly caters his soundbeds toward the lyricist he's working with, and Kota's knack for sliding into the grooves like syrup. The unapologetic jazz leanings here — horns! pianos! melodies! — harken back to a warm and nostalgic era of the genre. But Statik, who cut his teeth as a DJ first, makes certain to ground every track with hard New York kickdrums and snares, spicing the proceedings with scratchy flourishes (the BDP chop on ""Live & Direct,"" especially). The producer earns his co-marquee status on the LP.     Longtime heads will experience flashbacks of early Gang Starr or Unspoken Heard. More recent vibe comparables may be early Joey Badass or recent Bas or Blu & Exile. Fine company, all. Cuss words are scarce, and Kota's rare bouts with anger or pain are always spun optimistic. ""Lotta people just focus on how empty their glass is,"" observes Kota, determined not to be one of those people. Every regret comes packaged with hope: ""Mama, I'm gonna find my way."" Wise beyond his 28 years, this is a young father and grown son that positions himself as a role model, an example.     The Friend's wholly positive outlook includes a relentless work ethic, a setting aside of vendettas, and a healthy diet. It's been a minute since we've heard a rising hip-hop star preach the merits of self-improvement and ""emotional growth."" Kota has reportedly turned down three deals from major labels in favour of controlling his own creations, his own image. ""Seen a lot of people movin' fast-paced end up last place / Slow and steady how I move now,"" he raps.     If there is a downside to such a grounded approach, it's that  Sunrise  could use a 'wow' moment, a mood-shifting cameo. In that respect, the record doesn't quite match the allure of 2020's excellent  EVERYTHING . A deeper dive into some of the surface-level introspection would also go a long way. The emcee alludes to some father-inflicted childhood trauma (""Live & Direct"") and a stuck romantic relationship (""Go Now""), but the listener senses there is another level of writing that could be plumbed here.     That's alright. The prolific, poetic Kota has a whole career ahead of him. And on its own,  To Kill a Sunrise  works nicely serves as an ideal soundtrack to a lazy Sunday or the first barbecue of the season.

2021-03-18,Yara El-Soueidi,7,"ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS,PUNK","Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's Les Shirley's 'Forever Is Now'",,"Punk's not dead — just listen to  Forever Is Now , the debut album from Montreal trio  Les Shirley .    Singer-guitarist Raphaëlle Chouinard, bassist Sarah Dion and drummer Lisandre Bourdages (the latter two of similarly minded Montrealers NOBRO) decided to form Les Shirley after a night of drinks, combining their appreciation of punk, emo and ska to make music that best represented themselves.  Forever Is Now  positions them as true punk rockers, and they deliver an album that goes beyond all expectations.    Every song takes inspiration from a different sound of the pop-punk era, when Californian bands reigned supreme. With ""Fuck It, I'm in Love,"" the first few notes of guitar remind you of the distinct sound of bands signed to Epitaph Records during the '90s. Raphaëlle Chouinard's raspy voice cuts through the din, as she speeds her way through the songs — an exercise she repeats on the rapid-fire ""Sadgirlsclub,"" a 77 seconds of explosive energy that lists all the ways women are judged by men.    Chouinard's guitar playing is excellent. Her riffs and solos, like those on ""23,"" ring through just as distinctively as her voice. But the album doesn't rely solely on her talent. She is surrounded by Dion's masterful bass and Bourdages' fierce energy on the drums. The three women are truly at their best on ""Trigger,"" an exercise in power that drives its force through every element it brings.    What the album lacks is a unique sound, one that belongs solely to Les Shirley. As much as it holds its own,  Forever Is Now  relies heavily on existing musical blueprints. It's a proven recipe that works every time. Sticking with what works seems is fine for now, but it might be an obstacle further down the road for Les Shirley. The women have mastered energetic punk, but rock ballads like ""1994"" and ""Pick Up the Phone"" slow the album down. Les Shirley pull off these slower tempos, but they don't sound quite as comfortable.    Les Shirley are already defining the punk rock scene with their strong attitude. Even if they still have some sonic exploration to do, they are still contributing to a scene that needs more bands like them. The Montreal punk rock scene has found its rightful queens in Les Shirley.

2021-03-18,Yara El-Soueidi,6,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Jane Inc Goes in Every Direction at Once on 'Number One',,"In the past year, conversations surrounding mental health and social media have taken an important place in the media discourse. They have also started to influence the current work of numerous artists, including  Jane Inc , the solo project of  Ice Cream 's Carlyn Bezic. Her first album,  Number One , explores questions of self-reflection and self-image.    With  Number One , Bezic offers an album that doesn't stray too far from what she does with Ice Cream. Still sticking to her roots in experimental pop, the sounds are colourful, evoking a party or a night at a disco. The first track, ""Gem,"" gives the impression of entering a modern-day Studio 54. The instruments come together to create a heavy disco beat, a reminder of long nights filled with dance and well-dressed people. The album is carefully crafted around this spirit while addressing mental health, as if Bezic is showing how our identities are merely social media constructs through a music genre heavily influenced by beauty and flamboyant aesthetics.    While some songs are powerful and well delivered — notably ""Gem,"" ""Dirt and the Earth,"" ""My Oldest Friend"" and ""Obliterated"" — others clash with the album's overall concept. There isn't a clear direction that guides  Number One , making it easy for listeners to feel lost between each song transition.    Individually, each of these tracks has room to land. ""Faceless"" is an interesting experimental interlude that soothes, but it loses sense between ""Steel"" and ""Dirt and the Earth."" ""Steel"" could have had its moment of glory on the album, but it is overshadowed by coming right after the opener and strongest song of the album, ""Gem.""    Bezic explores different aspects of her artistry, but the lack of coherence impacts the listening experience, and some of the experimental songs stick out. ""Mine/His"" and ""Bloom Becomes Me"" are great songs that would have benefited from being on another album.    This being said,  Number One  still manages to be a heartfelt and honest first album. Bezic knows how to create a story through her songs and deliver high-quality tracks, proving she is indeed an accomplished solo artist. She explores subjects in her songs that aren't easy to handle, all while creating an experimental soundtrack that wants to make us dance and explore our own relationship to both image and identity.    Even with its lack of coherence,  Number One  proves that Jane Inc is here to stay. This first album is a prelude to a promising solo career for Carlyn Bezic — one that should make her an act to follow for the next few years.

2021-03-18,Oliver Crook,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Michael Feuerstack's 'Harmonize the Moon' Captures the Loneliness of Our Current Moment,,"Is  Michael Feuerstack  Canada's most underrated songwriter? Since 1994, he's put out 13 solo albums (nine under the moniker  Snailhouse , four under his own name), plus six as the guitarist for  the Wooden Stars , several with  Bell Orchestre  (including this week's  House Music , which shares a release day with  Harmonize the Moon ) and more guest spots and compilations than anyone could count. While his prolificacy is impressive, the consistency is staggering. Regardless of the project, there's clearly a classic Feuerstack sound he operates within, adding just enough twists to keep it fresh.    This isn't to call Feuerstack formulaic. His catalogue has carried this framework through a variety of sonic soundscapes, proving he's a workhorse who knows his strengths rather than a one-trick pony. His 14th solo album,  Harmonize the Moon , continues this trend.    Still present is his ponderous acoustic guitar, his monotone but wise voice, and the atmospheric sounds that swirl behind him. His gut-punch lyrics sit atop it all, making you feel seen and sad in equal measures (""They won't even hear you and why should they? / The birds belittle your song."")    Yet it's also different. Coronavirus lockdowns, while incredibly difficult, created a situation where Feuerstack's natural musical inclinations — sparsity, silence, simplicity — are all intensified. Arranged and recorded alone in his apartment, the room feels like another instrument. It adds a depth to the sound, a deeper well from which his words echo out of.    Loneliness has always been a key ingredient in the Feuerstack recipe, but  Harmonize the Moon  seems to capture this better than most. Look no further than the haunting ""You Can Relax"" or the pensive ""I Used to Be a Singer"" to hear sadness in action.    Quarantine also shows up in the album's pacing: while never an uptempo artist, Feuerstack has seemingly slowed down even more. From the eternity-feeling pause between verse and chorus on ""Too Kind"" to the drifting sensation you get listening to ""Valley,"" this album lives to mess with our concept of time. The fingerpicking is ponderous, the melodies sweet but slow. ""In The Waiting Room"" hammers this home: a slow, wandering track through a location designed to test our patience, it's brilliance seemingly grows with every listen.    Feuerstack's latest offering isn't cashing in our universal trauma. The pandemic isn't mentioned in the lyrics, there's no hints of it in the artwork. Yet it's subtle traces are there: in his prose of the power of nature, in the random snippets of conversations and life sounds that permeates the more tender moments.     Harmonize the Moon  is an album you can sit a long time with, pass an afternoon dissecting lyrics and floating between the layers. Like any Feuerstack album, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it changes enough to be rewarding. Feuerstack may never get his credit as one of our country's premier songwriters, but  Harmonize the Moon  is another glowing example of why should.

2021-03-19,Brock Thiessen,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,JAZZ,SOUNDTRACKS,MUSIC",Piero Piccioni's Lost Legacy Shines Bright on 'Volubile',,"In the world of Italian film music,  Piero Piccioni  has emerged as a truly legendary figure, with the maestro composing countless scores and more than a few classics over his many years. And while Piccioni may have shuffled off this mortal coil in 2004, the composer's vast vaults continue to surprise and amaze, as labels uncover and restore previously unheard gems. High among those in 2021 is now  Volubile  — a lost and now found early Piccioni work.    Originally captured in 1961, Volubile  came for the Italian TV show of the same name, and the soundtrack stands as one of Piccioni's very first. But despite the early time stamp,  Volubile  already shows off some prime Piccioni, with many of his sonic calling cards already on full display.    For one,  Volubile  already features Piccioni working with his favourite vocalist Lydia MacDonald, who would go on to collaborate frequently with the composer. And like much of Piccioni's earlier work, his jazz chops — both crime and big band — are often front and centre, though  Volubile  also already finds him flirting with more exotic sounds, both from the Far East and those of more tropical origins.    But a bit surprisingly for a Piccioni release,  Volubile  is a very vocal effort. Not only does MacDonald appear frequently, but the soundtrack also features a series of notable Italian vocalist from the era, such as Bruno Martino, Jimmy Fontana and Little Tony. And while these voices make  Volubile  a unique and welcomed addition to Piccioni canon, it's still his arrangements that shine through to take centre stage, with Piccioni stepping forward with his most melodic side.      In many ways , Volubile  exists in a similar cabaret headspace as his preceding effort, 1959's  Il Mondo Di Notte  and, in a sense, Ennio Morricone's underrated '64 effort  Musica Sul Velluto  — an album that also featured the vocal prowess of Lydia MacDonald and Jimmy Fontana.    Add in some great remastering and curation at the hands of  Camille 3000  — the label run by the late maestro's son, Jason Piccioni — and  Volubile  is a must for any self-respecting Piero Piccioni fan. It's just a real shame it took 60 years to finally get here.

2021-03-22,Max Heilman,8,"ALBUM,R&B,REVIEWS,MUSIC",serpentwithfeet Becomes the 'DEACON' of His Own Church of Love,,"The repurposing of gospel music defines Josiah Wise's alter ego  serpentwithfeet , reconciling his religious upbringing with his sexual identity. To that effect, 2018's  soil  essentially treated gospel like an avant-garde opera. Bombastic and harrowing, yet sensual and alluring, Wise imbued this album with his classically-trained voice and gospel roots, firmly establishing it as a front-runner for experimental pop and soul. Compared to such a striking debut, the silky R&B flavours of  DEACON  are definitely more palatable — and that's just how Wise wants it!     Similarly to how a church's deacon strives for order within the organization, Wise's latest effort seeks to balm the effects of a chaotic world with 29 minutes of soothing love songs, including closer ""Fellowship,"" a wholesome ode to Wise's friends. The single spotlights his virtuosic, captivating voice, supported by detailed, multilayered production. Wise retains his musicality while fully embracing R&B sensibilities.     Wise's elaborate vocal runs, unpredictable melodic phrasing and distinct timbre elevate the pristine keyboards and ethereal beat of ""Same Size Shoe."" He expresses his desire for a soulmate who can fully relate to him as a Black man: ""Boy, you got my trust 'cause I'm like you."" After the complex emotional rollercoaster of  soil , it's genuinely beautiful to hear Wise sing about sharing everything from a favourite chorus to a barber with a significant other.      DEACON  essentially takes the ""blues"" out of rhythm and blues, making it a beacon of light for the intersection of Black and gay love. There's no heartbreak to hold back opener ""Hyacinth"" from submerging like a bath bomb of glossy guitars and piano in a tub full of heartwarming lines like ""He never played football / But look at how he holds me."" In the same way, ""Amir"" rides the butterfly sensation of asking someone on a date into a sunset of throwback '90s R&B production. Wise's rapturous idiosyncrasies effortlessly aggrandize this cut's accessible template.     Clocking in at under half an hour,  DEACON  does miss out on some opportunities to flesh out certain ideas. This is most obvious on the 40-second a cappella piece ""Dawn."" The song could've used more time to develop its choirlike arrangement à la Jacob Collier, though it works just fine as an interlude. ""Malik"" and ""Derrick's Beard"" do a better job of growing their respective uptempo snap-track and moody piano balladry. Both cuts ooze palpable sultriness, whether it's the former's light-hearted bounce (""Peace to your daddy that made you so fine"") or the latter's yearning ambiance (""Come over here / Missing your beard"").     The way ""Derrick's Beard"" maintains interest while centering on two lines is a testament to Wise's approach to arrangement. In a genre that tends to focus on acrobatic singing instead of instrumentation, this album has both in spades. The sub-bass thud, whacking backbeat and miscellaneous chimes found in ""Wood Boy"" reflect the ecstasy Wise gets lost in with his partner.     Similarly, ""Old & Fine"" embellishes minimalist beats, spiritual championing and dazzling vocal flourishes with what sounds like a processed bell choir. Even within a hookier context, serpentwithfeet's songwriting remains deeply impressionistic — an evolving canvas on which he can paint with his illustrious melodies. This well-conceived balance greatly benefits the expansive soundscape of reverberant tones and massive drops of ""Heart Storm."" It provides the perfect backdrop for Wise to duet with British avant-soul singer NAO; their voices compare and contrast naturally, knowing when to take the reins and when to support one another.      DEACON  is certainly a less confrontational album than  soil , but the album's inviting sound allows Wise's raw talent to shine all the brighter. Under a charmingly simple exterior of love and passion lies powerful depth and expertise.  DEACON 's memorable songwriting and jovial themes compellingly manifest Wise's affable side.

2021-03-22,Vish Khanna,9,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS",Sloan/Super Friendz/Inbreds Supergroup TUNS Yield Even Richer Results on 'Duly Noted',,"Based on a decades-long friendship between three men whose parallel creative paths have finally converged,  TUNS  exude warmth and joy in their uniquely and cleverly composed rock sound. After nailing it out of the gate on their 2016 self-titled debut,  Chris Murphy  ( Sloan ), Matt Murphy ( the Super Friendz ), and  Mike O'Neill  ( the Inbreds ) bring us   Duly Noted , proving that TUNS' camaraderie experiment can yield even richer results than initially estimated.     The equality of opinions and ideas is evident in the distribution of labour here, as each member sings four songs they've written, with thematic throughlines evident in their expression. Those who follow Sloan know that Chris Murphy is an observational and autobiographical writer, unafraid to reveal wishful thinking, self-consciousness and his general state of mind. Here though, he blends in some fantastical narrative tricks for songs about gossip and innuendo (the peppy ""Everybody Knows"" and ""Keeping Options Open"") along with work-life balance woes (on Clash-like opener ""In the Middle of the Way Home""). We may be learning the most about him and his persistent personality and age defiance with the classic rock banger and card trick, ""Double Down.""     For his brother-from-another-mother-with-the-same-last-name, Matt Murphy, things are a little sunnier and romantic. He sings about how he'd valiantly ""change for you"" on ""We Stand United,"" a ripper of a love song that also conjures the Clash (at one point, Joe Strummer's ""Safe European Home,"" specifically), while a similar sentiment is conveyed on the relatively gentle album closer, ""We're Living in it Now,"" which takes stock of and celebrates a relationship that is hitting its stride. The krautrock/Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet feel of ""Flags for Curtains"" spurs Matt Murphy to take on his most biting, edgy voice, while he provides the album's most adventurous and infectious two-songs-in-one garage-pop jam with ""I'll Only Love You More.""     As is his wont, Mike O'Neill is the hit-making dark horse in TUNS, modestly singing beautifully while coming up with very high-level, whimsical lyrics that reflect upon love, friendship and his lot in life. ""I cannot help my memories"" he sings on the indie-rock radio-ready ""My Memories,"" which is an unlikely hook; it's so multi-layered in its meaning and yet so starkly simple, plus it's phrased so well, it does some meta work by being truly unforgettable. Not that it's always easy; on the spirited ""Words and Music,"" O'Neill sings about how hard it can be to write the lyrics to a TUNS song and then, of course, they're funny, revealing words. This follows ""In Another Life,"" in which O'Neill daydreams about a life that might have been better than the one he has led but also couldn't possibly top it because he has the luxury of contentment. It's the kind of existential stuff O'Neill does so well, as evident on ""Holding My Breath,"" which is a clever play on imposter syndrome and internalized external pressure, using motifs one might associate with a magician.     Given how committed to excellence these three songwriters are, there are some wonderful frills to the collage of effort that conjures TUNS' music. Distinct and strong singers, they do not settle for safe back-ups or harmonies; as they've done in the past, TUNS will inform the lyrics by occasionally forming a Greek chorus who speak to whomever is singing lead, calmly measuring their emotion with reason. The guitar-bass-drums musical interplay too is beyond compare — three of the best players anywhere who guise musical sophistication in songs the whole family can enjoy.  (Murderecords/Universal)                           POP AND ROCK   ALBUM   MUSIC   REVIEWS              More TUNS",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/tuns_duly_noted_album_review
2021-03-22,Safiya Hopfe,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Lana Del Rey's 'Chemtrails over the Country Club' Is as Flawed as the American Dream Itself,,"When  Lana Del Rey  burst onto the scene in 2011, critics had a hard time buying her diamond-encrusted sad-girl shtick. Her 2012 major label debut,  Born to Die , was derided as a cliché-riddled dreamscape, and as Lana continued with  Ultraviolence ,  Honeymoon  and  Lust for Life , it was hard to tell whether her patriotic beach-ballads of romance and recklessness were cheeky, honest, or both.    But by 2019, she had found a newly graceful stride chronicling the ecstatic agony of searching for freedom in America's self-indulgent coastal imagination. That year's  Norman Fucking Rockwell!  topped numerous year-end lists,  including our own .    Her sixth studio album,  Chemtrails over the Country Club , swaps  NFR! 's adored orchestral grandeur for delicate depth. Produced again with  Jack Antonoff , it is folksier, centring Lana's poetic voice in a stripped-down version of the world she's spent her career building. Thin layers of trip-hop ambience are woven into acoustic twang and breezy vocals. Lana ponders God, simple romance and wanderlust.    The album's most gorgeous moments are its most timid, its most tragic. In opener ""White Dress,"" Lana's crackling falsetto mourns the distance between her and ""simpler days"" when feeling eyes on her as she waited tables was enough. ""It made me feel like a God,"" she sings. ""It was such a scene / and I felt seen.""    Over the course of her first four albums, Lana embraced a hollow fantasy of American exceptionalism coloured by white lines, pretty beaches and broken men.  Norman Fucking Rockwell!  did the same, but with more wit and truth. The authenticity of  Chemtrails  makes it once and for all impossible to believe that Lana's longing reflections on the romance of Americana-dreaming are ironic.     In the past, many wondered whether Lana was for real, and to what extent ""Lanaland"" had been fabricated for consumption. On  Chemtrails , it becomes clear that this is the wrong question to ask. Even if the world of Lana is artifice, it is real in these songs. Dripping with nostalgia and a tender desperation, Chemtrails pleads: what if this is all there is? And if it isn't, then what?    Lana's music is a perfect product of the American Dream. And it is a dream that has never felt more dangerous, as America's faulty foundations crumble before our eyes.    Like any product of the American Dream, Lana and her work are riddled with white-washed wilful ignorance: an ignorance as pleasant for the privileged to escape into as it is harmful for everyone else. In the last year, she has been criticized for  racist remarks ,  a tone-deaf statement that Trump's presidency was ""necessary,""  and  for posting clips of looters during Black Lives Matter protests . She has been scrutinized for the ways she has spoken about womanhood and abuse, saying that modern feminism lacks space for ""fragility"" and women like her.    As the public eye has zoomed in, we have been forced to recall that the glittering peak from which Lana sings is not hypothetical. Raised by New York aristocrats, she has been moulded in part by the glamorous upper middle class her art so melodramatically depicts. Although she was praised during Trump's presidency for breaking her tradition of performing in front of an American flag, it is hard to believe that she doesn't still sleep in one, as she sang in ""Cola"" in 2012.    She touches on the weight of fame and public scrutiny on  Chemtrails . On the record's title track, she declares, ""I don't care what they think / drag-racing my little red sports car."" ""Dark But Just A Game,"" on the other hand, reveals her discontent, as she sings, ""I was a pretty little thing / And got a lot to sing, but / Nothing came from either one but pain."" The chorus chimes, ""No rose left on the vines / Don't even want what's mine / Much less the fame.""    Perhaps Lana's world is now, more than ever, symbolic of America itself: a crumbling landscape of empty yearnings and plastic archetypes which distract, if only for a moment, from the violent truths bubbling beneath the surface.  Chemtrails over the Country Club  is sultry at times, syrupy sweet at others, and sad in a truer way than we have yet seen from Lana. It is a well-woven escape, but it is harder than ever not to wonder: at what cost?

And a small part it was, indeed.     Besides Bieber opening the album with the song ""2 Much,"" which uses a snippet of Martin Luther King speaking on injustice, as well as dedicating a whole track to Dr. King with ""MLK Interlude,"" the singer doesn't actually mention anything about justice on the album's 16 songs. Instead, the album feels like a continuation of his  self-proclaimed  R&B album  Changes , released only 13 months prior.    Just like on  Changes , Bieber just can't stop singing about his loving and wholesome relationship with his wife, Hailey. Songs like ""Deserve You,"" ""Off My Face"" and ""Unstable"" are slow melodic odes that reflect on how much the pop star and his wife have really grown together and have come a long way within their relationship. For the most part, the album is a collection of whimsical pop- and rock-inspired tracks.    Thankfully, Bieber switches it up a bit thanks to standouts like Afrobeats track ""Loved by You,"" featuring Nigerian artist  Burna Boy ,  Chance the Rapper  collab ""Holy,"" and TikTok favourite ""Peaches"" with Giveon and  Daniel Caesar . He even elicits empathy on ""Lonely,"" as the singer lays himself bare with lyrics such as, ""And everybody saw me sick / And it felt like no one gave a shit.""    Although Bieber created a decent body of work, it's hard to get past that the sentiments of the overall message is skewed by the lack of effort towards creating music that addresses any sort of justice or lack thereof. The title reeks of performative activism and goes to show how out of touch the singer truly is. Though the music is good, it's safe to say the album title doesn't do him or anyone else much justice at all.

2021-03-23,Chris Bryson,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Genghis Tron's 'Dream Weapon' Turns Humanity's End into an Epic Odyssey,,"Meditations on humanity's impact on the Earth will remain prevalent as the world continues to navigate challenging times. On   Dream Weapon ,  Genghis Tron  deliver vivid explorations of deep notions itching at the collective consciousness.     The follow-up to 2008's genre-defying  Board Up the House  is a bold progression of the band's sound. Michael Sochynsky, one of Genghis Tron's two founding members, has said that the band's style has always amalgamated their collective musical influences at the time. With  Dream Weapon , they continue this tradition as  Blanck Mass ' kaleidoscopic thrust,  Skinny Puppy 's industrial clatter and thump,  Cluster  and  Jon Hopkins ' cosmic electronics, and  Tool' s heavy and heady riffs and rhythms can be felt throughout, warped and merged into Genghis Tron's artistic vision.      Dream Weapon  marks the arrival of new vocalist Tony Wolski, whose dreamy, airy tenor pairs nicely with the band's evolved style. They've also added a live drummer, Nick Yacyshyn ( SUMAC / Baptists ), who provides a vital, natural energy behind the kit. Kurt Ballou, who produced Genghis Tron's first two LPs, recorded and produced  Dream Weapon , which also features additional engineering and production from Ben Chisholm (Chelsea Wolfe) and mastering by Heba Kadry, who together provide the band with a hefty yet luminous sound.      The album's concept finds the band expanding on ""Relief,""  Board Up the House 's closing track. Hamilton Jordan, Genghis Tron's other founding member, has said that ""Relief"" explored humanity's burden on the planet, Earth's enduring state after we're gone, and the inevitable sadness, beauty and relief that comes with this.  Dream Weapon  is a loosely based meditation on this theme, and while it follows the premise that humanity is past some point of no return, the most poignant lyrical notions come from aligning fatalistic metaphors with revelations that provide an air of possibility, both for people to question what they do in their lives now, and for the planet and its eventual liberation.     Musically,  Dream Weapon 's astral aura follows a similar arc through serene passages and epic movements of intensity and splendour. The album was intended to be more cohesive than previous efforts, and it plays out like a momentous and hypnotic psych-prog odyssey. After the cascading synths and swelling noise of opener ""Exit Perfect Mind,"" ""Pyrocene"" tears into it with heavy drums and buzzing bass, with keys and guitar snaking through the percussion and Wolski's vocals floating through the mix. Demolition crew drumming and tightly wound revolving riffs barrel through the title track, while the deep-space droning ambience of ""Desert Stairs"" offers a brief reprieve before blasting off again. Genghis Tron showcase their musical range on epic tracks ""Alone in the Heart of the Light,"" ""Ritual Circle"" and final reckoning closer ""Great Mother,"" with each of these weaving otherworldly elements and layers that build, surge, spiral, crush and soar.      The band's ability to meld genres and evolve remains a lasting strength. Some fans might not appreciate the shift in sound (most significantly, there are no screams or blast beats), but it's not like Genghis Tron didn't hint at the potential for this sort of progression on  Board Up the House,  and a lot of change can happen with over a decade between albums.  Dream Weapon  is a transportive odyssey that casts humanity's end as an inevitable reality with an opportunity for renewal, and offers a space where listeners can reflect on what that might mean to them, or just lay back and enjoy the ride.

2021-03-23,Daniel Sylvester,9,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Floating Points and Pharoah Sanders' 'Promises' Is More Mind Meld Than Collaboration,,"As a backing musician during John Coltrane's cosmic phase, throughout sessions with Alice Coltrane and Sun Ra, and spanning his 57 years as a fearless bandleader,  Pharoah Sanders  remains the last living arbiter and living legend in what's been known as ""spiritual jazz."" But on  Promises , the first LP to don his name since 2003's  The Creator Has a Master Plan , Sanders positions himself not as the focal point but as one of many elements that define this sweepingly stunning classical, jazz and electronic piece. Across the nine movements that make up the 46-minute LP, Sam Shepherd (a.k.a.  Floating Points ) never forces things into the nostalgic free jazz era that helped define his recording partner. He rather forms absorbing soundscapes to allow the duo to move into sounds, modes and moods completely outside of their respective comfort zones.      Although Shepherd has helmed his own 16-piece Floating Points Ensemble, the inclusion of the string section of the renowned London Symphony Orchestra makes this project even more ambitious and grandiose. But the British musician — playing a multitude of keys; piano, synth, organ, harpsichord — manages to keep everything sounding grounded and singular. Sanders breathes and sighs through his saxophone, allowing only elected notes to permeate this occasionally noisy, occasionally hushed set. Instead of elastic basslines and polyrhythmic drums that defined mid-'60s free jazz,  Promises  instead opens with an crystalline repeating synth sample as Sanders messes with the timing and phrasing of his sax melody before he skillfully moves into a musical conversation with this otherwise staid ambient pulse. As Shepherd elevates the atmospherics, Sanders begins to lock into a wriggling rhythm before unleashing his most rootless animated soloing.      As the album shifts into an almost noiseless decrescendo, a gloomy violin (perhaps the most straight-forward musical movement across the entire LP) leads the string section into sweeping Howard Shore soundtrack territory before bulging into musical apex that is so affecting as to sound almost menacing. While Sanders generally lays low throughout the middle of the recording, Shepherd melds his electronics into the physically distanced and sonically capacious orchestra. But as the musicians begin to ebb and flow toward the ninth and final movement, it's clear that Pharoah Sanders and Floating Points are so metaphysically in tune with their latest creation that their respective musical personalities almost disappear into the waves of sound, making  Promises  a recording that is more of a transcending mind meld than it is a collaboration.

2021-03-23,Dylan Barnabe,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Antlers' 'Green to Gold' Is a Coming-of-Age for the Modern Millennial,,"Take the traditional Bildungsroman, swap the protagonist for a man in his early thirties and set it to music — you'll immediately see what  the Antlers ' sixth album,  Green to Gold , is all about.     Following a seven-year hiatus after 2014's  Familiars ,  Peter Silberman  and Michael Lerner return with a master class in quiet contemplation and coming-of-age for the modern millennial. Musically pared back and stripped of any vestige of electronic influences from the days of Burst Apart, the starkly minimal  Green to Gold  draws close the intimacy of Silberman's hushed tones.     It's indie music, yes, but there are clear folk elements at play ⏤ something inherently pastoral, earthly and bound to the oral transmission of truth through song. The titular ""Green to Gold"" is a good example; a literal ode to the four seasons that charts the passage of time. ""Solstice,"" too, deals with this theme as Silberman croons ""The week went slow / The year flew by."" What should register as tired imagery and clichéd metaphors by all accounts is somehow rendered more true, genuine and haltingly beautiful given the Silberman and Lerner treatment.  Green to Gold  is, at times, quite literal in its depictions of Silberman's personal experiences and other times intensely figurative, staring into the void of existentialism (""Am I incidental?"" he asks on ""Volunteer"") with the kind of quiet assurance only the Antlers can evoke.       For once, the band's album doesn't haunt you like an untethered ghost as is the case with most of their material (the spectre of Hospice forever looms large). Instead it charts the rolling hills, long stretches of flat road, and peaks and valleys of growing into adulthood, as well as the inevitable loss of innocence and ossification of growing older.      While a reverence for Mother Nature is apparent across the album's 10 tracks, the heart of  Green to Gold 's most poignant tracks comes from looking inward. ""Stubborn Man"" and ""Just One Sec"" are both bittersweet meditationson what it means to be human and the limitations we cannot escape. ""Could you clear my cache momentarily? / For just one sec, free me from me,"" Silberman sings longingly. However, what could quickly spiral into a darkly depressing rumination on the meaning of life and invading cynicism of aging is saved by the strange comfort in knowing that we are following a pattern that nature itself has laid out. There is resignation, sure, but also acceptance. It is what it is.     In the immortal words of Robert Frost, ""Nothing gold can stay."" And on their latest venture, the Antlers help us come to terms with just that.  ( Anti )                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Antlers",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/the_antlers_green_to_gold_album_review
2021-03-09,Matt Bobkin,10,"POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Leanne Betasamosake Simpson Builds a Better World on 'Theory of Ice',,"The Earth is dying. The planet's temperature is slowly creeping upward, and age-old climate patterns are hurtling wildly out of order. And without governments willing to make radical, immediate change to regulate the multinational corporations who generate most of the world's greenhouse gasses, it's easy to imagine that the planet — and all of us who live on it — are on the way to an apocalyptic end.    But  Leanne Betasamosake Simpson  isn't going down without a fight. The acclaimed scholar, author and poet has devoted much of her career to utilizing Indigenous teachings in academia, and she works to incorporate many longstanding traditions and philosophies into today's colonized society, particularly those about respecting the land we live on.  Theory of Ice , her third album, transposes her strong narrative voice, honed by her many acclaimed books, lectures and poems, into the core of folk-rock arrangements alternately rapturous and confrontational. Where her previous albums, 2013's  Islands of Decolonial Love: Stories and Songs  and 2016's  f(l)ight  featured, more often than not, poetry backed by music,  Theory of Ice  breaks down the barriers completely.    Sometimes Simpson sings, other times she reads compellingly, always immersed in the music. Joined by an all-star band composed of sister  Ansley Simpson ,  Nick Ferrio ,  Jim Bryson  and  Jonas Bonnetta , the music of  Theory of Ice  morphs seamlessly between gently picked acoustic folk and roaring rock to best underpin Simpson's earnest pleas about the fate of the world. Each track is loaded with references to the many beauties of nature and the climate crisis that threatens them all; they flow together as a potent reminder of what we are on the verge of losing, but do so in a way that eschews urgency and panic in favour of sheer radiance and effusive joy.     The staggering range is impressive; Simpson and company's ability to conjure such affect no matter the mood doubly so. ""Break Up"" features gently fluttering electronics recalling a frozen lake cracking under the heat of the spring thaw, leaving a pool of melted psychedelia behind. Lead single  ""Ok Indicts""  follows a straightforward folk rock pattern that takes the point of view of the Ok Glacier in Iceland, which was declared dead in 2014 due to climate change, each scathing stanza another blow: ""Skin departing bone, ice abandons snow""; ""I saved your mistakes, etched them into my skin""; ""Sweating bits of time, leaking pools of kind""; ""Foiled by indifference, melted by greed / Please don't mourn for me.""    Even during the plainest musical moments, like on funereal acoustic tracks like ""Failure of Melting"" and ""The Wake,"" Simpson's words still sting. On the former, based on the true story of a lake in the Northwest Territories that fell off a cliff due to melting permafrost: ""The frozen sighed and gave up / The lake wrote a letter of resignation."" The latter begins by paraphrasing Gord Downie, and later features the particularly resonant lyric ""I wish I'd held you when you died.""    The album's massive centrepiece, a cover of  Willie Dunn 's ""I Pity the Country"" so aching and inescapable that it's practically slowcore, is towering and heartrending. Under the weight of so many factors — climate change threatening the land Indigenous people have sworn to protect; the prevailing necessity of movements such as Idle No More, the Unist'ot'en Camp and 1492 Land Back Lane; the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls epidemic; boil water advisories, public health crises and police brutality disproportionately affecting Indigenous communities — Dunn's words remain just as potent as they did upon the song's initial release in 1971, and Simpson's delivery filled with just as much fire. As they are on the rest of the album, her deliveries are matched by the band's arrangements, as a buzzing wave of guitars and crash cymbals burst forth like water from a broken dam.    Drawing on her 2020 book  Noopiming: The Cure for White Ladies , a fictional narrative driven by Anishinaabe literary traditions (of which several poems were adapted for  Theory of Ice ), Simpson also effortlessly weaves times together in a matter that is not timeless, but that flatten centuries of history, where modern vices sit neatly with centuries-old rituals, furthering the album's deep, contemporary resonance. As she explains on ""Viscosity"" in smoky spoken word, with consonants sharp enough to pierce holes through hundreds of years of colonialism: ""Tethered to the kinship of disassociated zeroes and ones / Shining your crown of neoliberal likes / Yelling the loudest in the empty room / Gathering followers like berries."" But instead of opting for soapbox social media shaming, Simpson instead spends the second half of the song articulating a powerful cure, speaking in contrast to ethereal background singing: ""At the beach, we build a fire / Sit in our own silence / Peel off blue light / Lie back on frozen waves."" It's recalled again in closer ""Head of the Lake,"" in which Simpson recalls a celebration with loved ones: ""We made a circle and it helped / The smoke did the things we couldn't / Singing broke open hearts / I hold your hand without touching it.""    The way that the album charts a path forward is perhaps its most powerful element. Where so many musical and artistic interpretations of today's precarious times and the centuries of toxic, colonial thought that led us here are filled with unending grief, sorrow and frustration,  Theory of Ice  is brimming with hope. The album practices what it preaches, showcasing the power of slowing down and honing in on life's tiny, beautiful details. As Simpson and  John K. Samson  sing in hushed unison on gorgeous duet ""Surface Tension,"" ""These are simple stolen moments / And we love when we are able.""    Over eight songs and 32 minutes,  Theory of Ice  demolishes the lines between poetry and music, folk and rock, electric and acoustic, past and present. The album transposes Simpson's lifetime of work keeping Anishinaabe literary and ecological traditions alive into yet another powerful form.  Theory of Ice  is gorgeous and heartbreaking, challenging listeners' relationships with the ground they stand on and encouraging them to slow down, breathe, look, listen, learn and move forward from there.

2021-03-10,Chris Ayers,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Eyehategod Give Their Sloppy Sludge a Squeaky Clean Makeover on 'A History of Nomadic Behavior',,"New Orleans misanthropes  Eyehategod  have passed the 30-year milestone of making the most deranged and influential doom metal, though it has come with a cost. Founding drummer Joey LaCaze passed away in 2013, and longtime lead guitarist Brian Patton stepped away from the band in 2018. After decades of hard living, vocalist and acid-tongued frontman Mike IX Williams suffered liver failure and underwent a transplant. Drummer Aaron Hill and bassist Gary Mader (Outlaw Order, Hawg Jaw) round out the current line-up and strengthen these quinquagenarians to an incredible degree, as heard on their previous album, 2014's  self-titled masterstroke .    At first listen, their sixth full-length,  A History of Nomadic Behavior , is difficult to swallow, as it jumps the rails a bit into new territory for the veteran band. ""Built Beneath the Lies"" is the ideal cross-section of what makes Eyehategod a perennial favourite amongst sludge fans, though even this brawny album opener has some chords in its midsection that sound almost happy. The buoyant nature of ""The Trial of Johnny Cancer"" resembles Clutch writing a Fluf-like pop-punk anthem. The weird near-jazz of ""Smoker's Place"" could be the soundtrack for a brief scene of redemption in an otherwise hopeless B-movie.    The rest of the album, however, is the signature sludge that the band has been slinging for an entire generation. ""Fake What's Yours"" sports guitarist Jimmy Bower's usual chromatic-staircase riffs, and ""The Outer Banks"" double-times the pace, as if doing donuts in a stolen car in the parking lot of a looted pharmacy. By the time ""High Risk Trigger"" emerges from the feedback haze of ""Current Situation,"" amid the classic riffs (surely lifted from 1993's  Take as Needed for Pain ) and slo-mo blastbeats, Williams' expertly tortured vocals show slightly less anguish as in previous years.    Overall, the album's production is too polished, which somewhat contradicts the band's filth-caked persona. Instead of their lovable, sloppy sludge with festering warts and all,  Nomadic Behavior  is squeaky clean and coherent, with a surgical gravity to each and every downtuned chord. Using a  Star Wars  analogy, if 2014's Eyehategod comeback album is  The Force Awakens , then  A History of Nomadic Behavior  is  The Last Jedi : it contains enough traditional elements to appease the older fans and delight the newer ones, yet its sonic oddities remain to confound the chaos.

2021-03-11,Sarah Bea Milner,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Serena Ryder Puts a Feel-Good Spin on Serious Themes on 'The Art of Falling Apart',,"Serena Ryder is indeed ""Better Now."" Her  The Art of Falling Apart  is a retro-inspired pop testament to the artist's personal wellness journey, chronicling her struggles with mental illness and subverting expectations by celebrating her newfound sobriety with danceable, up-tempo tracks. The music is catchy and vibrant, and Ryder's vocals are alternatingly soulful, moody and joyous.  The Art of Falling Apart  will delight existing fans, and is a strong entry in the singer-songwriter's discography.     The Art of Falling Apart  is a stylistic departure for Ryder — a pop album that dabbles in various genres, alternating between R&B, blues, funk and adult contemporary. Fresh and exciting moments are sprinkled throughout this daring album, which gleefully pushes the boundaries of genre convention. Ryder has demonstrated an appreciation for blues in the past, and in many ways,  The Art of Falling Apart  feels like a natural progression.    While  The Art of Falling Apart  is a new direction for Ryder, in general, the inclusion of soul elements in electropop music is a distinctly familiar vibe that never transcends its influences. Ryder has the chops to be a real blues and jazz powerhouse, and her sultry performances are a highlight of  The Art of Falling Apart ; it's a shame so much of her talent is being overshadowed by so much noise. The lyrics seem designed to be memorable rather than poignant; ""Candy"" is particularly vapid, seemingly by design. ""Waterfall"" and ""Kid Gloves"" aren't much better, each repeating a simple single metaphor that vaguely hints at some sort of adversity, while being too generic to resonate.    Despite some missteps,  The Art of Falling Apart  is a thoroughly enjoyable album. ""Better Now"" is the clear standout track, and its strength elevates the entire album. Ryder is at her best here: her crisp vocals cut through the instrumentation and hit home. More than any other track on  The Art of Falling Apart , ""Better Now"" packs an emotional punch, and has the pure Top 40 appeal to remind listeners of the passion and talent that made Serena Ryder a big name.

It's an unassuming little planet with a quiet, complicated pull; the Greeks deemed it the planet of the mind, a nervous messenger that reveals itself only as the light begins to fade. It's also the ruling planet of Virgo, the sign of the meticulous and single-minded, and its influence is felt all over  Sixteenth Sapphire , the spidery debut EP from Winnipeg trio  Virgo Rising .     Vocalist and guitarist Emily Sinclair and multi-instrumentalists Lauren and Jenna Wittman make quietly confident, interior music — knotty and intricate but never belaboured, their songwriting feels less like a diary than it does a brain-scan, a complex web of light put to tape. Across six tracks of bait-and-switch guitar music,  Sixteenth Sapphire  finds a place between Slint and the Breeders circa  Pod ; spindly, cerebral rock equal parts pretty and primal. Sinclair's lyrics are aching and clever, funny asides and sly subversions of the mundane that are as skillfully constructed and deeply felt as the trio's playing.    ""Goat-Footed"" lays out the band's MO from jump, building 30 seconds of spritely energy before popping it with a pin, all the pressure pouring into a swaying ballad. This game of tension and release reveals a band with a beyond-their-years sense of restraint and musicality, though their tendency to cut momentum almost threatens to pull the song under. The trio usually work best at a quick pace, when their knotty guitar work and mercurial melodies take centre stage, and some tracks — ""Goat-Footed"" included — are most thrilling at their tightest and fiercest.    The same can't be said for the gorgeous ""Molly Ringwald Dances in the Front Row"" which comes alive when the band breaks free a minute-and-a-half in only to top itself with a gentle coda of swirling voices and silvery atmosphere. ""Headlights"" mesmerizes at its stately pace, a glowering wonder that roils with organ and Jenna Wittmann's keening violin, while the gentle ""Juice"" moves like a nervous heart-beat; you can nearly feel Sinclair's face flush and pulse quicken as she rattles off the small secrets of falling head over heels. The band cover plenty of ground, folding an array of sounds — from the brooding psychedelic melt of ""Sleep in Yr Jeans"" to the post-rock churn of ""Headlights"" — into their spectral, wiry style.    Closer ""Back of a Head, Body of a Couch"" is the EP's crowning jewel, a series of dream-like vignettes that crests into a coda of warbling organ and lacerating guitar, like a shaggy descendent of PJ Harvey's legendary  To Bring You My Love .  Sixteenth Sapphire  feels like only a glimpse of what's to come from Virgo Rising, a work that promises as much as it impresses — imagine what they could do with more time, more space, more sound. For now, it stands as a more than worthy showcase, an introduction to their shadowy little planet.  ( House of Wonders )                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   EP   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Virgo Rising",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/virgo_rising_sixteenth_sapphire_ep_album_review

Rather, they feel like anything-goes dispatches from the Calgary songwriter/producer/illustrator's workshop, where no idea is too strange and nearly anything can be used as a musical instrument.     World's Most Stressed Out Gardener , his first official album since 2017 (not including a few oddments released on Bandcamp) feels a bit like half a dozen albums in one. There are creeping krautrock grooves (""Starlight,"" ""Inner Fire""), ramshackle nursery rhymes (""Samurai Sword,"" ""Spider Milk,"" ""Golden Pear""), straight-up rockers (""Nightwaves,"" ""Nightmare Scenario""), and a jarring neoclassical finale of sawing strings that sound like the  Psycho  score only fun (""Water Brother""). ""Nothing Is Strange"" sounds suspiciously like the vocals are run through that wobbly voice filter on TikTok.

2021-03-15,Tom Beedham,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Vallens Continue Their Lynchian Worship on 'In Era',,"A crisis of identity has arguably haunted  Vallens  from their early days, so it makes sense they'd mostly step back from the guitars on this sophomore effort. Robyn Phillips was already reluctant and cautious in validating media evaluations that had the band pinned as a shoegaze act in press ahead of releasing debut album  Consent  in 2016, and half a year later they were showing off a hungrier, more corrosive version of their sound.    So when Phillips coos a line like, ""Nothing like a new pain / Nothing like that old flame,"" over ethereal keyboard swells near the top of  In Era 's opening, titular track, we might rightly interpret it as a new guiding philosophy. By the end of the song she's inverting the lines: ""Nothing like a new flame / Nothing like that old pain."" Phillips's modernism is undeniable, but change also threatens the protagonist's representation. At the centre of the track, Phillips's narrator is offered a dance, but as they cycle through flames and pains, they get lost in the crowd invoked in the track's first line, dancing only with their anxieties.    If ""In Era"" conveys a preoccupation with the prospect of change, the album that shares its name is an attempt not just to navigate an overwhelming, accelerated culture, but to contribute something new to one. For Vallens, that means throwing out the drawing board; if Phillips was already turning phrases like ""time will devour"" on  Consent , now it's an ethos that pushes the project to a constantly shifting aesthetic approach.    With Phillips having logged two years of piano lessons after Vallens released their  Dimmed in My Display  EP in 2018,  In Era  is guided more by keys and electronic production, pushing the band to some fascinating studies in atmosphere and unnerving, mercurial shifts, often spending the better half of a track building up a vibe before making an abrupt pivot at the climax. On ""If I Don't,"" the band follows the still pulse of a phone toll into the loose swing of a trip hop beat before turning on a dime into a gallop that sets everything in motion; ""Difference Repeating"" is an ice palace of digital beats and chilly muted guitar notes, Phillips's voice gliding over all before everything gets scrambled like it transported to the Black Lodge waiting room, words converted to texture or concrete poems. They hang these left turns so often the unpredictability almost risks losing its novelty, but by the time we reach ""Come Home"" and its blown out, sludgy groove gives way to a guitar solo that sets everything ablaze, it still doesn't lose any of its heaving velocity.    It's not all new all the time, though; Phillips is building out a Vallens universe, and  In Era  is full of Lynchian twins: ""Old Flame"" explores alternative uses for a line from ""In Era""; the penultimate instrumental ""Opaque Undertow"" gets its title from a line in ""Sheer""; on ""Ingrid,"" Phillips sighs through a tribute to Ingrid Bergman, mother to Isabella Rossellini (a.k.a. Dorothy Vallens, the  Blue Velvet  character the project takes its name from); ""While You Are Still Waiting"" offers a sequel of sorts to  Consent 's ""While You Wait""; and ""Sin So Vain"" gives  Consent 's seven-minute epic of the same name a more condensed rearrangement that's actually less tense and more sun-dappled.

2021-03-16,Kyle Mullin,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC,POP AND ROCK",Daniel Lanois Expands His Signature Sound with Old-School Gospel on 'Heavy Sun',,"Heavy Sun ,  Daniel Lanois ' new LP, will have you proclaiming ""Hallelujah!"" Chalk that up, in part, to Johnny Shepherd, who not so much sings as preaches and testifies most of the album's vocals. All the while, Shepherd's shrill organ riffs could galvanize any congregation to their feet. It's certainly a different tone than the hazily haunting production Lanois famously offered U2, Bob Dylan, and fellow Canuck Neil Young.    That means casual fans familiar with the Hull, QC-born legend's work behind the boards will be surprised by ""Please Don't Try."" A prime example of what sets this LP apart from the mainstream Lanois oeuvre, ""Please Don't Try"" finds Shepherd's organ purring in contentment as he belts out one devoted-love proclamation after the other. The song climaxes with gorgeous harmonies between Shepherd, Lanois, guitarist Rocco DeLuca, and bassist Jim Wilson. ""Tumbling Stone"" takes those qualities even further. Lanois and his other bandmates provide a simple vocal bedrock, from which Shepherd's bellowing ad-libs lift off and soar. And on closing numbers ""Mother's Eyes"" and ""Out of Sight,"" the entire band shares the vocal spotlight, harmonizing together like old friends, though occasional wails from Shepherd pepper the proceedings with aplomb.    ""(Under The) Heavy Sun"" marks a stark departure from such sparse fare. Its opening synths and drum loops, along with samples of moaning vocals, all evoke the experimental classics Lanois made with mentor Brian Eno. However, the album's hallmark harmonies take over before long, morphing the song from ambient and abstract to a sparser, church choir tone in keeping with much of the rest of  Heavy Sun . ""Every Nation"" however, is laden with the enough studio trickery — from reverb to pre-programmed drums — to make it sound like an outtake from U2's Lanois-produced  All That You Can't Leave Behind  sessions.    Beautiful as these less lo-fi tracks are, they're better suited for a different, effects-driven project. What instead makes  Heavy Sun  memorable are Lanois' exercises in restraint, like the pretty harmonies with his bandmates and the space ceded to Shepherd's vocal-organ one-two-punch. That point is all the more meaningful for anyone who caught  Lanois' recent  WTF  podcast appearance . On it, he told host Marc Maron about both being raised on organ-rife gospel, and his early studio sessions with vocal quartets touring Ontario.    Regardless, this album reveals that Lanois is as gifted a collaborator and curator of talent as he is a creator of atmospheric productions for megastars. Let's hope the pandemic lockdowns lift soon, because Lanois and his bandmates deserve to delight audiences with their crackling chemistry and old-school gospel songcraft, all of which are vividly captured on  Heavy Sun .

2021-03-16,Eric Hill,8,"REVIEWS,MODERN COMPOSITION,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,ALBUM,MUSIC",Bell Orchestre Reboot Their Avant-Garde Explorations on 'House Music',,"In many ways,  House Music  feels like a  Bell Orchestre  reboot. Having started informally in the early '00s as a loose group of musicians who occasionally provided score for various friends' art projects, it wasn't until 2003 when they had reached a point of cohesion they undertook the recording of their first album. But then something quite momentous happened. That something was, of course,  Arcade Fire . And since that quickly ascending project shared  Richard Reed Parry  and  Sarah Neufeld  with Bell Orchestre, the band was more or less put on pause.    The 2003 debut,  Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light , was finally released in 2005 by Rough Trade. Though it and their John McEntire-produced follow up  As Seen Through Windows  in 2009 were both fairly well-received, the group's profile benefited and suffered critical qualifications as either being a postscript to Arcade Fire or junior partners in Montreal's burgeoning post-rock scene featuring groups like Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Silver Mt. Zion at the peak of their powers.    After a little more than a decade apart, with members Pietro Amato and Stefan Schneider concentrating on  the Luyas  and  Michael Feuerstack  releasing a steady flow of albums as  Snailhouse  and eventually under his own name, they reconvened for a two-week getaway at Neufeld's home in Vermont. What is now  House Music  emerged from improvised group sessions that were recorded live and edited into one continuous piece of music split into 10 movements.    The musical catalyst for the project is a rhythmic loop that Parry brought with him and plays on upright bass in the throat-clearing ""I: Opening,"" carrying through to ""II: House,"" eventually reappearing like a touchstone in later sections. Neither exactly funky nor mechanical, the loop still calls to mind the pulse that runs through Miles Davis's  Bitches Brew  and the motorik beat that runs through the Krautrock of the '70s, enhanced by Schneider's inventive drumming. The space within the house is conveyed by Feuerstack's drifting pedal steel and Amato's French horn alongside Kaveh Nabatian's trumpet.    Neufeld's violin eventually takes the lead with a slashing middle-European meets Quebec folklorique intro to ""III: Dark Steel."" She eventually sinks back into a wash of sounds generated by keyboards and electronics that mutate and enfold the organic sounds, setting up for ""V: Movement,"" the album's centrepiece and strongest point. It features a return of the bass loop and the most direct statement of something like a cohesive theme nimbly passed from pedal steel to trumpet to violin and back again. The aftershock of these strong and graceful moments is felt through the next three pieces like ripples from a momentous splash.    The album resolves with something like sunset, dusk, then full dark as the percussive elements fall away and let the remaining instruments flow over each other in long liquid lines. You almost expect crickets after Neufeld's violin slides into silence at the end. It is a masterful experiment, full of rich details delivered by a sextet of artists who are not only top-flight players but excellent listeners and re-listeners.  ( Erased Tapes )                           REVIEWS   MODERN COMPOSITION   IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Bell Orchestre",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/bell_orchestre_house_music_album_review
2021-03-17,Mark Dunn,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",'The Willie Dunn Anthology' Restores an Important Missing Chapter of Contemporary Folk Music,,"With the release of  Creation Never Sleeps, Creation Never Dies: The Willie Dunn Anthology , an important missing chapter of contemporary folk music has been restored. Apart from three songs released on 2014's  Native North America (Vol. 1)  compilation, and  Metallic , a later album of mostly re-released earlier songs,  Willie Dunn 's music has been difficult to find. He is in good company in the absent-but-remembered league of artists with vast catalogues of folk music, especially by Indigenous songwriters like David Campbell, Alanis Obomsawin and the late Shingoose, nearly silenced in the digital shift.     A filmmaker, songwriter, and politician who ran for the New Democratic Party, Dunn was central to the North American folk scene throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The arrangements are sparse, featuring acoustic instruments and Dunn's sonorous voice over folk and country sounds. Often, Dunn delivers his lines with a subtle rising inflection as if posing a question. The effect is one of constant inquiry. Although the music is calm and gentle, it is not passive.    Over the 22 songs included on  Creation Never Sleeps, Creation Never Dies , Dunn is fully engaged with the history of Indigenous people and the ongoing interruption of European presence on Turtle Island. Of Mi'kmaq and Scottish heritage, Dunn's scope is broad, recalling how the cultural disruption of the continent began and pointing out how the programs of assimilation continue into the present, while also celebrating the legacies of influential Indigenous leaders including Crowfoot, Crazy Horse, Louis Riel and Pontiac.    Dunn's most famous song, ""I Pity the Country,"" is an indictment of western governmental and religious structures that exclude and criminalize people based on heritage and economic status. The song — which is also enjoying new life thanks to a  recent cover by Leanne Betasamosake Simpson  — is an anthem in folk music circles and should be on the curriculum of social studies classes across the country alongside his version of ""O Canada!"" Canada's national anthem, according to Dunn, leaves out a few key details. Accompanying Dunn's spoken word rendition, a single nylon string guitar opens the piece with the imperial anthem ""God Save the Queen"" before morphing into the colonial melody. As if delivering a eulogy, Dunn twists the familiar phrases of Robert Stanley Weir's lyrics to acknowledge a land inhabited for ""one hundred thousand years."" In this version, the history of Canada doesn't begin with Confederation but stretches back throughout time to the very beginnings of the human experience. Dunn's treatment trades ""glowing hearts"" for hearts ""saddened"" from witnessing the land ""robbed and stripped"" by colonial expansion. Forests are levelled, and the First Peoples are ""shunted aside to the jails and the penitentiaries."" The anthem now grieves a Canada that was "" once  glorious and free.""     One of the long-lost gems in the collection is the song ""Charlie."" Decades before Gord Downie first learned about the story of Chanie Wenjack, which served as the inspiration for Downie's 2016 album  Secret Path , Dunn sang about the 12-year old who died of hypothermia after escaping residential school. In ""Charlie,"" Dunn imagines young Wenjack, lost, ""lonely as a single star in the skies above,"" plodding along the snow-choked rail line toward home. The song fades with Charlie still on his eternal journey to recover a life torn away by church and state. It's a journey that many have walked and continue to walk.    This could be the perfect time for Dunn's body of work to reenter public consciousness. The gulf between the privileged classes and the desperate masses has never been greater. With more people becoming aware of social inequities and government-sanctioned discrimination, Dunn's music is a hard shot of truth to awaken a world in slumber.

2021-03-17,Chris Middleton,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Dani Nash Stands Up from the Drum Kit on Self-Titled Debut,,"Dani Nash 's self-titled album is an incredible debut from a dependable member of Toronto's queer music scene. After 10 years of hiding behind a kick, it's nice to see one of Canada's most highly sought-after drummers — backing acts like July Talk, Andy Shauf and Sarah Harmer, to name a few — standing up from her stool and taking centre stage. While Nash flexes her multi-instrumentalist skills throughout the album, her abilities as a songwriter are rooted in her drumming abilities. The beat is the focal point of each of the songs, providing a solid base for each track to expand upon.    Nash really leans into a late-'70s/early-'80s new wave sound, very reminiscent of the Cars and Tears for Fears. While queerness isn't an overt thematic element in the music, the undertones run through her lyrics. It's less about the grand proclamations, and more about the nuances of the queer experience, which pop up on tracks like ""West Side."" Nash likes to explore the themes of loneliness, apparent in songs like ""Lady, Lover."" Through the mellowed-out smoothness of the instrumental, to the vocal tones she uses, she paints a picture of these scenarios. Standout track ""New Trend"" is an '80s sitcom theme song in the best possible way. Catchy guitar hooks, the airy piano, chorus harmonies and the way the sax hits at the end makes it sound like the end theme of a John Hughes movie.     The composition of this album is near perfect, as each of the tracks has been placed purposefully, and helps contribute to the package. It's noticeable with the first and last track in particular, with ""Get a Dog"" ending the album on a subdued note that slowly fades to silence. With themes of staying in and rearranging your records, it acts as a counterpoint to the bombastic, party intro that she sets up with ""When I Run.""    The album does veer into an edgier, more analogue-focused sound towards the middle, flexing Nash's versatility in genre. It keeps with the late-'70s vibe, but the tone varies into Nash opt for crunchy vocals and rougher guitar. While it seems a little jarring turn from the more synth-focused sound she brought earlier, Nash has transitional moments to pull listeners in and out of those moments.    The whole album feels familiar in a way, yet uniquely new. Nash's influences are apparent, but don't overwhelm the originality of the album. It's exciting to see such an accomplished musician showcase their art in such a triumphant way. Nash is going to have a hard time blending into the background after this album.

2021-03-17,Adam Feibel,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Harmony Woods Process Their Trauma with 'GRACEFUL RAGE',,"In the midst of a society-wide reckoning over the insidious dangers of casual misogyny and toxic masculinity,  Harmony Woods  have released a stunning album that intimately and poignantly encapsulates many of the abusive and manipulative behaviours that have prompted women to speak up and say that enough is enough. Led by singer-songwriter Sofia Verbilla, the Philadelphia band's third record,  GRACEFUL RAGE , is an impressive musical achievement built around a tangled account of the messy aftermath of a toxic relationship. In eight songs of resonant and emotionally potent indie rock, Verbilla and her group have assembled one of the most self-assured and consequential records of their scene.     Harmony Woods find themselves somewhere between the knotty indie-rock of Hop Along and Tigers Jaw, the emotive alt-folk of Lucy Dacus and Laura Stevenson, and the rousing, throat-shredding emo-punk of the Hotelier. With breakout act Bartees Strange in the producer's chair, the band's gritty guitars and pounding rhythms give way to airy, atmospheric sections with well-placed touches of cello, piano and trumpet — a dynamic sound that reflects the lyrical shifts between external ferocity and internal peace. It's a big step up for the band compared to their 2019 album,  Make Yourself at Home , which found Verbilla similarly trying to cope with toxicity and trauma but wasn't quite musically gripping enough to give her words their full power. Here, Verbilla returns to confront the complicated mix of guilt, shame and anger that remains; the songwriting is cuttingly honest and unforgiving, but even more importantly, the music rises to meet that intensity.    When Verbilla's voice soars at the 90-second mark of ""Good Luck Rd.,"" that's when the album first opens up to reveal itself as something special. The song's acoustic guitar and pounding toms bring to mind the ruminative sounds of Big Thief, and as it gathers more and more steam, we hear a band that intends to make a convincing artistic statement. ""You may not realize it yet, but I wish you the best,"" Verbilla sings. ""Yeah, everything's fucked… Good luck.""    While  GRACEFUL RAGE  doesn't speak directly to gender-based violence, it alludes to a pattern of harmful behaviours that make Verbilla and other women the subjects of manipulation, objectification and long-term emotional damage. Through heartbreaking vignettes, sharply pointed questions and searing indictments, Verbilla is vengeful yet sympathetic, often expressing cold contempt and reluctant compassion in the same breath. ""I should be mad at you for what you did / I'm mostly sad for you instead / But if you ever lay a finger on another girl again / You'll be dead to me / You make it so easy,"" she sings on ""Easy,"" a huge, towering song that makes dull pain and lasting resentment sound utterly triumphant.     ""You're screaming from an empty room / What will you do when no one's left to yell back at you?"" she asks in ""Holding You to You,"" a song built on dark, chugging power chords as she describes a perpetrator of entitlement, blame and gaslighting. The sneering pop-punk of ""God's Gift to Women"" is a series of sarcastic barbs that form a portrait of a narcissistic, faux-feminist, pseudointellectual fuckboy, while the upbeat rock and lively trumpets of ""Rittenhouse"" belie the seriousness of confronting a former partner about an unplanned pregnancy.     Verbilla won't give in to fully hating the person or people who have wronged her; instead, she lets the hatred melt into pity and saves that energy for herself. ""I'll keep my mouth shut, baby / Save it for the ones who love me,"" she muses on the title track. And finally, ""You will never hurt me again,"" she sings to the rafters at the colossal finale of ""I Can't,"" a power ballad that feels like a throwback to the days of Avril Lavigne and Goo Goo Dolls. Head held high,  GRACEFUL RAGE  is confident and tenacious. Throughout the record, Verbilla's voice is bright, clear and steady, whether she's contemplating quietly or crying out with all the air in her lungs. So much of Harmony Woods' strength derives from their willingness to do both — to process the trauma of the past and then let it out in a bloody torrent. Having the maturity to hold something back until those moments of all-out emotional purging makes just about every song on  GRACEFUL RAGE  its own journey toward absolution.

2021-03-01,Safiya Hopfe,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard Settle into Their Comfort Zone on 'L.W.',,"On  L.W. ,  King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard 's 17th studio album, the supreme rulers of the Gizzverse answer all of their own questions and follow all of their own rules, as per usual.    The prodigal psych-rock sextet have not had the outlet of touring over the last year due to COVID-19, leaving space for the band to ""reset"" according to a press release. The result? A frenetic exploration of apocalypse-induced madness and ecstasy, dispersed throughout 19 tracks and released as two separate albums. With electrifying tension,  K.G.  — released last November — continued the endeavour into Middle Eastern-inspired tuning and modified instrumentation which started with  Flying Microtonal Banana 's experimental dabblings in 2017. As a follow-up to  K.G. ,  L.W.  does more of the same.    This being said, it does not lack shifts and turns. ""If Not Now, Then When?"" boots off the record with a raucous stagger of drums and guitars, only to collapse into a steady lullaby prophesizing the end of days against an arcade-like backdrop. ""O.N.E."" offers a build-up in pacing as gradual as they come, and ""Supreme Ascendancy'' sees a meditation of sorts escalate into a whirlwind of uninhibited rhythmic intensity. The album is Gizz at their peak of prophetic paranoia. Sometimes soft, sometimes synthetic, and occasionally embracing metal (including, but not limited to, a literal MRI machine, drawbridge, chainsaw, and anvil)  L.W.  is a space-bound call to action that refuses to slow down.    As the band enters their second decade, it is worth wondering whether quantity could be traded for idiosyncrasy. Have the prolific trail blazers already done it all?  L.W.  is true to the textures and tricks which fans of the band have come to know and love them for. That being said,  L.W. 's ebbs and flows begin to dissolve into a musical landscape which, when looked at from afar, is less varied than ever. Their musical universe is one-of-a-kind, but  K.G.  and  L.W.  beg the question: have they gotten too comfortable there?    Perhaps repetition is a deliberate theme on these records, tied to the distinct laws of the space-time continuum on which the Gizzverse exists. Patterns abound here.  L.W.  closes with a sludgy, staticky, larger-than-life expansion of  K.G. 's opening track, ""K.G.L.W."" It is hard to argue with self-assuredness so well backed up by technical prowess and intensity.  L.W.  may not boast many surprises, but it cements its makers as masters of their realm.

2021-03-02,Manus Hopkins,9,"REVIEWS,METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,MUSIC",Brand of Sacrifice's 'Lifeblood' Is the Kick in the Ass Deathcore Needs,,"There's been an eerie, guttural rumbling in the deathcore scene since 2018 thanks to Toronto quintet  Brand of Sacrifice . Their interest-piquing debut album,  God Hand , saw them establish themselves as a band to keep an eye on, and landed them a slot on  the 2019 edition of the Summer Slaughter tour , headlined by the mighty Cattle Decapitation.    Any fan will understand how crucial a follow-up record is after a debut like Brand of Sacrifice's. The second album is always a tricky one, and the sophomore slump is a very real thing. Luckily for Brand of Sacrifice and their fans,  Lifeblood  is unquestionably the kick in the ass deathcore needs to thrive in the 2020s. Starting off with the agitated, tense, minute-and-a-half-long ""Dawn,"" the album moves into the smoldering ferocity of lead single ""Demon King."" ""Animal"" begins with a fraught yet calming piano and clean vocal-driven intro that lasts all of 20 seconds before the aggression is cranked up yet again, now incorporating classically tinged melodies.    Three songs in, the album already has already induced a massive bout of sensory overload, but it's far from over, and there is lots of musical and atmospheric ground left to cover. From the ambient, electronic-fused ""Altered Eyes,"" to the glitchy, futuristic ""Prophecy of the Falcon,"" to the soaring, operatic interlude that is ""Perfect World,"" there's an incredible amount of versatility here that is all too often left out of deathcore, making the genre feel tired and homogenous — and this is still only halfway through the album.    With 12 tracks of mostly bludgeoning deathcore, one might worry an album like  Lifeblood  might run out of steam before it's over, but this isn't the case thanks to Brand of Sacrifice's willingness to get strange. ""Mortal Vessel"" is shaped with ambient noise, ""Vengeance"" is driven by catchy riffs and an almost hip-hop groove, and ""Ruin"" is permeated by a dizzying technicality. After another short, calm-before-the-storm interlude in ""Corridor of Dreams,"" the album closes with its stomping title track, a culmination of everything that's come before it, and the only acceptable note on which to end the ruthless, barbaric sonic assault that is  Lifeblood .    Even deathcore's biggest critics should admit that Brand of Sacrifice have done something here. This is no typical deathcore album, and if there's any band that can dispel the criticism deathcore as a whole receives in elitist metal circles, it could easily be Brand of Sacrifice. This is the sound of extreme metal today, and  Lifeblood  is an album that deserves all the attention it can get.  (Blood Blast)                           REVIEWS   METAL AND HARDCORE   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Brand of Sacrifice",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/brand_of_sacrifice_lifeblood_album_review
2021-03-02,Daniel Sylvester,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Arab Strap Keep Listeners Guessing on Comeback Album 'As Days Get Dark',,"""I don't give a fuck about the past, the glory days gone by."" When it comes to Arab Strap, it seems like there's no other reasonable way to start off their comeback album. After a prolonged hiatus, the Scotlanders returned to the studio to create the aptly titled  As Days Get Dark ; their first LP since 2005's excellent send-off (and equally aptly titled)  The Last Romance .    Even before the turn of the millennium, Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton helped define the sound of '00s underground indie, from the post-rock pacing that would be also adopted by Mogwai to the tongue-twisting speak-sing of the Streets and the synth splendor of M83. So that's why, as the noughties revival starts to gear up, there's no better time for the duo to stage their return.    But despite the resistance Arab Strap seem to hold towards musical nostalgia, the pair are still keeping their audience guessing. Album opener ""The Turning of Our Bones"" features a pedestrian skeletal drum machine and uneven pacing, courtesy of Moffat's ""rapping"", while ""Another Clockwork Day"" delivers not much more than uninspired acoustic balladry. But as the album begins to ramp up with the twisting guitar and driving rhythm of ""Compersion Pt. 1,"" the band hit a mid-album stride with the immortal ""Kebabylon,"" a song so bursting with ideas and dynamics that it challenges ""The Long Sea"" and ""Girls of Summer"" for its pure grandiosity and brilliance.    From there,  As Days Get Dark  becomes a nearly flawless album, as the duo explore strident and rich synth sounds (""Tears on Tour""), Leonard Cohen-style lyrical directness (""I Was Once a Weak Man"") and pure sonic adventurousness (""Sleeper""). Although they brought producer Paul Savage (Mogwai, The Twilight Sad) back into the studio for their second consecutive LP,  As Days Get Dark  sounds substantially different than  The Last Romance , adding in wandering skronk saxophone, meaty four-on-the floor beats, stretched synths and swirling violins. This is all done by drenching these sounds with natural-sounding reverberations, helping Moffat and Middleton sound as interesting as they are moody.    For a band as hardboiled as Arab Strap,  As Days Get Dark  is nonetheless a love letter to the brave, ambitious nature the band has built their audience upon. The swings are bigger, the misses are broader, the hits are even more rewarding — for Arab Strap, there's no other reasonable way to approach it.

Daytona Bleach  is a punchy 7-song album featuring successful singles ""All or Nothing"" and ""RWLYD (Really Wanna Let You Down),"" the latter of which broke the radio record for highest charting song by an unsigned band on the Mediabase Canada Alternative Rock Chart. The band have remained incredibly busy between these two releases, including touring with Canadian icons Sloan and Marianas Trench, having their songs featured on television shows such as  Spinning Out  and  Northern Rescue , and winning the 2019 Jim Beam INDIE Award for Best Alternative Artist/Group of the Year.     Daytona Bleach  perfectly captures the charisma and energy that have contributed to the band's widespread commercial and popular success within Canada. From start to finish, the album is relentlessly upbeat, maintaining an energy level that never tips over into excess. It is not difficult to see how the band gained their reputation for lively, vibrant, vivacious live performances. Producer Ryan Worsley (Dear Rouge, Brave Shores) lends crisp production to the band's thunderously poppy, synth-laced songs, embedding Sally Shaar's punky voice at the centre of swirling instrumentals.     Each song is well-crafted and catchy, a testament to the band's productive chemistry with one another. The music and lyrics attest to a feeling of restlessness, of a desire to shout in the face of uncertainty and stillness. In ""I Don't Think About You,"" Shaar continually repeats the title over a frantic instrumental, unapologetically bragging that ""I don't think about you but I wanna know / How it feels to hear me on the radio."" She sounds confident and beguiling on danceable queer anthem ""He Said/She Said (I Wait),"" finding excitement in the anticipatory unknown.    MONOWHALES have never seemed interested in needless complexity or obfuscation in their music and lyrics (as Shaar sings in ""Out with the Old,"" ""Love equals sex / Sex makes you famous""), and this straightforwardness is part of their charm and appeal. Throughout  Daytona Bleach , it is clear that MONOWHALES know exactly what they want to say and how they want to say it, not wasting a single moment of the album on anything other than high-energy expressions of desire, frustration, exuberance and assertiveness.

From their 2008 self-titled record to 2017's  Spin  up until now, the Pennsylvanians have, over the course of 15 years, churned out easily more than an album's worth of consistently top-notch tunes. Whether it's due to quality or longevity, this is more than you can say about many of their modern emo peers.    For their sixth album, Tigers Jaw begin with one of the best songs they've ever written. Building from folksy acoustic verses into a big, powerful apex in a way that's reminiscent of early favourites ""Plane vs. Tank vs. Submarine"" and ""Never Saw It Coming,"" the opening title track of  I Won't Care How You Remember Me  suggests that the band has found its peak. But while the album is introduced with a grand statement, it fails to return to that high point, even on the strength of songs like ""Hesitation"" and ""Anniversary.""    Now a more tightly knit group than ever, the four members of Tigers Jaw have funnelled their songwriting efforts into looking at relationships with truth and clarity. Here, love only lasts as long as it comes naturally. If honesty means things come crumbling down, then so be it. ""A blue rose can't be mistaken,"" Ben Walsh sings in the high-powered heartbreak of ""Hesitation,"" a song about realizing the person you love is pulling away. ""If there was something I could do, it's not enough for you,"" sings Brianna Collins on ""Cat's Cradle,"" a high-flying, synth-led power-pop tune about a flamed-out friendship. ""Your body language tells me everything, because you won't tell me anything,"" Walsh gripes in ""Body Language."" ""If you wanted to ask for forgiveness, then commit and say it,"" Collins prods in ""Commit."" On ""Anniversary,"" they both conclude, ""We all fall apart in the same way."" These are common sentiments among anyone who's been in a failing or failed relationship — and it's well-trodden territory for Tigers Jaw — but age and maturity has given their songs the added quality of directness and a healthy amount of impatience. Get real or get going.    While the band lives in the present,  I Won't Care  also contains remnants of their past. Instrumentally, it's full of rhythmic staccatos and the distinct sound of Collins's electric organ, making the album sound a lot more like 2010's  Two Worlds  than you'd expect of a record made more than 10 years later by a mostly different group of people. (In 2013, three of the band's members left all at once.) ""Cat's Cradle"" is this album's answer to  Spin 's ""June,"" both of them being uncharacteristically sunny and cheery tunes that suffer from questionable track sequencing. ""Can't Wait Forever"" is not only a callback to the chorus of an early Tigers Jaw song, ""I Was Never Your Boyfriend,"" but it's also the latest installment in an obscure saga of friendly lyric-stealing involving them and fellow Scranton bands the Menzingers and Captain, We're Sinking.    Six albums in and two albums removed from their big member shakeup, it's fair to say that we know what Tigers Jaw are all about and what to expect from them. There wasn't a ton distinguishing  Spin  from 2014's  Charmer , and there's even less separating  I Won't Care from Spin . This record drags in its second half, as several of their records have now done, but there are some all-timers to add to their best-of playlist (along with their standalone single ""Warn Me,"" a phenomenal song not included here) and the rest is enjoyable enough. Tigers Jaw make albums that are good, sometimes very good, but not quite great.

2021-03-03,Alex Hudson,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,EP,MUSIC,POP AND ROCK",Alicia Clara Makes Her Mark as a Dream Pop Artist to Watch on 'Outsider/Unusual' EP,,"Swiss-born/Montreal based songwriter  Alicia Clara  makes gauzy, heavy-lidded dream pop — but, based on the sound of her six-song debut EP,  Outsider/Unusual , she could be almost anything she wants. ""Hazemaze"" bops along like a classic '60s pop tune, ""Stones Like Eyes"" pops and slaps with an undercurrent of swaggering funk, and  ""Five""  is a sighing gossamer ballad with forlorn lyrics.    Those distinctive moments are the highlights of the  Michael Kalman-produced   Outsider/Unusual , which is unfailingly lovely — so lovely, in fact, that not every moment makes a big impression. The shimmering guitar tones and reverb washes of mid-tempo numbers like the opening title track and ""Flowers Were Better"" are gorgeous; once the EP's 25-minute runtime is up, however, you'd be pressed to remember exactly what they sound like.     Outsider/Unusual  is a perfect start for a new artist. It shows that she's already got a handle on her signature sound, and it points the way for intriguing new threads she could follow on future releases. For anyone with even a passing interest in hazy dream pop, Alicia Clara is one to watch.

2021-03-04,Hayden Godfrey,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",POSTDATA Oozes Character and Individuality on 'Twin Flames',,"As the vocalist of  Wintersleep , Halifax's Paul Murphy has long been the centrepiece of energetic and thick rock songs. But, as the leader of the far more cerebral  POSTDATA , Murphy drops the showy bombast and embraces a more organic and reserved approach to production. On  Twin Flames , POSTDATA's third release, natural ambiance and demure lyricism take flight, creating an experience that is delightfully disorienting.     Despite the evident and accessible appeal of Murphy's songwriting, it's hard to pin down what exactly makes  Twin Flames  so special. Sure, it spans multiple genres — ""My Mind Won't"" features pulsating and cascading synths while the rhythm of ""Nobody Knows"" evokes distinct shades of George Michael's ""Faith"" — but there's something overarchingly purposeful about the arrangements. Almost every track is structured like a mini-journey, beginning modestly and eventually climaxing to a larger, more profound explosion of instrumentation. Deeper than that though, there is a decidedly relatable tone to most of the album's songs. Though they may be deceptively more expansive than typical pop, the arrangements are approachable enough as to not frighten unfamiliar audiences.     Even the album's title track, which begins rather dully, ascends to a generously seasoned plateau. In fact, the amount of complexity ingrained in the endings of most of the album's tracks can actually be rather stunning; when monotony is expected, the astonishing depth is made all the more poignant.     On ""Haunts"", Murphy dusts through clangy ambiance, a mysteriously splashy tonality that is revisited during the middle section of ""Yours."" Elsewhere, ""Kissing"" transcends typical pop structures and soars with acoustic drama, as does the lofty ""Inside Out."" Like Murphy's work with Wintersleep,  Twin Flames  reads like a pedestrian set of shallow love songs but sounds like a well-constructed, carefully layered fusion of diverse instrumentation.    Significant credit is due to the record's supporting cast, which bolsters Murphy's intimate vocal delivery and expression. Alongside him, Frightened Rabbit's Andy Monaghan and Wintersleep bandmate Tim D'Eon make appearances, contributing in a solid yet unobtrusive manner. Broadly,  Twin Flames  reaches for something more than the obvious, both musically and narratively. Guided by tiered mixes and honest lyricism, POSTDATA has, for all intents and purposes, succeeded in transporting any inclined ear to a place filled with imagination and whimsy. While it may occasionally wander in finicky obscurity, it nevertheless oozes character and individuality.

They are all about their blast beats contrasting against slow plodding riffs. With new album  Crime and Punishment  clocking in at only 13 minutes, there is surprisingly plenty on this record that requires listeners to come back to and contemplate. It's a heavy record that can be enjoyed on a multitude of levels.     It is hard not to draw a comparison to the band Nails —  Crime and Punishment  was produced by Nails drummer Taylor Young. The result is something more sonically punishing and dense from anything else in either band's catalogues. From a riff standpoint, everything is predicated on being as heavy as possible without completely sacrificing melody.  Crime and Punishment  is a record full of interesting riffs throughout, like on ""Absence"" and ""Concrete."" The best riff on the album belongs to album closer ""...And Punishment,"" which evokes feelings of complete dread.     The crux of what Regional Justice Center is can be found in Ian Shelton's lyrics. As is the case with most of the band's discography,  Crime and Punishment  is a concept album broken into two parts: the first half is about cause; the second, effect. Songs like ""Taught to Steal"" and ""Sickness on Display"" depict intimate stories of personal strife without burying the meaning of these songs in metaphor. Perhaps nothing is clearer than ""...And Punishment"" where the line ""Meant to thrive, left to die"" leaves very little to the imagination. Shelton's raw and strained vocal delivery adds much needed contrast against the band's bludgeoning riffs.    Regional Justice Center have been on a roll, and improving with each subsequent release.  Crime and Punishment  furthers Regional Justice Center's trajectory to being one of the best current hardcore bands out there, while also leaving plenty of room for experimentation. For a hardcore record that is all about heaviness and riffs, Regional Justice Center's  Crime and Punishment  delivers on all fronts.

2021-03-08,Matt Owczarz,8,"POP AND ROCK,PUNK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Montreal's DISHPIT Unleash Post-Punk Devastation on 'DIPSHIT',,"Following the sudden closure of their record label, Montreal-based  DISHPIT 's long-delayed debut album is finally seeing the light of day as the band begins working on the follow-up.  DIPSHIT  — recorded with veteran producer  Steve Albini  — unleashes a devastation of post-punk and lo-fi grunge upon the world.    While DISHPIT's roots are grounded in Canadian soil, they've gained quite the traction in the UK via various tours and festival slots — on their website, they mention being a Canadian band that's gotten air time on the BBC but not yet on the CBC. Between their foothold in the two international music scenes, they've managed to cultivate a niche following through songs that pair topics such as class struggle and female empowerment with kick-your-teeth-in energy and a playful attitude.     One of the standout elements is singer/guitarist Nora Kelly's versatile, occasionally shouted vocals, which cut through the chaotic and noisy instrumentation like a switchblade and demand you fork over your attention. Her inflection bounces from deadly serious (""Fix Your Life"") to guttural and snarling (""Trash Queen""); from uninhibitedly vulnerable (""This Time"") to tongue-in-cheque and absurd ( ""Plaza People"" ). Throughout, she captures moments of anger and fun and surgically walks the tightrope between the two.    The music behind the vocals is no less impressive or thrilling. ""Sold Out,"" ""1000 Ways to Die"" and ""Family Man"" soar because of gritty, frantic guitar and bass work on top of the extra tight percussion, creating a sonic battleground that'll certainly amp up a live audience. Even a slower number on the record, like the acoustic closer ""Get Rich or Die,"" carries a certain dark and moody edge to it, and, aside from maybe the throwaway instrumental track ""Splinter,"" it all works.    DISHPIT's ferocious and stellar-sounding first outing is a stepping stone in the right direction, deservedly setting the outfit up as a band to be on the lookout for.

2021-03-08,Kyle Mullin,8,"SOUL & FUNK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Valerie June Builds on R&B Traditions with 'The Moon and Stars: Prescriptions for Dreamers',,"An endorsement from legendary Stax Records singer Carla Thomas would be a dream come true for most musicians, but  Valerie June  attains much more than that. The Tennessee-bred rising soul star is backed up by that Queen of Memphis Soul on ""Call Me a Fool,"" a highlight from June's latest album,  The Moon and Stars: Prescriptions for Dreamers . No wonder Thomas was keen to pass the torch — June brays that song's chorus with rafter-shaking passion and brazen, open-wound vulnerability.    Much of the album features enough storied R&B, roots, gospel and soul motifs to instantly win over fans of those genre's classics. But  The Moon and Stars  is no retread. Just when June proves her bona fides, she quickly builds on the traditions that she has studied and drawn so much inspiration from. The result is a rivetingly unpredictable album. ""Stay"" is a prime example, thanks to its old-timey piano notes that lull listeners who will soon be jolted by hauntingly dissonant organ drones. Staccato marching drums and birdcall-evoking flutes then veer the track even further afield. Through it all, June's sweet coos anchor the song, and satisfyingly contrast with its more experimental flourishes.    ""You and I,"" meanwhile, boasts modern drum loops that sputter like a stone being skipped over a Deep South lake. A climactic psychedelic guitar solo, occasional whirring synths and June's soaring voice all amount to a microcosm for the album's overall eclecticism. And while the spare, downcast ""Stardust Scattering"" puts June's underrated lyricism at the fore (her lines about consciousness over the song's acoustic strums are especially compelling), ""Smile"" sits at the opposite end of the stylistic spectrum. Its swinging, upbeat rhythm, June's inspiring lyrics about resiliency, and her adlibbed ""ooh""s all make the song irresistibly catchy, while its old-school foundation and boundary-pushing elements also give this song the same timeless, mass-appeal quality that propelled Adele, Amy Winehouse and Feist to the top of the charts.    Aside from her distinctive singing and lyrics, and impeccable taste in backing band members, June is proving herself to be a strong producer, dividing the duties of the latter on  The Moon and Stars  with Jack Splash (Kendrick Lamar, Alicia Keys, John Legend). Here, her mix of convention defying and homages to her forebears give June the potential to not only be as successful as Splash's household-name collaborators, but also build on the storied legacy of Carla Thomas and her ilk.

2021-02-24,Max Heilman,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",Architects Tone Down Their Heaviness on Nuanced 'For Those That Wish to Exist',,"In a world where vocalist Sam Carter wishes he never yelled ""BLEGH"" before a djent breakdown, British stalwarts Architects have reached a dire strait. They defined a generation of techy metalcore with Linkin Park choruses, but the market they created is now oversaturated. The de facto leaders of post-metalcore can either branch out or tread water as their mountain becomes a plateau.  Architects ' ninth album,  For Those That Wish to Exist , has the unenviable task of navigating this career crossroads.    Two years after 2018's  Holy Hell   bounced back from the loss of  guitarist-songwriter Tom Searle  with emotional, impeccably executed metalcore, Architects revisit a more accessible sound akin to 2011's  The Here and Now . The band doesn't look back on that first attempt fondly, establishing  For Those That Wish to Exist  as a chance for redemption. To that effect, ""Black Lungs"" explodes into unapologetic nu metal riffs and shares some incredibly catchy hooks with its swelling balladic counterpart, ""Dead Butterflies."" In both cases, Carter stands out with a versatile range of resonant croons, sing-screaming and abrasive snarls.    ""Discourse Is Dead"" is the only cut that resembles Architects' usual heaviness, but this overall reduced aggression brings with it expanded instrumentation. ""Do You Dream of Armageddon"" introduces the album's tasteful blend of orchestral and electronic overtones. Layers of strings, brass and choir recur throughout the album, making the likes of ""Giving Blood"" a bombastic twist on  Minutes to Midnight -era Linkin Park. In the same way, ""Flight Without Feathers"" builds an electro-pop dreamscape on detailed keyboards and sampled beats.    An hour leaves a lot of margin for error, but the album's production values help deeper cuts like ""Demi God"" or ""Goliath"" remain interesting. The former achieves genuine immensity through its soaring string lines, while the latter's synth patches and ambiance bridge the gap between stadium-ready refrains (complete with Biffy Clyro vocalist Simon Neil) and Architects' metalcore roots.    Still, some passages needed more creative grit. ""Little Wonder"" is so streamlined and unthreatening that it actually embodies Carter's lyrics: ""I wanna sing you a different song / One that's easier to swallow."" It becomes a meta-narrative about palatable corporate messaging, brough full circle by the muscular triplet breakdown: ""They fucking had it coming."" This cut and ""Meteor"" aren't badly performed, but could've used compositional nuance to back up the big production and catchy melodies.    Angrier cuts offer more instances of Architects retaining creative vitality while stripping back the prog-metal. Drummer Dan Searle gives ""Animals"" a stomping, Rammstein-ish groove, ripe for some simple, addictive riffage from guitarists Josh Middleton and Adam Christianson, along with bassist Alex Dean. The song's four-on-the-floor rhythm carries over onto ""An Ordinary Extinction"" and ""Impermanence,"" in direct contrast to Searle's usual double-bass trickery. The latter finds  Parkway Drive 's Winston McCall at home within the metallic flourishes, packed with consistent, infectious intensity.    Whether it's the powerful, riffy ""Libertine"" or the delicate, lush closer ""Dying Is Absolutely Safe,"" Architects remain comfortable and self-assured within new environments. Other than a few lapses, the hooks, synths and classical instruments effectively recontextualize Architects' musicianship.  For Those That Wish to Exist  proves these guys can successfully diversify their sound.

What started out as a fun recording project during the early stages of the pandemic has fully morphed into one of the most exciting metal releases at the beginning of 2021. With influences ranging from Judas Priest to High on Fire, Grale's debut is a quick exploration of many aspects that comprise heavy music.  Grale 's  Agitacion  is giant celebration of the riff.    Everything about this release is generated through riffs. Whether it is the straightforward pummelling of ""Meth Aggressor"" or the dual guitar harmonies of ""Terror Control,"" riffs come in many varieties throughout in ways that dictate mood and melodic changes. This is never more prevalent than on ""No Justice for All,"" which sees groove-oriented rhythms turn into major key patterns, creating a disorienting emotional dynamic.    The EP's peak is ""The Blade,"" with its psychedelic stoner metal vibe bringing back fond memories of bands like Zoroaster. The song's high point is a dizzying guitar solo by guest musician Luke Roberts, whose melodic voicings are simply spot on for the moment.    Vocalist Daniel Allen, of Indian Handcrafts renown, has some stellar performances on this EP that provide needed melodic balance. With lyrical topics that explore concepts of self-immolation and personal strife, Dan's tonal quality is a perfect match. From the soaring chorus on ""No Justice for All"" to his rhythmic patterns on ""The Emptiness Project,"" his signature screechy voice pairs perfectly with the bludgeoning riffs throughout the record. An added bonus is all of the layering and ambiance his voice creates on songs like ""Meth Aggressor"" and ""Terror Control."" This extra nuance really help to create the overall atmosphere of the EP.     Agitacion  is a perfect length at five songs. It never wears out its welcome, nor does it ever linger on one idea for too long. Each track has a fairly simple setup, and yet its still just as enjoyable with repeat listens.  Agitacion  is an excellent look into the potential that Grale has going forward. Even if we never get another release from this collective,  Agitacion  is a formative release that encompass all that we love about heavy music.

It's an emotionally intelligent genre filled with self-deprecation and hard truths.  Kyle Edward Connolly  — the Toronto scenester known for his work with  WISH ,  Beliefs  and  Orville Peck  — is definitely not the first to blend indie rock and country music, but he may just be one of the best. With unique production and groovy melodies,  On Arrival  doesn't appropriate any traditional approach to country music, nor does it feel inherently contemporary. The album settles somewhere in between, capturing a timeless quality reminiscent of George Harrison or Gram Parsons.     On Arrival  is Connolly's personal reflection on a specific time in his life. The lyrics on each track often deal with personal issues of confusion and self-loathing, while the instrumentation often feels celebratory, and the juxtaposition greatly benefits the hazy, sun-soaked songs. It's that perfect blend of jubilance and sorrow that gives  On Arrival  a smooth flow and cohesive presentation.     The album   opens with the standout track ""Get Me Tomorrow."" Channeling the same country-rock swagger of David Berman, Connolly side-steps and riffs his way through catchy melodies and vulnerability. ""Could it be disillusion that's doin' me in like it is today / But I've heard the city's a hard place to be if you can't find your own way,"" he sings, with a laid-back,  c'est la vie  approach.      On Arrival  features two instrumental breaks, which work in tandem to showcase Connolly's musical intentions. The first is ""Passing Me By,"" an honest-to-God barn-burner that could get any honky-tonk crowd up and on their feet. The second, ""Coming Through,"" is a groovy slacker hit featuring synths, minimalist bass lines and an off-kilter drumming pattern. Though the two tracks couldn't be any more different, they don't feel out of place and get seamlessly incorporated into the album.    As  On Arrival  progresses, tinges of psychedelia appear, looser song structures form, and Connolly embraces his stream-of-consciousness lyrical style. On ""Drifting Away,"" Connolly sings, ""And here it comes, headed up now / Headed right for the beginning / And I could see it all so, so clear / Now you really had a hold on me."" Connolly lets his lyrics slip out without hesitation, demonstrating a remarkable sense of self-assuredness for a debut record.    Connolly may have some notable musical connections, but he doesn't rely on those to inform his own musical ventures.  On Arrival  is authentically unique in style and is the sound of an ambitious, talented artist doing exactly what they want.

2021-02-25,Alex Hudson,7,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC",Russell Louder's 'Humor' Is a Masterclass in Powerful Pop Vocals,,"Russell Louder  has been releasing singles since 2018, meaning that their debut full-length functions as something of an overview of the project's last few years. But even if  Humor  is a grab bag of past singles and new tracks, it mostly holds together as a cohesive statement, blending brash, thumping synthpop with belted vocals reminiscent of Florence + the Machine or Austra.    With throbbing dance rhythms and audacious synth patches, a lesser vocalist could easily get overpowered by these arrangements. Opener ""Home"" begins the album with buzzing bass octaves and a giant-sized keyboard riff that is initially reminiscent of industrial music — but instead of aggression, Russell's powerful presence pulls the track in the direction of pure dance pop.    The sets the tone for an album that's all about Russell's powerful singing. A press release notes that the Montreal-based artist was influenced by the the folk storytelling of their PEI upbringing — but even though these songs touch on themes like grief and self-identity,  Humor  largely conveys emotion through delivery rather than lyrics. ""Vow"" sets dreamy, melancholic melodies against an urgent dance pulse, while the deft delivery of ""Hello Stranger"" gives a sense of intimacy to its cathartic club rhythm.    The album takes a surprising turn in its last couple of tracks — ""Lavender"" combines rustic folk guitars with the usual synth textures, while abstract closer ""Go Now"" is a raw acoustic recording run through cavernous reverb. It's a curious finale, but it reaffirms what we now know about Russell Louder: that they're a vocalist with enough presence to make anything sound like their own.

It's a fair assessment of both the lives of touring musicians in general and Power's electronic odysseys in particular. Blanck Mass records are intense, energetic affairs, harnessing the most kinetic elements of EBM, industrial and noise to fuel songs that are expansive in structure and propulsive in tempo. Be it the bristling blitzkrieg of 2017's  World Eater  or the climactic trance drops of 2019's  Animated Violence Mild , Power's music often resembles some monstrous version of a perpetual motion machine.    So what does it sound like when that machine comes to a sudden and unexpected halt?  In Ferneaux  is a satisfying answer to that hypothetical. Made mostly during a period of COVID-imposed isolation, it consists of two tracks that hover around the 20-minute mark and run the gamut from placid drones to Merzbow-esque peals of paint-peeling static. Whether Power would've made such a record outside of the pandemic is impossible to know. Regardless of his motivation,  In Ferneaux  is a significant pivot, the moment when he takes his previously aggressive approach and sublimates it into something slower and more ethereal.    The result is a kind of aural travelogue — think the KLF's  Chill Out  without the pop samples or the exaggerated sense of humour. Both albums rely heavily on field recordings to establish a sense of setting. In Power's case, these snippets serve as both anchors and transitions, bringing the listener back down to Earth before transporting them somewhere new. Wind and waves offer a respite after the album's lone stretch of dance music, and birdsong diffuses a celestial synthesizer motif about 16 minutes through the first track.    For all its found sounds, though,  In Ferneaux  still bears Power's signatures, many of which take on new dimensions. Pitch-shifted vocal samples form the hook to many of his tracks, but here they feel off-kilter, scuttling across channels to eerie effect. When beats do appear, they're shrill and distorted compared to Power's usual earth-shaking low end. Abrasive at the best of times, his textures range from bruising to lacerating, with some passages echoing  Ravedeath, 1972 -era Tim Hecker. If the experience doesn't trigger Blanck Mass's usual adrenaline surges, at least it also skimps on the attendant exhaustion.     In Ferneaux  is everything most Blanck Mass albums are not: patient, subtle and disarmingly low-key. It was made in confinement, but it takes Power to surprising new places.

Van Slyke's latest is an enormous leap for the young artist. As the title hints, intentionally or not, the feelings on  Big Blue  are grand and melancholic.

Their desire to get lost is almost morbid on the slow-building, climactic title track: ""Let's just walk into the water / Become one with the blue."" The song crashes and recedes like water against a boat's hull. The sound of babbling water completes the illusion.    The title track also demonstrates Van Slyke's patience and optimism. ""There's a look in your eyes / Said just take your time / If you want it, you'll find it."" It's a good thing they possess these virtues —  Big Blue  is full of longing. ""I dreamed of the day when I could wake up and see your face,"" they sing on sparkling strummer ""Let You Know."" And later on ""510"": ""I think about you all the time / I think about you every night."" Van Slyke's voicemail vocals at the end of ""510"" create a sense of distance; their longing becomes that much more palpable.    Van Slyke also longs for the safety and security of mutual support, which they find on the unhurried ""Cathedral."" With Sydney Thorne on banjo and Peach Pit's Christopher Vanderkooy on slide guitar, the song lingers like the adoring gaze the narrator and their partner cast upon each other. On the drifting ""Landlocked Sailboat (The Colours),"" Van Slyke vows: ""I'll set myself on fire / To keep you warm.""      Big Blue  impresses with its musical sophistication and thematic cohesion. For the most part, Van Slyke sings in a hushed but clear voice that's never buried in the mix. With all this composure, the album never comes off melodramatic. When they display wisdom, their sentiments never feel beyond their years. ""I'll learn from watching your shadow surround me / That surviving is a form of art,"" they sing on ""A Story If You Want It."" And on the title track, they have the revelation, ""You can do so much healing with words."" Here's to more words, and whatever healing Kylie V needs, in their bright future.

2021-02-25,Matt Bobkin,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MODERN COMPOSITION,MUSIC",Nick Cave and Warren Ellis Find Beauty Amid Today's 'Carnage',,"Nick Cave  is sounding restless again. The legendary Australian musician had been sounding uncharacteristically pensive and reflective since kicking off a late-career renaissance with 2013's ominously baroque  Push the Sky Away , leading to some of the best albums of his career. But, even at his most placid, it sounded like Cave still had the power to leap out of listeners' headphones and bellow in their faces — he was just choosing not to, as on 2016's sparse, ambient  Skeleton Tree  and 2019's mournful, ornate  Ghosteen .    Now, it appears he's been forced to. Following months of mandatory, pandemic-induced downtime, Cave took a week-long studio sojourn with longtime  Bad Seed  and frequent film score collaborator  Warren Ellis , where the duo spat out  Carnage , eight gnarled tracks driven by an almost compulsive, desperate need to create, as if the musicians themselves would burst if they couldn't get their ideas onto tape. (Similar to its hurried creation,  the pair delivered the album as a surprise release .)  Carnage  hardly sounds rushed, though; Cave's vocals and Ellis' instrumentals — particularly in his work with  Dirty Three  — have always had raw, naturalistic qualities, and they're presented here in an honest, authentic way.    You can practically hear the pent-up tension in Cave's voice and Ellis' instruments after being sidelined for so long. As Cave sings in opening track ""Hand of God,"" ""I'm going to the river where the current rushes by / I'm gonna swim to the middle where the water is real high."" Ominous falsettos yelp the titular phrase over and over again, and Ellis' violin screeches above. ""Old Time"" has Cave returning to his grizzled  Grinderman  snarl, augmented by plonking keys, synth bass, warbling violins and roaring electric guitars — a fun and fresh way to revisit the Bad Seeds' high-octane recordings of old.    But, by and large,  Carnage  succeeds when it opts for beauty over devastation. Though Cave is still able to sell the confrontational, murderous rage of his 1996 adaptation of folk song ""Stagger Lee"" in live shows, a similar attempt to convey menacing spoken word here on ""White Elephant"" falls flat. He oscillates between incisive, topical commentary (""A protester kneels on the neck of a statue, the statue says, 'I can't breathe' / The protester says, 'Now you know how it feels' / And he kicks it into the sea""), bizarre word vomit (""I am a Botticelli Venus with a penis / Riding an enormous scalloped fan"") and limp musings like an AI trained on hours of Fox News (""The president has called in the Feds / I've been planning this for years / I'll shoot you in the fucking face""), before the whole ordeal is miraculously salvaged with a jubilant, Spiritualized-sized orchestral finale. Closer ""Balcony Man"" is similarly styled — the latter's refrain of ""This morning is amazing and so are you"" is so earnestly heartening, with instrumentation to match, it's enough to forgive attempts to rhyme ""tap dancing shoes"" with ""lap dancing shoes"" and extended references to Fred Astaire (which, of course, he rhymes with ""stairs"").     Carnage 's best moments occur when Cave and Ellis give in to peace and warmth. The late-album stretch of ""Albuquerque,"" ""Lavender Fields"" and ""Shattered Ground"" soars with magisterial pianos and strings, Cave channeling the operatic delicateness of  Ghosteen  without the compositional sprawl that bogged down the record. It's not to ignore the hard times, but to listen to and learn from them. ""I am travelling appallingly alone / On a singular road,"" Cave sings on ""Lavender Fields."" And later, ""People ask me how I've changed / I say it is a singular road.""  Carnage  is proof enough that it's true. And on ""Shattered Ground,"" he finds balance between madness and peace: ""I don't care what they are saying / They can scream their fucking faces blue again / I will be all alone when you are gone.""      Carnage  covers broader range than most of the Bad Seeds' recent records, cramming plenty of Cave's various stylings into a neat, eight-song package. For all of Cave's hunger and glee to return to the foreboding sounds of his past, it's when he opts for pure catharsis and bliss that he album achieves its full power.

2021-02-26,Vish Khanna,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC",Bob Dylan's '1970' Turns a Copyright Technicality into a Must-Hear Meeting with George Harrison,,"How big is  Bob Dylan 's basement and exactly how many more tapes has he got down there?    That's one of the intriguing questions this ""copyright extension"" three-CD set raises for fans clamouring for as much of the man's work as they can get and, for now, the stewards of his archives continue to oblige.    With tracks featuring  George Harrison  and culled from New York City sessions that took place March 3 to 5, May 1, June 1 to 5 and August 12 of the titular year,  1970  is a loose and revelatory glimpse of an artist trying to figure himself and some new songs out. The era in question eventually spawned the pleasant lark of sweet-voiced covers and originals that was  Self Portrait  and the more earnest (but still rather weird)  New Morning .    Initially released in limited quantities late in 2020 to avoid a copyright issue where recorded works enter the public domain after 50 years, this 1970 stuff wasn't likely ever meant for public consumption. Ostensibly rehearsal and workshop sessions to get Dylan and assorted players familiar with each other and some new works, the May 1 gathering gained infamy and interest because Harrison sat in on at least nine songs (though, not the scrappy version of the Beatles' ""Yesterday"" found here, which, who knows, maybe Dylan pulled Paul McCartney's most popular song out as a playful jab, since the band were breaking up badly over business fractures and all of the other Beatles weren't huge Paul fans at this point).    On vocals and guitar, Harrison's presence is not overtly perceptible to any but those who have studied his style closely; as was his wont, the Dark Horse simply melted into the background. Still, there's a lift in this version of ""One Too Many Mornings,"" or  Basement Tapes -style song explorations like ""All I Have to Do Is Dream"" by the Everly Brothers, whom Dylan and Harrison both admired. Surely the players in the room must've been altered, trying to do their jobs with these two icons in their midst, messing around with covers by Carl Perkins or reimagining Dylan songs. In another curio, Harrison does not appear on this collection's different takes of ""If Not for You,"" which he and Dylan actually exchanged; he recorded it for his own  All Things Must Pass  before Dylan did a version for  New Morning .    The ""supergroup"" implications notwithstanding, Harrison was just kind of there that day, quietly lending a helping hand as his Jedi training had taught him to do. For Dylan fans, this is more of a window into his process, much as some other iterations of his  Bootleg Series  have been. In fact, this may not fall under that umbrella (for some reason), but it's in the spirit of an ""official bootleg"" for sure, sequenced in such a way where the same song is presented in consecutive takes, marking its subtle and overt evolution.    There are some cool and very fun pieces here, like versions of Buffy Sainte-Marie's ""Universal Soldier,"" a rollicking and then more country-tinged ""Alligator Man"" by Jimmy C. Newman, and ""Jamaica Farewell"" as popularized by Harry Belafonte, but ultimately  1970  is not meant for us to puzzle over too much.    As usual, fascinating choices abound when a lost Bob Dylan session is unearthed (and, excitingly, signalling that maybe there's way more of this kind of stuff to come), but this one feels particularly prototypical and casual, and, with good humour, was intended to warm folks up — to each other and the material — more than get its hypothetical audience hot and bothered.

2021-02-26,Vish Khanna,8,"POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Neil Young and Crazy Horse Get Their Stage Legs Back on 'Way Down in the Rust Bucket',,"One of the finest rock bands ever, getting their stage legs back before a small audience in a club, ahead of an era-defining arena tour — what a glorious thing.    After releasing the acclaimed and influential  Ragged Glory  in the fall of 1990,  Neil Young , Ralph Molina, Billy Talbot and Frank ""Poncho"" Sampedro hunkered down together onto the small stage of the Catalyst club in Santa Cruz and casually blew everyone in attendance away. Captured here in startling audio and on DVD as a Bernard Shakey and L.A. Johnson custom job, grainy with the smoky haze of the club burned into the film stock, Crazy Horse sound huge and they dig into treats, both for us and for them.    Ostensibly a set debuting songs from  Ragged Glory  that have become legendary live staples, like ""Country Home,"" ""Love to Burn,"" ""Farmer John,"" ""Fuckin' Up"" and ""Love and Only Love,"" it's clear that virtually every album track kicks all ass in-person and get the band tripping on their own Horse juice in a thrilling manner. That's what happens here, particularly sitting with the record. The sound produced by these four dudes — instrumentally and in their vocal harmonizing — roars through the speakers like nothing else ever has.    Further distinguishing this release, Young felt compelled to dig through his catalogue for rare performances and debuts. ""Danger Bird"" had, remarkably, never been played live despite being a standout from 1975's  Zuma . 1981's relatively under-the-radar Crazy Horse record,  Re·ac·tor , was revisited for a spirited take on ""T-Bone"" and ""Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleaze,"" an angry tirade about yuppies. Along with  American Stars 'n Bars  pieces like ""Bite the Bullet"" and  ""Homegrown,"" all of this rarity must've been mind-melting to witness at the time.    Sure, every once in while somebody in the band fucks something up at their first show in a while but they do have a song about fucking up, so it makes total sense that they might do that and laugh it all off, like an inside joke we can all see. It's clear from listening to and watching  Way Down in the Rust Bucket  that this was a truly special occasion that now lives on, in this remarkable new document of Crazy Horse in all its (ragged) glory.

2021-03-01,Chris Bryson,9,"R&B,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Bernice's Subverted Pop Shines Brilliantly on 'Eau de Bonjourno',,"Bernice 's entrancing music holds no bounds — the Toronto-based group are keen to throw genre expectations to the wind, and ultimately for the best. Keeping things unexpected and askew are what Bernice excel at, and with their second LP,  Eau de Bonjourno , the follow-up to 2018's acclaimed  Puff LP: In the air without a shape , they prove there's no limit to the joy of the creative heart.    The brainchild of songwriter and musician Robin Dann, Bernice are rooted in expansive experimental pop that weaves elements of jazz, electro, R&B and soul into something simultaneously complex and playful, and utterly unique. Dann wrote  Eau de Bonjourno  with long-time collaborators Daniel Fortin (bass), Felicity Williams (vocals), Thom Gill (keys/guitar), and Philippe Melanson (e-percussion/drums), at a Toronto Islands artist centre. Between them, they've performed with Bahamas, Andy Shauf, Lido Pimienta, Beverly Glenn-Copeland and others, and their extensive CVs are apparent from the first song. Adding to the album's breadth, Bernice collaborated with acclaimed producer and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily, who's worked with artists like Iggy Pop, Elvis Costello, Lou Reed and John Zorn. For all its complexity,  Eau de Bonjourno  feels seamless and in the moment; the culmination of creative minds unafraid to take things in new directions.    The album's loose tracks are laced together with quirky yet perceptive lyrics through capricious, calculated shifts in mood and mode, like the jazzy galactic swagger of opener ""Groove Elation"" and ""Personal Bubble,"" which jaunts through a funhouse of weird rhythms and sounds before spiralling out on wavering sax blurts. Following along with similar dynamics, ""Empty Cup"" progresses as if Bernice are flying through Julia Holter's  Aviary , marked by twinkling bells and stars and twittering birds, until the band busts into liquid funk and one of the record's most danceable moments to carry the song out. The tinkling keys and shambling electronic beats of ""It's Me, Robin"" are paired with Dann's narrative intermittently questioning and affirming ""Who are you?"" amongst lines like: ""So clear today, what I need to convey, okay / It's so much less simple / To give yourself the same love you receive, believe in your inner value / Who are you?"" The song eventually wades into a shimmering sea of skipping drums, wafting sax and flittering instrumentals, with Dann repeating ""Who are you?"" with a sense of openness and revelation, like she's on the path to knowing.    One of the most striking things about Bernice's music is its ability to evoke a whimsical yet grounded feeling, both musically and lyrically, like with the dreamy, transient longing of ""Lone Swan"" and the sprawling and morphing effervescence of ""Big Mato,"" which features lyrics that turn salad (the ""bowl of creation"") into a humorous metaphor for intimate moments. ""Your Beautiful House"" also plays off these themes, with gleaming piano, subdued drums and static crackles and pops. Throughout the song, Dann says sorry for things like forgetting someone's name, the way to their house, and the day they met. Her words drift away like the memories she's apologizing for forgetting, but with a sense of acceptance in the air.     ""Infinite Love"" – like its name implies – skips, flutters and soars. But Dann tempers such a lofty ideal with personal truths, infusing experience and appreciation into lines that reflect reality and hope: ""Don't you know, heaven is a concept to outgrow / You can feel the weight of your body is the proof / When it hurts, channel the energy of open space / When it hurts, just look your beauty in the face."" With creating  Eau de Bonjourno , the rest of the band was welcomed into Dann's writing process for the first time, where the intent was to craft a batch of songs that spoke to each other and told a collective story. Between writing sessions, they would cook and skinny dip, and the levity of this creative circumstance underscores the album's 10 tracks. However, like fun times spent connecting with friends, notions of purpose, identity and personal discovery inevitably shine through.     At the heart of these songs is a creative freedom and delight that is as unmatched in its idiosyncratic style and experimentation as it is in the band's confidence to continually take things further. Subverting genre expectations and restructuring pop into imaginative new forms, Bernice continue to piece together and encapsulate gorgeously immersive and magical worlds with hidden gems, like the joys of life, just waiting to be found.

2021-03-01,Alisha Mughal,8,"POP AND ROCK,EP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",iskwē Swaps Out Electro-Pop Immediacy for Orchestral Haunt on 'The Stars' EP,,"You'd be wrong if you thought  iskwē 's  acākosīk   couldn't get better. If the Juno-nominated album can be likened to a beautifully destructive storm, then the new  The Stars  EP, an orchestral reimagining of the electro-pop album, is like a steadily persistent downpour. Maintaining the urgency of  acākosīk ,  The Stars  is a pared-down but endlessly nuanced sequel that puts iskwē's voice front and centre, making for a comforting but cathartic experience.     The Stars  contains a great many mystifying and satisfying contradictions. It seems effortlessly assembled but it's also grand and cinematic. Compared to the resounding energy of  acākosīk ,  The Stars  has been reined in, relying primarily on piano, cello and violin to support iskwē's vocals. Expertly arranged and pitch-perfect, the symphonic feel of  The Stars  is complicated and thereby made interesting by its intimacy: listening to the EP is like experiencing a casual, spur-of-the moment performance, so unmediated it is, so haphazardly perfect. Couched in the satiny strings and percussion, iskwē's voice contains its idiosyncratic alacrity, making for an overall atmosphere that's soothing but also bleeding.      The new ""Lovers Mix"" of ""Night Danger"" augments the original version's leathery and sexy ambience with the feel of fatal tragedy that only strings can. The violin on this track is, in turn, airy and spry, wailing and melodramatic. If the  acākosīk  version highlighted the delicious and lustfully dizzy aspect of falling in love, then this iteration focuses in on the knowing part of falling in love; it is tear-soaked and conveys the knowledge that everything can so easily, swiftly fall apart.     But the true star of  The Stars  is its version of ""The Unforgotten,"" which is a sublime showcase of the mighty force that is iskwē's voice in an EP that already shows us what a gem it is. A communal song reminding us of Canada's insidious racism, the original, Tanya Tagaq-featuring version is absolutely caustic, but  The Stars ' iteration takes on a soft, sombre urgency. The piano and violin come together in a curious but ultimately amazing way on this track: despite their mightiness, they hush as iskwē lets her inimitably strong vocals tell a story whose lessons the world needs to keep hearing.      This commingling of delicacy with dire knowingness undergirds  The Stars . That these tracks can exist outside of the industrial dressings of  acākosīk  — and stunningly, at that — is a testament to iskwē's triumph firstly as an artist, and secondly as a storyteller weaving tales with a soul, stories that are simultaneously old and new.

2021-02-18,Chris Bryson,7,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,EP,ALBUM,MUSIC",Blessed Lean Further Into Experimentation on 'iii' EP,,"Blessed 's edge is defined by energy and experimentation, of exploring new avenues just to see where they'll go. At the heart of the Abbotsford quartet's sprawling artful post-punk is a continuously evolving tension and release. Blessed's vocalist Drew Riekman says the songs on  iii , the follow-up EP to the band's dynamic 2019 debut LP,  Salt , reflect his experiences with anxiety, which he's often found a salve for in community and collaboration.  iii  takes anxiety's inborn tensions and remedies them with catharsis, collaboration and continuous change.    Blessed have taken a hip-hop style approach to the EP by having a different collaborator mix each song, including Corin Roddick of  Purity Ring  (""Sign""), John McEntire of  Tortoise  (""Structure""), and Graham Walsh of  Holy Fuck  (""Centre""). ""Sign"" opens  iii  with a brief intro of slow percussion, Riekman's airy tenor and a billowing drone. The song moves through crashes of guitar that flow into winding and chiming notes in a hypnotic, overcast sway. ""Structure"" fuses repetitive motifs with bouts of spiralling notes and jazzy drumming. The band ends the song with their signature serrated riffage and propulsive percussion that in the days of live shows would've had heads bobbing and bodies moving.    ""Centre"" rips through rugged bass, rapid-fire drums and razor-edged chugging riffs before shifting into electronic percussion and spacey notes. Vocals move from euphonic to chanting; ragged chugging turns into relentless angular tones, taking listeners to the unhinged circus that Blessed are so fond of frequenting. It's the back and forth and interweaving of the dreamy and frenetic, the melodic and noisy, the relaxed and tense, that mirrors anxiety in its not-so-subtle and unpredictable nature. Emotive and searching lyrics that flow like fragmented thoughts also add to this feeling.    But it's the way Blessed meld and play with these elements so seamlessly that makes them stand out. The Riekman-mixed closer ""Movement"" is the EP's slowest song and stylistic outlier. Its melodic melancholy wrapped in a blanket of buzzing drone, with Riekman's vocals sounding mixed into the atmosphere, as a simple rhythm keeps pace with subdued and sparkling keys and guitars.     With  iii , Blessed's strengths in mood, melody, complexity, experimentation and dynamics are complemented by the creative minds of collaborators whose individual styles add a unique flavour to the collection. As their first release for Flemish Eye, where they're labelmates with fellow post-punks Preoccupations, it's no doubt Blessed's controlled chaos and exploratory spirit will catch new ears.  iii  is a solid label debut from a band that seems intent on strengthening their toolkit while expanding their sonic landscape.

Whitney K 's  Two Years  shows the power of finding freedom through self-connection, teaching listeners how to fall back in love with oneself.    Opening track ""Good Morning"" starts with a low hum and scratchy whistle, gradually building and making its way to the climax, with Konner Whitney's raspy vocals recalling John Cale and Lou Reed. Rather than completely fading out, the song gently concludes, leaving with a sense of uncertainty, painting a picture of someone seeking change but either unready or unsure of where to start.     ""Me Or The Party #165"" is the album's most honest and open track, with lyrical gems such as ""The ladies all love you, the DJs dedicate the night to you / Fill your body up with cocaine, you've earned the right to"" and ""Tell me, who do you love? Me or the party?"" Meanwhile, ""The Weekend"" is centered around the journey of giving negativity the upper-hand before finding clarity in the beauty around you, while ""Last Night"" champions the little triumphs in life and letting go: ""Having it all doesn't mean all at once."" The pair, while beautiful on their own, are even more impactful in tandem.     The album concludes with ""Maryland,"" an uplifting and heartwarming tune. Whitney has taken listeners through his battle of finding self-love and is now ready to be loved by others, singing, ""She says she loves you / So take the money and let her love you / Ride providence as it begs to be rode / To Maryland and beyond."" Bookending ""Good Morning,"" ""Maryland"" marks an ending to Whitney's story, calling on himself to embrace the change.    On  Two Years , Whitney has used his vulnerability and courage to achieve solace. By using sly humour to power his resilience, he's found peace of mind in an open and honest retelling of his burdens.

2021-02-19,Vish Khanna,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Spencer Burton Keeps Hope Alive on 'Coyote',,"Miles away from his  Attack in Black  and  Grey Kingdom  days,  Spencer Burton  has decisively thrown his hat in the ring with  Coyote , vying to be one of contemporary country music's most significant and compelling songwriters.    A good-humoured soul, Burton is approaching mid-life at one of the worst times ever. Pandemics and ecological collapse have fostered a kind of nihilism that has eroded social decorum and communal courtesy and concern. Such things weigh on Burton so heavily, he does his best to focus on a time when life on Earth filled you with enough good warmness, the hard, negative chills couldn't quite get to you all the way.    Bolstered by lush production (Soaring backing vocals! Pedal steel guitar orchestration!) and forsaking any stylistic irony for substantive sincerity, Burton is seizing the day and going for broke. By and large, this dedication to his craft seems to be bolstered by a palpable gratitude Burton has for the family, friends, and fans that support him and help keep hope alive. A lot of this joy is measured in moments.    On ""Things I Can't Do"" and ""Hard Times,"" Burton seems to be singing about and to a specific subject, whose existence means he can exist; even the mundane stuff you get to do every day is supported by someone you're in a relationship with. Have five minutes to stare into the middle distance? Could be because someone else is sorting out dinner for you and the kids. There are a few instances here, such as ""Memories We Won't Soon Forget,"" where Burton's lyrics conjure that sentiment or serve as a direct testament to someone else, who emanates warm light in the darkness of life. The aforementioned tune cites a baby's first steps or early speech and also a first date and a wedding activity. It's not dad rock but this is definitely dad talk. He uses his songs to send signals of appreciation towards those who choose to not only carry on in hard times but share their life with someone else, which, when you think about it, takes a considerable amount of sacrifice. Burton is not oblivious to what makes a tandem bike roll.    Initially jarring, the radio-friendly drumbeat for ""Further"" makes the song sound deceptively sunny. Indeed, before long, Burton is talking to us like a gentler Travis Bickle, calling for the rain to wash away the less than appealing side of humanity. It's an urgent, anthemic song with dynamic dips and crescendos and female backing vocals, pushing Burton to emote with the biggest voice he's got.    Things calm down for the pedal steel-soaked ""Breath,"" which, again, contemplates a life measured by where it has been and what it has experienced. It suggests that our memories are more than just that; they are markers of something more profound — the things our minds have decided are the most noteworthy parts of our lives. How does the brain decide what's what? Burton seems to know it's actually the heart's call about what gets stored up in the attic, and what is deleted forever.    There are instances where Burton gets a bit self-aware about his folk/country medium, turning an analytic eye in its direction. ""Lonesome Dove"" conjures a bar scene where the subject is fostering a group connection (via booze) even as they feel no link to any individual soul. Though not some straight edge broadside about the glamourization of alcohol in song, as a soother for a broken heart, ""Lonesome Dove"" is subtle enough to sound like it's championing behaviour it's most likely scrutinizing, with a chorus pondering ""hard times,"" and other ways of dealing with them.    In other meta assertions, there is Burton's ""Human Touch."" A few years ago, Burton's old Attack in Black bandmate Daniel Romano raised a few eyebrows when he released a record called  Human Touch  as a limited edition download. Naming a record after one that is generally regarded as one half of Bruce Springsteen's greatest folly (the other was  Lucky Town , simultaneously released the same day; furthering the nod, Romano also released another album,  Nerveless , beside his own  Human Touch ) seemed funny and fascinating. For Burton to vaguely jump into this fray might seem like a part of some elaborate gag, but his song here is earnest and a lovely closer. Some of Burton's jokes are really sincere so we may never know whether Springsteen or Romano had anything to do with this song.    Spencer Burton retains his coy wit and wordplay for an album that is otherwise rather accessible and inviting. The insularity of this era — lockdowns notwithstanding — has led to great cynicism and detachment. With  Coyote , Burton isn't nostalgic for some other time but does long for the best things about those times to return and hopefully last forever.

After two critically lauded albums of raw, powerful alt-folk — as well as a rapturously received collaboration with Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus as  boygenius  — Memphis-based singer-songwriter  Julien Baker  has burst forth with a third effort that's so fully formed and viscerally human, it might as well have its own pulse.    Known for making music out of little more than a strong, crackling voice, the reverberations of an electric guitar and the most intimate moments of confession and self-reflection, Baker has now embraced a full-band sound that fills in the spaces where previously there were only breaths, cracks, creaks and palpable tension. The arrangements include drums, bass, synthesizers, piano, banjo and mandolin, with nearly all of it performed by Baker. It's a natural yet nonetheless daring next step for an artist of her kind, and she makes the transition marvellously.     Little Oblivions  brings Julien Baker into full bloom. The bare-skinned vulnerability is still here even with bigger, fuller arrangements. You can make reasonably adequate comparisons to big-budget indie rock like Florence + the Machine, the National and Arcade Fire (all of whom have worked with Craig Silvey, who mixed  Little Oblivions  and Baker's 2017 record,  Turn Out the Lights ), and you could also liken some of the album's style to Now, Now and Sharon Van Etten. But Baker has developed a distinctive enough voice — and has maintained it even as her public identity has gotten wrapped up in boygenius, whose other members also happen to appear here on ""Favor"" — that it remains singular, even surrounded with more elaborate instrumentation. These songs would be just as impactful as solo performances, just as earlier songs like ""Turn Out the Lights"" and ""Rejoice"" would thrive with full-band arrangements. The expressiveness, desperation and dynamic range of Baker's voice will still stop you in your tracks. ""I can see where this is going, but I can't find the brake,"" she sings so powerfully in ""Hardline,"" coming to the first of several big crescendos.     The truth is that Baker's music will hit hard no matter how it's played. She's one of those songwriters who can dig into the deepest, darkest pit of your heart, whether you're the type of person who struggles to feel or the type who feels too much, too intensely. No one who's listening to her songs has experienced exactly what she's experienced, but everyone who's listening to her songs has felt how she's felt. They just might need someone to put it into the right words — and that's one of Baker's great strengths.    ""I'll believe you if you make me feel something,"" Baker sings in ""Faith Healer,"" a rousing, uptempo highlight of the record. ""I wish that I drank because of you and not only because of me,"" she croons in ""Song in E,"" a stirring piano ballad that calls back to her  Sprained Ankle  days. ""Beat myself until I'm bloody, and I'll give you a ringside seat,"" she declares in ""Ringside,"" before the rhythm section comes in like a knockout punch. ""When the drugs wear off, will the love kick in?"" she inquires in ""Repeat,"" one of her most uncharacteristically hopeful-sounding songs. And from ""Hardline,"" again: ""Start asking for forgiveness in advance for all the future things I will destroy.""     Listening to Baker's previous albums sometimes felt like an intrusion into her most private moments. The content here is just as deeply personal — unflinching looks at depression, critical confrontations with violence, rigorous examinations of addiction and sobriety, and shaky-voiced pleas to God — but she makes you feel more welcome than ever to share in her process of angst and self-discovery. The album's bigger, fuller sound brings Baker's melodies to new heights and casts her gaze out more broadly, making  Little Oblivions  a far less gruellingly stark and isolating experience. It just so happens, as well, to arrive at a time when the majority of our interactions and dialogues are not with each other, but with ourselves.  Little Oblivions  is generous and giving; it's not only a public display of personal catharsis, but also an act of collective commiseration and an invitation to heal.

2021-02-22,Daniel Sylvester,7,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Stereolab Unearth Long-Lost Classics on 'Electrically Possessed [Switched On Volume 4]',,"Just months after the release of their 1992 debut full-length,  Peng! ,  Stereolab  were already collecting odds and ends, collecting early 7-inches and EPs for their  Switched On  compilation. Over the next six years, the eclectic avant-pop band would put out two more highly-regarded and beloved additions to their  Switched On  series, proving that they were utterly incapable of putting out bad music during the '90s.     Electrically Possessed [Switched On Volume 4] , picks up from where 1998's  Aluminum Tunes [Switched On Volume 3]  left off. Covering Stereolab's least-celebrated era, the 25-track, 104-minute compilation spans the years between 1999's  Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night  and their final proper studio release, 2008's  Chemical Chords . The first 40 minutes — dedicated to  The First of the Microbe Hunters , an EP from 2000 that was mostly maligned by critics upon its release — hasn't exactly improved with age aside from the rubbery, melodic standout ""Household Names.""    After those seven tracks, the compilation jumps around from era to era, pairing tracks like the magnificent IDM-influenced 2006 single ""Solar Throw-Away (Original Version)"" with the jagged, icy instrumental ""Pandora's Box of Worms"" (the album's only unreleased track) and the late-career throwback B-side ""L'exotisme Interieur"" before retreating to the swirling synth sound of the 1999 A-side ""The Super It."" Although these timeline leaps mess with the album's overall flow, there's nonetheless plenty of gems to be found, as the skittering electronic bleeps of ""B.U.A"" (a hard-to-find track only used in a '98 museum exhibition), blends Stereolab's experimental sonic adventures with vocalist Lætitia Sadier's lovely penchant for melody, while the dancefloor-ready propulsion of the 2005 France-only release, ""Dimension M2,"" stands firmly as one of the band's long-lost classics.     Despite the fact that the compilation completely omits their six excellent 7-inch singles released between 2005 and 2006 (already compiled on 2006's  Fab Four Suture ), it's surprising to see that this sprawling collection offers no real throwaways, as demos, live cuts and BBC Radio sessions are smartly omitted, something that has weighed down similar compilations put out by their peers. That said, there's a fair share of material here that's simply uninspired, as tracks like ""Explosante Fixe"" and ""Monkey Jelly"" rehash the same ideas that sank the last few Stereolab albums.    Although it may stand as the frailest of the  Switched On  series (so far, at least — the band have teased that  a  Volume 5  is on its way ),  Electrically Possessed  contains some of their most daring, buoyant and surprisingly solid set of songs, framing Stereolab as a band who managed to stay adventurous and weird right to the end.

2021-02-22,Aly Laube,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Black Dresses Return from the Beyond for Their Freakish Magnum Opus, 'Forever in Your Heart'",,"Black Dresses  were a duo from Toronto that blew expectations of pop music out of the water, culminating in 2020's  Peaceful as Hell . The duo of Ada Rook and Devi McCallion had collaborated with  Backxwash  and contributed to  100 gecs ' recent remix album , bringing more much-deserved attention to the boundary-busting act. But just as they were starting to break out,  they broke up . Now, they've returned from the beyond to deliver a new album as a present to hungry fans.     Forever in Your Heart  might give you whiplash, but its unpredictable genre-switching makes for a high-octane listen full of more fun and rage than anything Black Dresses have done before. The record is so painfully sincere that it's next to impossible to listen without wanting to break everything in the room.     Rook and McCallion stay right in your ear, whether they're giving you Purity Ring-style cooing, Trent Reznor's growly whine, or the unbridled screams of the Assistant. Industrial percussion and chugging metal guitars set the foundation for the album, calling to the harsh mania of Sleigh Bells and the crushing production of Ministry. Notably, Rook sounds blasé enough to drop the mic until she busts into a full-fledged scream, a focal point of the album's idiosyncratic mashup of metal, EDM, glitch and pop.    As always, Black Dresses stay relatable through blunt, existential lyrics and splashes of tongue-in-cheek humour. On ""We'll Figure It Out,"" they sing about the anxiety of being part of a generation left to deal with ""10,000 years of problems"" before launching into a ludicrous dance breakdown. The album's drowning in desperation and frustration, with lines like ""I don't give a shit if it doesn't work / I've done a lot of things and none of them worked. / We're fucking in a trap!""    On the first song, ""PEACESIGN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"" they ask, ""Can we make something beautiful with no hope?"" But there's no answer. If anything,  Forever in Your Heart  reads as an angry eye-roll at the nuisance of living in a cis-heterosexual, patriarchal society. It's a funeral for childhood dreams, an ode to apathy, and a reflection on what it means to have a physical form — topped with a wallop of absurdist fun.     The members of Black Dresses, both trans women, write often about the pressures of conformity. This translates in their music, with electronic disruptions standing out on tracks like ""Bulldozer."" Its droning beat is set to an iconic chorus: ""My pussy like a bulldozer / Drilling and grinding / My pussy like a blown-out speaker / My pussy like nothing at all / So it doesn't matter."" McCallion laments, ""I wanted to be like the other girls / Now I'm just like the other girls."" There's no joy in it — and Black Dresses lives inside those let-downs. This shows through the pair's vocals, which oscillate between blown-out screams and nearly catatonic talk-singing.    Even with the inclusion of softer tracks throughout, there is no reprieve from the emotional whirlwind that is  Forever in Your Heart . It's auditory overwhelm at its finest, but there's so much dynamism and intention to unpack that you can listen five times over and find something new with every play. It's a party bag of influences grounded by too-cool-to-care vocals, making for a combination of sounds that's unforgettable and incredibly satisfying.    Despite its coolness,  Forever in Your Heart  holds an intentional conversation. ""People try to tell you your place in it / But isn't that just for them?"" they write on the last track, ""(Can't) Keep It Together."" Again, there are no answers here, just a question — a peek into the lives of the people behind the music.     There are surprising moments of vulnerability on  Forever in Your Heart , bringing listeners close to say goodbye. ""I'm a person inside a person inside a girl / I used to be million different things for a million different dreams and hopes / But now I'm nothing,"" they write on ""(Can't) Keep It Together."" The word ""pain"" comes up over and over again on the album, but it's no pity party. If anything,  Forever in Your Heart  is the freakish magnum opus of Black Dresses, sure to inspire the next generation of experimental musicians and fans.  (Independent)                            REVIEWS   ALBUM   METAL AND HARDCORE   DANCE AND ELECTRONIC   POP AND ROCK   MUSIC              More Black Dresses",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/black_dresses_forever_in_your_heart_album_review
2021-02-22,Matt Bobkin,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Montreal's Isaac Vallentin Says a Lot with a Little on '""...""'",,"The minimalist nature of  Isaac Vallentin 's  ""…"" , his third solo album, belies how thoughtful the Montreal-based singer-songwriter is with every element of his music. Stark, evocative cover art and lengthy, meticulously detailed (not to mention, immaculately written) liner notes are staples of Vallentin's work, both as a solo artist and with his side project, Regular Expression (cleverly abbreviated as RegEx). His penchant for obsessively fine-tuning his work has yielded intriguing results such as the two competing versions of his second solo album,  Amateur  — the initial 2018 version and a formerly scrapped version with a different mix and tracklist released in 2020 for a Japanese record label — or the recent  No Hiding , credited to the Regular Expression Jazz Ensemble and built around a series of a friend's piano improvisations, resuscitated and augmented years later by contributions from other collaborators. Even Regular Expression's  Kasuga Suite , a series of solo acoustic guitar tracks that runs less than 15 minutes, is accompanied by six paragraphs on the relationship between Vallentin, his guitar and the EP's track names.    By stripping down his sound on  ""…"" , Vallentin has laid bare the strengths of his songwriting. Featuring little more than his raw and ragged voice, acoustic guitar and harmonica, Vallentin makes the weighty tragedies of loss, colonialism, capitalism and climate change sound almost breezy with an understated folk palette, allowing his words to hit extra hard, the culmination of years of thoughtful exploration into the regularities of human life. Where previous albums have taken Vallentin across provinces and even continents,  ""…""  finds comfort in tight spaces and stringent restrictions, a successful and timely example of building engaging, vivid worlds without needing to leave the house.    Song structures have been painstakingly crafted and executed — a look at the provided lyrics reveals choruses distributed evenly with mathematical precision, stanzas and rhyme scenes strictly adhering to self-evident patterns. And yet,  ""…""  never feels bogged down in the details. It comes off light, natural and rhythmic, even as it stretches simple guitar patterns past a song's seven-minute mark, as it does for three of the album's six tracks. Lengthy opener ""Diane in the Morning Light"" slowly draws listeners into the world of its titular character, Vallentin homing in on specific details — her earring, cigarette, ink-stained bed sheets — as the magnitude of her tragedy wades murkily into focus.    He takes a similar approach on ""The Ballad of Nunangat,"" the album's centrepiece, letting tactile objects and fragmented memories tell the story of Inuit communities devastated by colonial violence and cultural genocide: ""In the store there's treasures from the south / But they don't bring us any real wealth, the empty shelves,"" and, ""There are songs that we were forced to sing / But it's the drum connecting everything, still beating."" The album's title — Vallentin offers pronunciations of ""ellipsis"" or ""dot dot dot"" — accentuates the space in which he conjures emotional affect. Much like how today's limited confines have stirred up unforeseen reckonings by stripping away the distractions, Vallentin uses empty space to make the few remaining elements make as much impact as possible, earning every second of his lengthy meditations.    Just because the album finds its strength in emotional heft doesn't mean it's no fun. With its swaying harmonica and folksy strum, ""Three Scenes of the Apocalypse in Montréal"" turns an acid trip in the city into its own free-wheeling folk version of verbose classics like ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" or ""It's the End of the World as We Know It,"" as Montreal sinks into the abyss under the weight of its urban spectacle. Modern excesses and climate catastrophe never sounded so jolly.    Where his previous albums leaned on Andy Shauf-style orchestrations or folksy electronics to accentuate his idiosyncratic musings, Vallentin has let the full power of his poetry ring out here. While he's never been one to stick to a particular sound or approach,  ""…""  makes it clear that his true strength lay within all along.

2021-02-23,Mark Tremblay,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Black Sheep Wall's 'Songs for the Enamel Queen' Is an Unexpected Sludge Metal Standout,,"A six-year break between albums was worth it for what is arguably  Black Sheep Wall 's best record. So much has changed about this group, yet the core elements of their sound remain intact. Trading in slow plodding riffs for unorthodox melodies makes  Songs for the Enamel Queen  the most vulnerable and sonically dense album in the band's catalogue.  Songs for the Enamel Queen  is a celebration of the band's past while also being a step forward into new sonic territory.       Songs for the Enamel Queen  is a sickening experience of heartache and loss. Long-gone are the bathroom jokes and shots at the Lambgoat community. Songs like ""Ren"" and ""New Measures of Failure"" capture the feelings and despair that come with self-loathing and fractured relationships in a way that few heavy bands can articulate. This is never more present than on the nightmarish ""Mr. Gone,"" featuring vocals from several of the band's former members, where a collage of different voices are used to create the effect of a troubled inner dialogue.     Songs for the Enamel Queen  is full of heaviness, but it comes in unexpected ways. There are plenty of classic Black Sheep Wall riff moments like the sludgy plods on ""Concrete God"" and the opening tapping runs on ""Human Shaped Hole,"" but that is only telling a small part of the story. Instead of walls of feedback and distortion, some of the heaviest moments are the trumpet arrangement on ""Ren"" or the shoegaze melodic outro on ""Prayer Sheet for Wound and Nail,"" the latter made all the more impactful by the vocal line ""I honestly thought things would be better, I don't like who I am.""     Songs for the Enamel Queen  is the perfect beginning to Black Sheep Wall's second act. Just when one thought things couldn't get more dire than their previous offering,   I'm Going to Kill Myself ,  Songs for the Enamel Queen  takes things to a completely different territory. The album perfectly honours the past of sludge and doom while blowing open the door to where the future lays for this band sonically.  Songs for the Enamel Queen  is an unexpected standout from one of sludge metal's most underappreciated bands.

2021-02-23,Aly Laube,8,"R&B,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",TiKA's 'Anywhere but Here' Is an Exuberant Celebration of Black Queer Love,,"""I'm not a woman. I'm not a man. I'm something you will never understand,"" TiKA sings near the end of their debut record,  Anywhere but Here . It's a profound indicator of the theme of the album: finding balance and self-love as a queer person of colour. The 10-track LP is a collection of positive self-affirmations and reflections on relationships, well-being and authenticity seldom heard in mainstream Canadian music.    Sonically,  Anywhere but Here  revolves around R&B vocals, pop structure and stylistic experimentation. Tracks like ""Soothing Love"" boast the dramatic sultriness of D'Angelo's  Black Messiah , while others play with EDM elements, harkening back to the sugary pop of early MGMT and modern-day Robyn. There are plenty of surprises in the instrumentals, with acoustic guitar and steel drums making unexpected appearances on what would otherwise be relatively straightforward songs. TiKA's low, emotive voice anchors the record, drawing listeners in with the singer's natural vulnerability and personality.     Although the album benefits from crystal clean pop production, it traverses lyrical ground rarely covered on the radio. Queer people of colour may find their words resonant. On ""Walking Disaster,"" they write, ""Is this love? Are you my master?"" The themes of fantasy in Blackness and the beauty of queer Black intimacy are exemplified by lead single ""Sideways,"" produced by fellow queer Canadian pop breakout,  Casey MQ , with pounding stomp-and-clap percussion, dissonant sirens and an unforgettable vocal hook (""I keep on falling sideways / Rhythm hold me"").    Throughout the album, TiKA asks, how much sacrifice is too much in love? How do we heal and own ourselves as people who live outside the cis-heterosexual white patriarchy? How do we celebrate ourselves when the people we love can't do the same? There are no answers on this record; only reflections that encourage listeners to look inward.    Despite its relative brilliance,  Anywhere but Here  starts to feel repetitive around late-album track ""Ishmil,"" another reflection on a relationship set to an electronic loop that slowly builds around TiKA's voice. But things rebound with the final track, ""Unless UR Mine,"" a queer anthem dedicated to the struggle of dating someone in the closet. The song delivers a compelling combination of EDM and airy dance pop that's liberating and celebratory. It also features a ripping saxophone solo, which adds another touch of style — not that the record needs it — before ending with a monologue about how panic affects the body, a fitting end to an album mostly concerned with Black, queer wellness.     Anywhere but Here  is undeniably honest, cohesive and self-assured from front to back — a strong debut album from TiKA.

2021-02-23,Sarah Bea Milner,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Bet Smith's 'Downer' Makes Contemporary Folk Timeless,,"Bet Smith  may be one of Canada's most underappreciated folk artists, and her latest album,  Downer , is set to change that. The album is an unabashed and honest testament to 2020, expressed through minimalist instrumentation, evocative lyrics and powerful vocals. Recorded with the Currie Brothers in Gravenhurst, ON, the album is an understated exploration of Smith's personal pain, anxiety, and — most importantly — capacity to love.      Largely a collaboration between Smith and her frequent artistic partner, Rob Currie,  Downer  is a firmly contemporary folk release that feels timeless. The production is limited, showcasing the personality of its acoustic instruments and Smith's command of her voice.  Downer  leans on its strengths by putting Smith at the forefront, complemented by an assortment of organ, guitar, and basic percussion. As a result, the songs seem deceptively simple on the surface, but each draws power from the sheer vulnerability and sincerity of its construction.     The album borrows the sounds of the past as it looks forward to the future: it at times casts a foreboding shadow of dread, such as the (subtle) environmentalist warnings in tracks like ""What Matters Most"" and ""Downer."" Yet, spirituality also permeates the album, imparting an optimistic note that prevents the message from sliding into cynicism. Without relying on feel-good new-age clichés,  Downer  manages to be hopeful about what comes next — while reminding listeners of one's personal responsibility to make that happen.    The songs on  Downer  are complicated. The opening track, ""Forgive You,"" is a driving mid-tempo track that is almost at odds with its lyrical content: a condemnation of an unnamed offender, juxtaposed with the victim's deep desire to just move on. ""North Ontario"" is ostensibly about Smith's rural life, but her haunted delivery and sombre refrain ""Truth is I'm still working on letting you go"" suggest the song is less about where she ended up, and more how she got there. While these and other tracks appear deeply personal, they also feel deeply relatable.     Two of the tracks on  Downer  were previously recorded on the 2017 release  Tightropes & Loose Ends , and fans of Smith's work will likely find the new versions lacking. ""Signs of Hostility"" appears on  Downer  in a much stripped-down form that begs for a bass line, while ""What Matters Most"" isn't improved by the new simpler approach. While both tracks better fit the overall ethos of  Downer  in this form, they feel lacking — at least compared to the previous iterations.     Bet Smith is no newcomer to the genre, and she's been releasing music regularly since 2015's  Loose Ends . Yet, the artist has yet to really break out into the greater Ontario folk scene. If she continues to create music like  Downer , it could be only a matter of time before that happens.

2021-02-24,Luke Pearson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Danny L Harle Is Here to Save '90s Rave with 'Harlecore',,"Popular music has been borrowing '80s synth sounds for what seems like a while now, both in the Top 40 and otherwise, with some examples sounding almost parodic at this point. (The Weeknd's wildly popular ""Blinding Lights"" comes to mind.) But what about the '90s? Love Inc., Vengaboys, Aqua, and Eiffel 65 are seemingly muse to few in 2021.    Enter British producer and PC Music alum  Danny L Harle , arriving like some kind of rave saviour, with a high-concept debut full-length featuring an entire stable of alter-egos, all taking their inspiration from this sometimes overlooked decade of electronic music.    Indeed, cheekily titled  Harlecore , it is full to bursting with '90s rave goodness — it's big, fun, and just a little bit dumb, all delivered with a massive meta wink from Harle himself, whose various personas (ranging from the ethereal DJ Ocean to the breathless MC Boing) get amusing name-drops from various genre-specific announcers throughout, just like in the days of yore. Detractors may venture that it comes across a bit trite or superficial at times, but a brassy surface sheen was a big part of the appeal of this music in the first place, and these tracks gleam like a new Sony Discman.    Much of the fun of  Harlecore  lies in picking out the various influences or references on display: the stomping synth line of ""Interlocked"" is reminiscent of Reel 2 Reel's ""I Like to Move It,"" the unfiltered piano chords of ""Piano Song"" are straight out of ""Charly""-era Prodigy, and the melismatic siren calls of ""Ocean's Theme"" (courtesy of what sounds like an uncredited  Caroline Polachek , whose  acclaimed 2019 debut  Harle executive produced) are a winning exercise in downtempo trance taken from the BT or Paul Van Dyk playbook. There's even some faint gang vocals á la venerable German hardcore group Scooter, who have been carrying the rave torch with a straight face for the last 25 years.    Harle is a lot more self-aware however, rarely getting lost in the excess, and if a few of the lesser offerings on Harlecore veer close to sounding like merely a collection of tropes and knowing production techniques, a particularly arresting bass or synth line always arrives to save the day. The brisk 38-minute runtime means you're never far away from the next amusing flourish, and while the overall style and sound bank are definitely all '90s, the production is impeccably current, with everything popping as brightly as the album's sparkling cover art. (Fittingly, Harle himself looks like he's been taken out of an episode of  ReBoot .)     Harlecore  is '90s rave held up for review, assessment and full enjoyment, and if there isn't a ton of depth here, the breadth (with Harle essentially exploring four different sub-styles through his various personas) is more than impressive enough to make up for it. It's all pulled off with such glee and energy, that in terms of pure enjoyment, it's very difficult to fault  Harlecore .

It's a project that bursts at the seams with style and intricacies, clearly garnering more than a single description. Whether breaking free of unfulfilling relationships or standing up to oppressive systems and structures, liberation is written all over  Three Little Words , brazenly and unabashedly, through the sound of lush soul.     Three Little Words  completes the Montreal-based singer's album trilogy exploring the roots and culture of African-American music, third in the line up behind her blues-oriented debut,  Nameless  (2018), and the '60s jazz-oriented follow-up,  Stay Tuned!  (2019). The final installment of the trilogy serves as a melting pot for the genres and sounds previously explored, but with soul taking centre stage.    The album is a time capsule, honouring Black history and music, while also offering a glimpse into the future, as Fils-Aimé sings of being the change in the world instead of waiting around for one on the swelling, steady build-up of ""While We Wait."" Lead single ""Love Take Over"" is an anthem of celebrating Black femininity and dismantling the patriarchy. Fils-Aimé's vocals are deep and smoky, reminiscent of a modern-day Nina Simone with traces of Billie Holiday, as she floats from song to song.     A blend of sounds and emotions, all distinct but able to meld together to create a cohesive body of work, come together on this album. There's the striking, layered percussion and harmonies of the titular track, to a minimalist cover of Ben E. King's ""Stand by Me"" as a delightful closer. Amongst the mix, most of the songs on the record are short and quiet, simmering underneath their calm surfaces with life. Fils-Aimé has certainly achieved a feeling of conclusion with her album trilogy, as  Three Little Words  serves as its hushed yet powerful final bow.

Unlike some of her previous work on  Petals for Armor  or Paramore's  After Laughter  that juxtapose dismal lyrics with upbeat arrangements, the songs on  FLOWERS for VASES  don't hide their true meanings behind bubbly pop music.      FLOWERS for VASES  feels deeply intimate — you can hear the sounds of an airplane interrupting Williams as she tries to record ""HYD"" and the sound of a child laughing (perhaps a soundbite from her family's home video collection) on the ""Descansos"" interlude. The instrumentation throughout the whole album is simple — an acoustic guitar or piano chords, the occasional drum beat ramping up the tempo — so the focus is placed on Williams's strong and solid vocals.     Because there isn't a lot of production to hide behind, listeners can concentrate on the pure poetry of the lyrics.  FLOWERS for VASES  wallows in its grief, and invites listeners to embrace their grief too. ""For every fairy tale untrue / And all the hearts yet to be broken / For every bird who never flew / Well, it's a wonder we keep going without you,"" Williams muses on ""Wait On.""    Williams has always been an honest lyricist, and it's because she's been open about her emotional trauma and depression that listeners can empathize with her; ""I put all my demons on display / to your pretty music"" she sings in ""Good Grief."" The lyrical themes of the album include the emotional trauma of her past relationships (""First Thing to Go,"" ""My Limb""), her difficult childhood (""Inordinary"") and finding hope in the future (""Over Those Hills""). She makes several lyrical references to previous songs she has written — a notable lyric, ""The hurt is half the fun"" in ""Over Those Hills,"" is a callback to Paramore's ""That's What You Get,"" where she sings ""Why do we like to hurt so much?""    Seven albums and 16 years into her music career, Williams seems more confident than ever in doing as she pleases instead of pleasing others. As she proclaims in the album's closing song, ""Just a Lover,"" ""No more music for the masses.""

2021-02-10,Ian Gormely,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Claud Levels Up While Staying True to Their Bedroom Pop Roots on 'Super Monster',,"How do you take your music to the next level without losing what made it special in the first place? This is the dilemma faced by any artist after their first brush with success.    By definition, bedroom pop musicians — a loose collection of artists with viral stars in their eyes making intimate art on their own terms — should be anathema to this sort of upskilling. Yet, Billie Eilish blew up the bedroom aesthetic to blockbuster proportions, moving the genre's most visible artists from the margins of the Internet towards the mainstream. Today, bedroom pop increasingly describes a musical aesthetic — quiet, warm, intimate — rather than its means of production and plenty of artists (and industry types) are looking to capture even a fraction of the attention Eilish generated. But what happens when you spend thousands of dollars to make music that is supposed to cost pennies?     Sitting at the vortex of this dichotomy is Claud Mintz. Mintz first came to prominence performing as one-half of Toast, and were briefly signed to Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear's Terrible Records, who released Toast's college dorm room-recorded debut back in 2018. Mintz has since kept up a steady stream of singles and EPs under the name  Claud , building a fanbase drawn to their plain-spoken tales of modern love and searching for community. They built bridges to like-minded artists, including  Clairo , with whom they recently formed a side-project called Shelly, and caught the attention of  Phoebe Bridgers , who is releasing  Super Monster , Claud's debut album, as the first record on  her new label, Saddest Factory Records .    The buzz around Claud's debut would be strong based on its pedigree alone, but Claud seems to be looking beyond the bedroom.  Super Monster  was recorded at none other than Electric Lady Studios, where artists from Led Zeppelin to Lady Gaga, the Soulquarians and Kanye West have made genre-defying records. It's the kind of place DAW-based home studios, like the ones Claud and their bedroom pop peers made their names with, were supposed to put out of business. Claud is hardly the first bedroom artist to go hi-fi — Clairo recorded her debut with Danielle Haim, Rostam and Dave Fridmann — but choosing such a hallowed studio is a statement of intent.     To be sure,  Super Monster  contains all the usual bedroom pop signifiers — light R&B grooves, chorus-drenched guitars à la Mac DeMarco. But Mintz and their close-knit circle of collaborators (including Clairo, former Toast bandmate Josh Mehling,  Nick Hakim  and  Unknown Mortal Orchestra 's Jake Portrait) achieve this without succumbing to its pitfalls, namely the thin, washed-out sound that can make every song sound the same.     Super Monster  is different. Across its 13 songs, the beats are crisp, the choruses pronounced and the hooks sharp. ""Soft Spot"" bumps and ""In or In Between"" is almost funky, neither of which are really things you can say about most bedroom pop. During the coda to ""Guard Down,"" a plead for emotional vulnerability, all the instrumentation cuts out, leaving just a rough recording of Mintz and an acoustic guitar, exposing how layered the production of these songs are while simultaneously exposing the sturdy bones at the foundation of each.    Perhaps most notable is the mutability of Mintz's sound, which they adapt to everything from torch songs (""Rocks at Your Window"") to pop-punk (""That's Mr. Bitch to You""). Closer and standout ""Falling with the Rain"" — featuring Clairo, Mehling and Noa Getzug, essentially making it a Shelly track — is chugging mid-tempo indie rock. Yet, Mintz's indelible fingerprints are all over them.    It's doubtful even its creators could say how much of  Super Monster  can be credited to the hi-fi environment in which it was created — most of the songs were already written before Claud stepped foot in the studio. And while many artists will rely on their bedroom set-ups out of financial necessity, the album is a roadmap for anyone hoping to keep to open the bedroom door to the world outside without losing the gauzy comfort of home.

2021-02-11,Ian Gormely,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Small Sins Turn Back the Clock on 'Volume II',,"Getting older sucks. You're slower, you feel out of touch, hangovers hurt more and linger longer. Doors also start closing. Those things you've put off over the years start to become ""What could have been?"" instead of ""What could be?""    There are plenty of ways to deal with this last point. Yet,  Thomas D'Arcy  appears to have found one of the most productive and creatively rewarding paths. D'Arcy has framed  Volume II , the first new material from his band  Small Sins  in over a decade, as a do-over of sorts, a chance to rekindle the creative juices of his youth with the life experience of person sliding into middle-age. As Faces famously put it, ""I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger.""    D'Arcy, Small Sins' mastermind and sole constant member, emerged at a juncture when the shackles of what was acceptable in indie rock were coming off. Once verboten, synths and other electronic aids were suddenly on the table. In 2006, Small Sins' self-titled debut captured this moment with an intimate and effervescent blend of digital and analogue, buoyed by some seriously hooky songs. A deal with Astralwerks gave their follow-up, 2007's  Mood Swings , a massive platform. Yet despite some great tunes, it captured neither a wider audience nor the casual breeziness of its predecessor. A final Small Sins album,  Pot Calls Kettle Black , emerged in 2010 before D'Arcy moved into  a successful career as a producer .     Clearly, the band's denouement has never sat well with D'Arcy. He's cast  Volume II  as the spiritual successor to Small Sins' debut, using the same gear and techniques that he did a decade-and-a-half ago, in hopes of regaining some of that ineffable  je ne sais quoi  that makes so many great albums great.    The lamenting ""I Used to be a Better Man"" captures this energy best. ""Everything was for sale, so we sold all we had, everything I held dear, every promise I made,"" he sings over the album's catchiest synth riff, re-adopting the hushed whisper that lent Small Sins' debut much of its intimacy. D'Arcy's matter-of-fact tone can be jarring, and on songs like ""I Don't Care"" and ""End of the World,"" can, at first blush, come across as self-loathing. It's hard to tell if he's singing to himself or a partner. But that same casual delivery helps carry the hope and optimism of songs like the bubbly ""Together Again"" and the pulsing ""Andre.""     Volume II 's elevator pitch — ""What if  Small Sins  but 15 years later?"" — suggests an erasure of everything that came after, a retconning of the band's later history. That seems wholly unnecessary; both  Mood Swings  and  Pot Calls Kettle Black , while not as successful commercially or artistically, were certainly good albums, both with some great songs worth revisiting today. It also begs the question: why resurrect the project in the first place? Looking at his post-Small Sins career, D'Arcy appears to be a reasonably successful producer, working with artists like Yukon Blonde and The Sheepdogs, releasing music under his own name when he sees fit. The group never had a terribly steady line-up (over-enthusiastic percussionist Kevin ""The Clapper"" Hilliard didn't even play on the band's debut).    Yet,  Volume II  feels like the most personal work D'Arcy's produced since, well, Small Sins' debut. It inevitably fails to live up to it's counterpart, but that hardly seems to have been the point. D'arcy clearly had some things he wanted to get off his chest that that record's sound were uniquely suited to conveying.    The record closes with ""Stuck with Each Other,"" a self-effacing slow burn that celebrates, in a vaguely sardonic way, the joy of love for the long haul. It would very easily fit on any Eels record. But it's also fun to think of the song's lyric as describing the ongoing conversation between an artist and their art: ""I'm stuck with you, and you're stuck with me and that's nice.""

Harmony,8,"R&B,REVIEWS,EP,ALBUM,MUSIC",Lucky Daye Explores the Ugly Side of Romance on 'Table for Two' EP,,"At first glance,  Table for Two  has all the markings of a Valentine's Day haymaker: it's an EP full of duets from R&B darling  Lucky Daye  with rising stars like YEBBA,  Ari Lennox  and  Tiana Major9  to complement him. The description conjures thoughts of candlelit dinners and the passionate nights that often follow. But, when you pull it apart,  Table for Two  is an exploration of the uglier side of romance that's clever in more ways than one.     With a voice like plush velvet, Daye laments over unanswered texts (""On Read"" ft. Tiana Major9), emotional unavailability (""Access Denied"" ft. Ari Lennox) and the painful realization that a toxic relationship has reached its end (""My Window"" ft. Mahalia). ""How Much Can a Heart Take,"" which features an assist from Arkansan songstress YEBBA, is the EP's crown jewel. It's a bitter break-up track that plays like whiskey with a honey chaser. The verses are full of fiery attitude but thanks to YEBBA's spotlight-stealing vocals, the song unfolds into something lush and sweet near the chorus.    Though the EP is light on ""I love you""s, it's not nearly as depressing as it sounds. The instrumentals are deceptively warm and soulful throughout and Daye's honeyed voice betrays the biting, sometimes tortured lyrics. It's that juxtaposition that makes  Table for Two  so much fun.     There's also another hidden surprise for listeners who want to dig a little deeper. It's just a theory, but like Kendrick Lamar's  DAMN  or  undun  by the Roots,  Table for Two  takes on a whole new meaning when consumed in reverse. Listen to ""Falling in Love"" (featuring Joyce Wrice) first rather than last and it reveals two lovers who, despite their doubts, are about to leap into an official relationship. Things are great in the beginning (""Dream,"" Daye's duet with Queen Naija, is heavy on the lovey-doveyness one would expect so close to Valentine's Day), but they quickly take a turn. There's great sex with no emotion (""Access Denied""), and enough toxicity to make the couple want to call it quits (""My Window""). Texts start going ignored (""On Read"") and, finally, the couple breaks, realizing that their feelings were too fickle to maintain anything real (""How Much Can A Heart Take""). Mind blown!     For those looking for more of the soul-stirring heartiness Daye delivered on his 2019 triumph,  Painted , they'll find it here. But  Table for Two  is no repeat: it's a stretch project that's compact, smart and definitely worth repeating.

2021-02-16,Oliver Crook,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Hold Steady Make Room to Experiment on 'Open Door Policy',,"Few bands have left a larger footprint in the mud of 21st-century rock than  the Hold Steady . While 2006's  Boys and Girls in America  became the definitive soundtrack for a generation of uncertain youth, it serves as only one touchstone in a catalogue of highlights. The band's latest offering,  Open Door Policy , finds the six-piece at their most comfortable — and experimental.    Continuing with the expanded lineup reintroduced on 2019's  Thrashing Thru the Passion , the Hold Steady are demonstrating the comfort levels of a band with something to say but nothing to prove.     This comfort is the result of many things, the most obvious being age, but also changes in touring schedules and writing processes that better fit the lives of 40-something-rock stars. After doing two records without keyboardist  Franz Nicolay  and then taking a hiatus, they reunited with Nicolay in 2019 for  Thrashing Thru the Passion , a record that saw them dip their toes back in the musical waters. Now, they're diving in headfirst.     Open Door Policy  carries all the trademarks of a Hold Steady record: Craig Finn's distinctive vocals are supported by an effortlessly distorted sound that is equally as complex. Finn's lyrics are scattered with shady characters and messed-up souls, but there's more of an edge on  Open Door Policy . Recorded in 2019, its themes of mental health, income inequality and isolation feels all the more relevant today. Tracks such as ""Lanyards"" — which stands among one of the Hold Steady's best songs — are enveloping and heartbreaking, while ""Spices"" demonstrates they've shed some of the apprehension of  Thrashing Thru The Passion  and know where every band member fits in.    But don't confuse  Open Door Policy  for a microwaved reheating of their Americana sound. The band didn't end their hiatus just for the money — there is more musical ground to cover. The electric beats of ""Unpleasant Breakfast"" expresses this experimental side, while the ""Woo""s on the chorus feel like a reinvention of the backing vocals of the mid-2000s rock scene they exploded out of. On ""Riptown,"" the Hold Steady do their best impression of the Band with a jaunty, bass-lead rhythm, loose horns and a honky-tonk style piano that recalls a smoke-filled bar. While not all the experiments work out — see the aforementioned ""Woo""s — it's refreshing to see an old band try new tricks.    Where  Open Door Policy  really excels, however, is its constant sense of anxiety. Like one of those great nights the Hold Steady have spent two decades singing about, morning always comes eventually. Even the momentary, horn-fuelled releases aren't enough to fully relieve the tension. If art mimics life, then  Open Door Policy 's musical tension, timely themes and efforts to reimagine the band while remaining authentic deftly capture today's world.

2021-02-16,Joe Bagel,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Montreal's Freelove Fenner Deliver Danceable New Wave on 'The Punishment Zone',,"Montreal's art rock sleeper cell,  Freelove Fenner , have been activated. With marching orders from the same mystical power that's given us Stereolab and CAN, the duo has complyingly climbed to the top of their neighbourhood transmission tower, rerouted the broadcast and given us  The Punishment Zone , a jaunty jangle of decidedly danceable new wave numbers — sinuous, prickled, angular, lurching.    Cooked up in the cozy swell of the band's all-analog, subterranean music lab,  The Punishment Zone  is a diptych that pits two elemental forces against one another: the gauzy vocals of Caitlin Loney float like Chanel-scented whispers above her and partner Peter Woodford's sedulous orchestra, a riptide of slanted guitars, flutes and organs.    With arrangements that hack irreverently at the white picket fences separating new wave, no wave, punk and psychedelia, the duo proffer pop hooks on their own terms — drawing on influences that variously smack of the United States of America, TOPS (whose vocalist Jane Penny appears here as a flautist), the Cure and Pylon.    Pleasantly anodyne songs like ""August Parties"" conjure the familiar likes of Melody's Echo Chamber, but the band sounds most interesting when it swims against pop convention. The rhythmically ambitious ""Perfect Master"" is like something out of Dirty Projectors dunked in an ashtray, while the seductive 80's timepiece ""Carol"" conjures a smouldering dive bar with all of the fixins. Black leather jackets. Splash pools of Jameson. Lurking in the back in a ragged New Order T-shirt, a bongo-mashing maestro: life of the party.    Groovy, poised and gorgeously tilted,  The Punishment Zone  is a creative highpoint for Freelove Fenner, an illustrious Montreal band that continues to plumb the spooky for minor key pop prizes, with which this album abounds.

2021-02-17,Dylan Barnabe,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Mogwai Flirt with Convention on 'As the Love Continues',,"Twenty-five years to the day of releasing debut single ""Tuner""/""Lower,"" Scotland's beloved post-rockers  Mogwai  return with their 10th studio album. The aptly named  As the Love Continues  cements their post-rock dynasty, and bridges their ever-mutable sound into yet another.     In making  As the Love Continues , produced once more by Dave Fridmann following his work on 2017's  Every Country's Sun , Mogwai have focused on creating positive, transformative music that offered solace from the mundane. Arguably, Mogwai have made concessions over the years, albeit small, to beef up their sound (see: Fridmann) and make certain electronic inroads, resulting in more palatable music that has moved them father afield from their humble beginnings.  As the Love Continues  is highly accessible in that sense, and features one of the band's more conventional lyrical tracks to date on ""Ritchie Sacramento."" It also includes fresh collaborations with Nine Inch Nails'  Atticus Ross  (""Midnight Fit"") and saxophonist extraordinaire  Colin Stetson  (""Pat Stains"").    But that's not to say Mogwai has abandoned what makes them great. They aren't striving to recreate so much as negotiate.  As The Love Continues  recaptures the signature dynamics and lone wolf guitar solos of the band's early days without sacrificing those post-'90s gains. Album standout ""Drive the Nail"" brilliantly exploits the band's seesaw of loud-to-quiet/quiet-to-loud in a way that is immediately reminiscent of debut album  Young Team , making use of the same equilibrium that has sustained and nurtured Mogwai's success over the years. Closer ""It's What I Want To Do, Mum"" meanders in all the right ways; starkly naked until it's not. Mogwai creeps up on you, and they know it too. Reverb heavy, all-encompassing, deeply moving soundscapes that surround the listener in euphoric waves of sound that erode all sense of time and space.    Still, the genius of these Scots might just lie in their ability to redirect meaning through song. The randomness of their song titles, for one, assumes a kind of infer-at-your-own-risk policy. ""Ritchie Sacramento"" aside (whose meaning is clearly articulated by guitarist Stuart Braithwaite's dedication to ""all the musician friends we've lost over the years""), all the tracks on the album are up for interpretation. Instrumental music has long been a bastion for personal meaning and introspection, but there's something about Mogwai's exaggerated arbitrary treatment that speaks volumes. Their music is both self-aware and self-referential in that respect, forever pulling at our collective synapses to dive deep or simply skim the surface ⏤ dealer's choice.    While the sheer convergence of ""Tuner""/""Lower"" and Mogwai's 10th studio album make it hard not to indulge in comparisons, it's simply not fair to hold the band to standards created as aimless teenagers. Though you never forget your first, there are some upsides to maturing.  As the Love Continues  is one of them. Already an enduring album, it will surely solidify Mogwai's venerated status as shamans of our collective consciousness.

2021-02-17,Chris Gee,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Wild Pink Capture the Sheet Vastness of Life on 'A Billion Little Lights',,"Wild Pink's first two albums, 2017's  self-titled debut  and the following year's  Yolk in the Fur , are hidden gems — vocalist John Ross had quietly captured the numbing grandeur of classic rock poeticisms à la Tom Petty with a modernist bent. On those records, Ross sings as though he is forever staring out into the mountainous abyss, freely escaping the repetitiveness of the overstimulating New York City hustle, alongside slowly ascending guitars made for an impromptu highway drive out of town.    On their third full-length,  A Billion Little Lights , the Brooklyn three-piece continue their understated outlook on contemporary living, not markedly hopeful or pessimistic in either direction but somewhere in between; realistic and in the moment. Ross's simple, profound imagery is found throughout the album, with lines like ""dormant spore resting in the dust,"" and ""with all the honey in a rolling boil."" Wild Pink's pristine songs are about basking in the warmth of just being present, as it can be exhausting to try to find meaning in everything.    Ross's weary, soft coo recites the fleeting nature of significance as shuffling snare and burbling electronics hum on ""Amalfi"" while he turns around and half-jokingly self-loathes, ""you're a fucking baby but your pain is valid too,"" on ""Oversharers Anonymous."" On the latter song, milky violin and pedal steel guitar showcase Wild Pink's Americana side as Ross laments the overstimulation of our virtually connected world and how it tends to make us obsessively question our every decision for all to see. With  A Billion Little Lights , Ross emphasizes the need to step back and see things at a slower pace.    On lead single ""The Shining but Tropical,"" Ross muses, ""From way up high, the coast is a crisp line and all the microscopic life like a billion little lights."" This line encapsulates Wild Pink's prevailing motif on the record — trying to perceive the sheer vastness of life while still getting hung up on the tiniest of details as well. On the song, the thumping drumbeat drives a rhythm as big sounding as anything Wild Pink has ever written, doubling down on the anthemic chorus with kisses of fluttering synths exhaling gently as they pass by.    The gradual, imperceptible song transitions and unpredictable little shifts in energy that made  Yolk in the Fur  such an encompassing listen are largely absent here, in favour for more conventional song structures, though it does not necessarily take away from Wild Pink's vision. The hooks are more clearly entrenched within the baby blue sparkle of Ross' guitar playing rather than having them tucked behind a misty guitar wash. This is most apparent on the bouncy ""You Can Have It Back,"" Wild Pink's most straightforwardly catchy pop song with its highly singable ""doo-doo""s and its lightly-greased bassline chugging along. Then, with a somewhat clunky brief moment of bird chirps as a transition, opaline finger-picked guitars sparkle and engulf ""Family Friends"" like a pearly halo, highlighting the delightfully blissful harmonies with  Ratboys ' Julia Steiner, who provides heavenly backup vocals throughout the album.    While  A Billion Little Lights  as a whole is not as elegantly cohesive as Wild Pink's past work, the starry-eyed melodies shine stronger and more confidently than ever. The band's dreamy sentimental detailing and lustrous guitar work is as easily digestible as it is thought-provoking as the layers peel back into both nothing and everything at once.

2021-02-17,Kaelen Bell,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Cassandra Jenkins' 'An Overview on Phenomenal Nature' Is an Iridescent Folk-Jazz Odyssey,,"Just as the sky pales to muted pink, a cluster of light appears suspended in air. Is it a trick of the eye, or have stars congregated on the shore?  Cassandra Jenkins '  An Overview on Phenomenal Nature  lives in this moment — the real and not real, the second glance. It's a near-complete reimagining of the New York songwriter's sound; an iridescent folk-jazz odyssey dizzyingly rich with detail and craft. At only seven tracks, it feels as vast and accomplished as a record twice its length.    Thanks to Jenkins' unlayered vocals and immaculate production from Josh Kaufman, listening to  An Overview on Phenomenal Nature  feels incredibly intimate — the sounds, so precise and lovingly rendered, tickle the surface of the brain, a dance of small electrical pulses. Keys, saxophone, guitar and strings squiggle and blur like amoebas in perpetual mutation; it's a walk among the inexplicable flowers of Alex Garland's film  Annihilation , a warped and diaphanous reality. Jenkins' writing transmutes as well, as the barrier between the individual and everyone else blurs to the point of disappearance. On ""Crosshairs,"" she confides that, ""In your eyes / I see the panoply / all the people inside me."" Keyboards bubble, flutes spread like inching fungus, and a swell of meaning forms; we are pieces of everyone, and everything, around us.     An Overview on Phenomenal Nature  is full of people, fragments of the heart: Warren, Hailey, Grey, Darryl, Perry, Michelangelo and Saint Germain, mothers and old friends, unnamed security guards and presidents. However, it's the spirit of the late  David Berman , who  died by suicide in August 2019 , that appears most frequently. Prior to his death, Jenkins was set to play on his  Purple Mountains  tour —  An Overview on Phenomenal Nature  represents the sonic and psychic metamorphosis that took place in the wake of his departure.     And while the record isn't so much about Berman's death as it is mortality on a grander scale, some songs deal explicitly with his leaving. ""New Bikini"" finds Jenkins put up at a Norwegian seaside cabin, a place to mourn in solitude. She recounts repeated advice from family, friends and fishermen to let the cold water mend her wounds, casting a gentle side-eye to the idea of the ocean as a great, all-healing benevolence. But there's a sort of comfort in the belief too, a desperate urge to accept that maybe all you need to be okay is to get your blood moving — when a friend tells Jenkins that he's fallen sick again, she offers some advice: ""Baby, let's get you to the ocean / everybody's saying it cures everything.""    On the heartbreaking ""Ambiguous Norway,"" Jenkins lands in Oslo, her now purposeless Purple Mountains tour outfit stuffed in her bag. As she struggles to make sense of the loss she's come to mourn, she feels something strange and familiar in the Norwegian air: ""Farewell, Purple Mountains / I see a range of cumulus / the majesties transmutation / distant, ambiguous / The skies replace the land with air / no matter where I go / you're gone, you're everywhere."" People never really go away, she seems to say. They just become something else.    Jenkins' winding writing is cerebral and referential, nearly every song capable of opening a Wikipedia rabbit hole. However, much like Norwegian art-pop virtuoso Jenny Hval, she works wonders in the place between heart and mind; her intellectualism is never overbearing, instead revealing a dedication to explaining the unexplainable. The centerpiece of the record, and the undeniable peak of Jenkins' work to date, is the mesmerizing spoken-word of ""Hard Drive."" In a song that has all the makings of a total misfire, she finds transcendence; a stirring meditation on grand ideas and small gestures, on healing and connectivity. By releasing such depth of feeling to histories, faiths, philosophies and conceptual frameworks, she joins in the shared language of those like Berman — the people who spent their life trying to figure it out.    Instrumental closer ""The Ramble"" floats away on seven minutes of shimmering drone, snippets of field recordings and Stuart Bogie's wandering saxophone, all the delicate songs that preceded finally giving way to shapeless expression. Named for the New York City parkland famed for both its birdwatching and cruising, the song softens decades of multifaceted history into a haze of sound and feeling — connection to nature, connection to bodies, hollow bones and migration patterns, development and discovery and clandestine sexuality. The essence of  An Overview on Phenomenal Nature  is in that sticky mess of life and ideas; as histories stack atop histories, as birds fly and old friends come back in brand new shapes, existence becomes a mystifying knot.

2021-02-17,Yara El-Soueidi,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Montreal's Vanille Soundtracks the Ideal Summer on 'Soleil '96',,"In the depths of winter, it's not easy to find reminders of summertime. In a pandemic, it can be even harder to even be able to actually hope for better, warmer days to come. This is where  Vanille , the solo project of Montreal's Rachel Leblanc, comes in. Her debut album,  Soleil '96 , will warm up anyone's home and heart during uncertain times.    Rachel Leblanc's talent hasn't gone unnoticed in Quebec. Her first EP, the bilingual  My Grandfather Thinks I'm Going to Hell , garnered her attention as an artist to watch upon its release in 2017.  Soleil '96  delivers on that promise, as Leblanc transitions from garage rock influences to sunny psych and dream pop sounds that suit her voice perfectly.    Entirely in French,  Soleil '96  opens up with the very dreamy ""Carte du Ciel,"" a dream pop ballad that sounds like a smooth '70s track brought to life by Leblanc's honeyed voice. Her vocals are bewitching, and breathes life to the melancholy of each song. Her lyrics openly address her suburban sadness, illustrating her emotions and experiences through a slow tempo driven by mellow drums and guitars that pull the listener through a haze.     Leblanc is well-matched by her producer, Emmanuel Éthier, formerly of  Chocolat  and producer to fellow Francophone breakouts  P'tit Belliveau  and  Corridor . Every element of the album complements her voice without taking away from her performances. Her songs are well coordinated, with each one melting into the other, creating a pleasant, seamless experience. Leblanc is in control on every single track. In ""L'été bleu,"" she sings to a long-lost love about their summertime romance, telling them it wasn't just a dream. In standout track ""Solstice,"" Leblanc's talent is raw, pure, and vulnerable. She gives us access to her heartbreak through summery metaphors. All of Leblanc's musical ability shines through this powerful track that embodies the energy of the entire album.     Soleil '96  firmly puts Leblanc and Vanille on the map. With this strong debut, she affirms her reputation as a bright sign of the future of Canadian and Francophone music.  Soleil '96  is everything we wish for the summer to bring. It makes us hope for warmer days, picnics in the park with friends while sipping on white wine and eating pizza with sour candies.  Soleil '96  is the embodiment of better days ahead, something Vanille understands we all desperately need right now.

2021-02-01,Mark Tremblay,9,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Sarin Offer Post-Metal Catharsis on 'You Can't Go Back',,"After a three year absence, Toronto post-metal outfit  Sarin  return with their third full-length record,  You Can't Go Back . Having long drifted away from their Hydra Head Records influence, Sarin find themselves creating some of the most uplifting music in post-metal. While the album explores lyrical concepts of growth amidst personal strife, Sarin create a sonic soundscape that is cathartic in ways unlike many of their peers.     You Can't Go Back  builds itself up through series of distinctive guitar riffs that usher in emotive new movements throughout the album. From the heavy beginning of ""Cold Open,"" the chugs on ""Thick Mire,"" or the guitar solo of ""Leave Your Body,"" the riffs operate in ways that are both crushingly heavy and melodic. Perhaps the most spectacular moment on the record is the build-up on ""When You Melt""; the slow growth of shimmering guitar parts that form into a chunky plod is an emotional rollercoaster like no other.  You Can't Go Back  is an excellent showcase of how post-metal can use riffs to set mood.    Compared to Sarin's prior records, this album is surprisingly sparse in actual lyrics and vocal moments throughout. There are not many spots on the album where vocals would elevate or add to the music, which makes the few moments where they're expertly employed hit that much harder. Guitarist and vocalist David Wilson channels his inner Aaron Turner to deliver vocals that are harsh yet clear. The atonal yells balance nicely against the album's more melodic arrangements.    Sarin's  You Can't Go Back  is a post-metal album that breaks from the stereotypes of the genre with great success. The music has an immense amount of emotion without getting bogged down by slow pace and the minor chord progressions that can make post-metal repetitive. Music does not always have to be sad to make one feel strongly, and  You Can't Go Back  showcases this through various means.

2021-02-02,Scott Simpson,8,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Nick Schofield Delicately Recreates an Ottawa Architectural Gem on 'Glass Gallery',,"When the National Gallery of Canada — the building itself, not the institution — was completed in 1988, then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called it ""a living part of Canada."" The massive Moshe Safdie-designed institution remains an awe-inspiring achievement, with its 53,265-square-metre surface of pink granite, concrete and glass sitting atop Nepean Point overlooking the Ottawa River. It's no surprise this Ottawa landmark, especially the cathedral-like Colonnade and the grand windows of the Great Hall, could inspire such an expansive and buoyant release as  Glass Gallery , Ottawa-born and Montreal-based composer  Nick Schofield 's sophomore solo release.    Created on a vintage Prophet-600 synth,  Glass Gallery  is as much an exercise in restraint as it is one of expansion, pushing the limits of a single instrument in order to evoke the sense of grandeur and possibility that characterizes the experience of walking through the expansive halls of the National Gallery. The undulating topography of the Garden Court, meant to mimic pre-settlement Canadian landscape, inspires its namesake song, one of the album's briefest yet most engrossing moments. While ""Kissing Wall"" is as evocative as the name implies, rippling, echoing and looping into itself; one can almost see the waves bouncing off the sun-kissed surface.    The release of  Glass Gallery  comes at a time where appreciation for ambient music, and more specifically Japanese ambient from pioneers such as Hiroshi Yoshimura and Midori Takada, is at an all-time high. Schofield wears those influences well without succumbing to them, taking an approach akin to that of composer and programmer Laurie Spiegel, specifically referenced in the liner notes. Spiegel, who once touted the subversive nature of creating music using computers, was both precise and spontaneous in her work, culminating in the influential Music Mouse, an algorithmic musical composition software, and a career that continues to amaze and inspire.    With the prospect of a long, isolated winter, the levity and calmness offered by Schofield is a welcome respite, an album that can be equally appreciated through attentive or casual listening, following you easily from desk to sink, shower to walk. And while it does work in and out of order, as often ambient music can,  Glass Gallery  does reveal itself quite beautifully in its intended sequence. Where much instrumental music tends to unfold in a crescendo, Schofield resists the impulse and instead offers something closer to an abatement, peaking around mid-album track ""Travertine Museum"" before softly landing with closer ""Key of Klee."" Because of this, the album does actually work rather nicely when sequenced back-to-front for those looking for a more traditional listening experience. Ultimately,  Glass Gallery  marks a very confident step forward from Schofield's debut,  Water Sine , while hinting toward even more creativity just bubbling under the still surface.

2021-02-02,Charlie McQuaid,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Black Country, New Road Live Up to the Hype on 'For the first time'",,"Black Country, New Road  have been building their idiosyncratic brand for the past couple of years: legendary live performances at vaunted south London venue the Windmill,  curious merch choices  that included jigsaw puzzles and USB sticks,  music videos built from surreal stock images , and Christmas covers of Wham! and Mariah Carey with Black Midi.    The new band, who seem to have arrived fully formed, have already begun to see tantalizing results. With just two singles released,  The Quietus  dubbed them as ""the best band in the entire world."" Their pre-loved singles have been exchanging hands for over £100 ($170), and they were scheduled to appear at prestigious 2020 festivals such as Primavera, Glastonbury and SXSW. Hype can be dangerous and the pressure can sometimes be too much — but, thankfully, Black Country, New Road have harnessed the pressure and decided to make a statement with their debut LP,  For the first time . And wow, what a statement.    The sound of Black Country, New Road could be described as the merging of post-rock soundscapes with jazz-inflected post-punk, but the nature of the band means it's hard to pinpoint the exact impression. The meshing of classically trained and self-taught players adds depth to the band's sound, creating a unique concoction of precise technical skill and raw, almost primal passion, leading to an unpredictable instrumental delight.    Although Black Country, New Road's music is largely instrumental, when the witty lyrics of Issac Wood come to the fore, attention sharply shifts to the lead guitarist and vocalist. References abound: he name-drops contemporaries like Squid, Black Midi, Fat White Family and Jerskin Fendrix, but most of the references are unfiltered testimonials from his anxiety-ridden life.    Every statement or elliptical narrative should belong in a niche Twittersphere, since they're begging to be accompanied by ironic hashtags. In ""Science Fair"" Wood moves from ""one micro-influencer to another."" In the bands most popular and colossal song, ""Sunglasses,"" Wood speaks to his fellow Zoomers with a rousing call: ""Leave Kanye out of this / Leave your sertraline in the cabinet / I'm more than adequate / Leave my daddy's job out of this."" He is a product of an anxiety-inducing society and a forever switched-on lifestyle, and his lyrics are characterized by the level of hyper-awareness that he and so many of his Gen Z peers possess. Whether intended or not, he nudges you to ask questions: questions of your lifestyle choices, your scrolling habits, your relationships, your upbringing and your future.    The intensity of the album is formed through unsettling vocals, harrowing crescendos, pinches of jazz, klezmer and wild flurries of Arabic rhythms. In the penultimate song, ""Track X"", the band — also including saxophonist Lewis Evans, keyboardist May Kershaw, drummer Charlie Wayne, guitarist Luke Mark, bassist Tyler Hyde and violinist Georgia Ellery — unfurl a sense of poignancy and tenderness through rich melodies and gentle vocal harmonies. It gives the listener a chance to reflect before the chaotic closing track, ""Opus.""    The band's relationship with the digital world may be the only thing holding this album back from true greatness. Four of the six songs are widely available online through releases or live performances available online — so fans won't be hearing most of  For the first time  for the first time. At only six tracks long, this is really just an expensive EP with a nagging lack of new material. On the other hand, Slint — who Black Country, New Road are correctly and constantly being compared to — showed with  Spiderland  that six tracks can be enough. But, unlike Slint, BCNR live in a digital and content-heavy world where expectations of quantity are sometimes demanded.     For the first time  isn't just anxious 22-year-olds making music for other anxious 22-year-olds; it's a raw reflection of the society we've become and the society what we're growing into. It's a capsule of songs written during the band's first 18 months together. It's an honest portrayal of where the band stand at this time — and even that is evolving. Wood has constantly been tinkering with his vocals and lyrics, and previously released singles appear in tweaked form on the album. The band have no interest in repetition, and we can only wonder what will come next. Progression is inevitable and, if Black Country, New Road's honesty and old-fashioned virtuosity continues, we could be witnessing the emergence of a generation-defining band.

2021-02-02,Tom Piekarski,7,"MODERN COMPOSITION,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Quatuor Bozzini Pay Fitting Tribute to a Key Experimental Figure on 'Alvin Lucier: Navigations',,"Montréal-based string quartet  Quatuor Bozzini  have been a mainstay in the Canadian classical music scene for over two decades. Favouring the avant-garde end of the musical spectrum, the quartet has been unafraid of suffusing playful and inventive interpretations throughout a repertoire dedicated to experimentation. Off the heels of 2020's buoyant  Ana Sokolović: Short Stories , Quatuor Bozzini pare things down with  Alvin Lucier: Navigations , an ode to the quartet's relationship with the titular American composer and his material.    This collection of five tracks recorded in concert is timely, as  Alvin Lucier 's reputation has been crystallizing as of late. A contemporary of minimalist pioneers and a towering figure of experimental and contemporary classical music in his own right, Lucier and his recent work have been celebrated anew by labels like Oren Ambarchi's Black Truffle Records.    Quatuor Bozzini's collection is a welcome addition to the attention on Lucier, especially given this release's focus on some of the composer's lesser-known works for string quartet. While Lucier's most applauded pieces tend towards less conventional instruments, the quartet succeed in conveying his interest in relationships between the acoustic phenomena of a place and the instruments and amplification systems around. ""Disappearances"" announces what we should expect from Lucier when composing for strings; a deep respect for the power of a sustained string. The piece utilizes unison violin and cello tones to gradually bring out the characteristics of the room. Two versions of ""Group Tapper"" are highlights, as they display the sonic variety that can be had when all four players are tapping the bodies of their respective instruments in a different place and at different tempos.    Listeners with only a passing familiarity with Lucier's work might detect layers of conceptual baggage in the quartet's performance, but it is important to note that the best results are achieved if one assumes that Lucier is trying to lay as bare as possible the sonic characteristics of the materials that performers have at their disposal. Whether a recording was made in the composer's bedroom or in a concert hall, featuring the bowing of a violin or a brain's alpha waves rendered audible, the substance of Lucier's work often is in the particulars of an interaction. Quatuor Bozzini's release is an occasion to celebrate what is ultimately the fearless act of letting the sounds of one's world ring naked for others to hear.

2021-02-02,Daryl Keating,7,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Madlib's 'Sound Ancestors' Is a Well-Assorted Bag of Aural Treats,,"Depending on what musical circles you identify with,  Madlib  might sound familiar as a background character. ""Oh, isn't he behind the music of  Madvillain ?"" ""Didn't he work with Kanye?"" ""Was there an album he did with J Dilla?""    The answer to all of those, of course, is yes, but to any fan of instrumental hip-hop, he's much much more than someone in shadows. You'd be hard pressed to find a more legendary beatmaker, and there are simply none around who are as eclectic as Madlib. So, for some who might see  Sound Ancestors  as Freddie Gibbs' producer making a solo venture, this is really just another statement from an artist who stands just as tall on his own.    It's very difficult to talk about Madlib without name-drops damaging the page like an airstrike. He has just collaborated with too many heavy-hitters to count — and don't even get us started on his aliases, unless you have a free 20 minutes. There is one more name to let fall, before we proceed though, and it's a relevant one.    When rumours of a new Madlib album first started circulating in December of last year, they came from what seemed like a strange source. British producer  Four Tet  (a.k.a. Kieran Hebden)  tweeted, ""I've made an album with Madlib,"" and some confusion ensued . Four Tet and Madlib sound nothing alike, so the initial perplexity was warranted, but on closer inspection, they are both fanatic crate diggers, and, most importantly, they've been friends for nearly 20 years. It was actually Hebden who convinced Madlib to make  Sound Ancestors , which is billed as his first truly solo album. The thought, it seems, had never really occurred to Madlib.     So, Hebden got to work editing, arranging, and mastering what was to become  Sound Ancestors , culled from a huge body of Madlib's work. Despite this mammoth task, this is probably a source of disgruntlement for some who heard the initial news, because though we definitely have Hebden to thank for this album, it is by no means a Four Tet record. Anyone hoping to hear a nice blend of rarefied hip hop beats and soaring, technicolour club tracks, will sadly be disappointed.    Not that anyone should be disappointed with  Sound Ancestors ; it's a well-assorted bag of aural treats. On here you'll find a cross-section of every musical avenue that Madlib has traversed throughout his career. Fans of  Blunted In The Bomb Shelter  will be glad to hear the reggae-leaning ""Theme De Crabtree,"" while anyone who was more into his jazz explorations like  Shades of Blue  can happily find a home on tracks like ""One for Quartabê / Right Now"" and ""Sound Ancestors.""    It's almost, but not quite, diversity to a fault. You do need to have a very broad musical taste to enjoy every facet of this record. It morphs through every shape that instrumental hip-hop can take, but where Madlib really shines is in his use of soul music. ""Road of the Lonely Ones,"" which features a sample from Philly group the Ethics, will send you floating upon first listen, and the finely chopped vocal cuts of ""Two for 2 – For Dilla"" are just alabaster smooth.     Sound Ancestors  is a mixed bag if ever there was one. It's funky, it's psychedelic, it's jazzy, dirty, clean, and mean. It's Madlib.

2021-02-03,Luke Pearson,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC",John Carpenter Brings Irony-Free Confidence to Loveable Horror Cheese on 'Lost Themes III: Alive After Death',,"Continuing his late-career resurgence as a creative musical force, famed horror director/composer  John Carpenter  has released his third album of free-standing original music,  Lost Themes III: Alive After Death . A collection of original scores for films that don't actually exist, the series offers the fun of imagining all the standard horror imagery from the Carpenter-verse its music could accompany: moonlit suburban streets awash in fog, creepy graveyards, even the signature Albertus typeface Carpenter used for all his credits — a sort of free-associative fugue of '80s horror tropes (developed and codified to no small degree by Carpenter himself of course). While this third entry could be classified as largely more of the same, there's enough freshness here to warrant a closer look, especially if you're already a fan of the project.    The most energizing addition to Carpenter's sound this time around (well-judged krautrock elements dominated previously, and remain here to a somewhat lesser extent) is an appealing synthwave element that creeps into a couple of tracks, especially the excellent ""Weeping Ghost."" Opening with a steady beat and the album's most memorable synth line, — and clearly meant as something of a calling card in the album's two spot — it immediately brings the album to life, confirming that Carpenter has basically been composing proto-synthwave all along. (His trademark single-note sixteenths — you know them — basically paved the way for the entire genre.) It's something of a pity, then, that beyond one other agreeably pulsing moment, Carpenter largely sticks to his usual bag of tricks here, perhaps missing a certain knock at the door.    It's always worthwhile hearing more of his lush and evocative horror themes, however, and we are once again given helpfully imagistic titles like ""Dripping Blood,"" ""Skeleton,"" and ""Cemetery"" to help us along. Some stand out more than others. The plucked strings of ""Dripping Blood"" add nicely to its swooning atmosphere, for instance (a neat mix of the pastoral and sinister that sounds like it belongs in a zombie version of  The Princess Bride ). The lush organs of ""Dead Walk"" conjure some kind of undead ball, bejewelled masks resting against rotting flesh. The irony-free confidence that Carpenter brings to sounds that in other contexts might be derided as cliché (cheesy atmospherics and rompler synth presets that have largely gone out of style) remains appealing here — the kind of assurance only a true stylistic progenitor can bring.    Some sections sound a bit under-realized. Carpenter is on record saying that his creative process with collaborators Daniel Davies and son Cody Carpenter often involves starting with a promising theme and adding layers as they proceed, and although hardly an unorthodox approach, its ad hoc nature shows in the material sometimes, with tracks losing direction, or ending abruptly after building towards something that sounded promising. (""Vampire's Touch"" is an example of the latter.)    Even so, fans of Carpenter's recent return, and anyone with a slew of slasher movies in their queue, will still find plenty of bone-chilling fun on  Lost Themes III: Alive After Death .

2021-02-03,Urbi Khan,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Odette Comes of Age on 'Herald',,"Australian singer-songwriter  Odette  soars in her sophomore release with  Herald . Throughout the album's 11-tracks, she explores themes of love, identity and heartbreak through a self-critical and personal lens, like diary entries to her present self. Informed by her mixed identity with British and Zulu heritage,  Herald  is a coming-of-age album, where she sheds her past self and creates the new out of the ashes.      Herald  displays growth from Odette's equally confessional debut album, 2018's  To a Stranger . Unlike her previous album,  Herald  longs less for what once was and what could have been, instead focusing on what is happening in the present. Odette still yearns on tracks like ""What I Know Is Not Enough"" and ""Foghorn,"" but with hope for a better future, while ""I Miss You, I'm Sorry"" and ""Amends"" finds her releasing the toxicity of adolescence.    Sonically, the album takes flight with orchestral strings, brass and woodwind arrangements intertwined with electronic elements. While  Herald  largely sits in line with other rising bedroom pop artists like Joy Crookes, Arlo Parks and Celeste, the album also makes bold experiments that pay off. Spoken-word track ""Feverbreak,"" featuring the Australian electronic duo Hermitude, recalls the work of rapper Kae Tempest, while sound collage of ""Amends"" includes found sounds of insects and magpies, giving the track a perfect Aussie touch.     On  Herald , Odette embraces life's highs and the lows, all for the sake of the song.

2021-02-03,Matt Bobkin,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Cheekface Turn Doomscrolling into a Dance Party on 'Emphatically No.',,"There's a line from  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines  that I invoke often when talking about the role of therapy in my life: ""I should have realized our destiny was never to stop Judgment Day; it was merely to survive it."" Therapy isn't meant to cure our problems, but to teach us how to coexist with them. I imagine, then, that my oft-desired inner peace would probably sound a lot like the music of  Cheekface . The LA-based pop-rock trio are acutely aware of society's many ails and crises, but instead of trying to either lead the revolution or ignore it completely, their music is a coping mechanism in and of itself that keeps the problems front and centre without letting them win.    Cheekface pack every tune with a bombardment of sharp hooks and even sharper lyrics, with the lyrical oeuvre of an old-school Facebook status highlight reel come to life. With lines like ""The climate changed and I left it on read"" and ""Of course I relate to Lena Dunham, I relate to every annoying genius,"" the album's best moments are self-aggrandizing self-owns that explore millennial ennui, helplessness and corporate disenfranchisement, set to a series of equally brisk and punchy power-pop tracks that turn doomscrolling into a rockin' dance party. Filtered through Greg Katz's disaffected speak-singing, which sounds like Jonathan Richman after a trip through the Total Perspective Vortex, Cheekface come off like Parquet Courts' snarkier younger sibling (and that's saying something) or the Dismemberment Plan with the edges shaved off, taking both bands' impossible mixes of sardonic and confrontational and giving it the clearest mix possible.     Emphatically No.  is less an album than a collection of singles, of which half were released regularly during the two years since Cheekface's 2019 debut,  Therapy Island . Each track pumps out a parade of riffs, hooks and quips in mostly three minutes or less, with remarkably consistent quality. (Though none are able to hit the sprint of  Therapy Island  crown jewel ""Eternity Leave,"" which blitzes through all of that plus airhorns in 93 seconds.)  Emphatically No.  takes the best moments of its predecessor and cuts out all the fat, of which there was little to begin with. What the new album's songs lack in variety, they make up for in sheer infectiousness, with the trio's air-tight arrangements and Katz's barrage of quotable one-liners enough to drive each track home.    And it is most certainly a barrage — by the time the impact of a zinger like ""Phone call from 'Unknown,' I answer just to have someone to talk to"" or ""I never 'don't panic' so I always 'don't try'"" subsides, it's been followed up by another equally biting line. Songs aren't differentiated by vibe or gimmick, but by the scorching lyrics and indelible earworms. Like the 24-hour news cycle, it's unrelenting, but the band's hook-heavy formula provide the balloons to keep the lyrics' heart-wrenching anchors from weighing things down too much.     The band spell out their ethos in the chorus of  Emphatically No. 's opening track, an on-its-face uplifting plea to ""Listen to your heart / Keep on keeping on / Just say no to drugs / Eat a healthy lunch,"" undermined by the rest of the band shouting out a dry 'no' between every line. It's only more sour from there, but even amid lyrics like ""Everything is okay, got my old phone replaced / Now I do nothing faster than I did yesterday"" and ""I come from a long line of people / A long line of people who procreated,"" there's an underlying peace of mind over needing to take a dance break every once in a while.    Cheekface's songwriting core are industry lifers you've probably never heard of — vocalist Greg Katz is an artist manager, label owner and university lecturer, while bassist Amanda Tannen was a member of onetime-'00s buzz band  stellastarr*  before settling into a career as an art director and graphic designer (she also designs Cheekface's art, all of which looks similar to the album cover above). They've distilled their lifetimes of experience into a series of wry missives that are jubilant enough to bop along to but cutting enough as to make the return to reality smoother. By constantly invoking markers of escapism and consciousness,  Emphatically No.  wrings as much fun as possible out of decidedly not-fun times.

2021-02-04,Sam Boer,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The Staves Branch Out with Their Hearts Intact on 'Good Woman',,"It was quite a year. Between the death of their grandmother and mother, a bad breakup, a pregnancy, and an unprecedented reckoning with their identity as a band,  the Staves  (composed of sisters Emily, Jessica and Camilla Staveley-Taylor) spent 2018 in mourning, in celebration, and — more than anything else — in solidarity. Not much afterwards, the sisters found themselves committing to record another album, reckoning with still-open wounds and ripe insecurities while crafting their first full-length in several years. The result is  Good Woman , an album that's alternately direct and cryptic, musically divergent, and — though not remarkable — a heartfelt statement.    Over a decade, the Staves have evolved from a humble folk trio — performing at open mic nights in their hometown of Watford, England — to a dynamic folk-rock force, touring with the likes of Justin Vernon (who produced their remarkable 2015 album,  If I Was ), Florence + the Machine, and First Aid Kit. While their most recent collaborative project, 2017's hypnotic  The Way Is Read  with chamber ensemble yMusic, saw the Staves stretching their boundaries into the experimental sphere,  Good Woman  finds the Staves depending upon pop hooks and synthetic touches to elevate anthems of sorrow and yearning. Developed through a deeply collaborative partnership with veteran producer John Congleton,  Good Woman 's fully fleshed-out sound does elevate many of the album's peaks, though it also compromises the deep vulnerability that such emotional subject matter deserves.    This is not to say there isn't deep feeling in  Good Woman . The title track, for instance, is a lash against bullshit gender expectations; there is a power in a trio of sisters' voices uniting, overcoming both the external pressures and internalized prescriptions of what constitutes womanhood, and moving from the self-conscious ""Be kind / I'm a good woman"" to the more assertive: ""I feel as though / I'm a good woman."" ""Best Friend"" is a delightful, nostalgic portrait of naïve friendship, and amidst the bluntly self-deprecating ""Failure,"" the Staves sing this tongue-in-cheek chorus: ""Nobody wants to sing with me / Nothing left to bring to me anymore, and I know why / So high five."" It's so casual that it's striking, an ironic twist that hit hard, a staple of the Staves' songwriting since 2012's similarly self-flagellatory ""Pay Us No Mind."" Most of the moments that feels hit home on  Good Woman  aren't confronting death or disintegrating relationships directly; rather, they're nostalgic reflections and inner conflicts.    Musically,  Good Woman  is at its best when it's just right: not totally pop, not using folk as a crutch, and not trying too hard to experiment. The unremarkably arranged, cliché-laden ""Satisfied"" is the best argument against a pure-pop Staves, and the adventurous, free-form ""Trying"" is engaging, but feels out of place on this record. All of these areas converge on album highlight ""Paralysed,"" in which the Staves begin acoustic and explode into an ambience-tinged indie-rock climax, insisting: ""I used to be magic, I used to be rage uncontained."" It sounds like something ruptured, and sense has given way to pure feeling, with all the grief and confusion of a tumultuous year balled into a fleeting moment.    While  Good Woman  is not the most notable stop on the Staves' journey, it retains all of their most delectable elements — heart-hitting harmonies, lovely melodies, and moments of lyrical spark — that have come to define their work. The Staves are, thankfully, still very much the Staves, and  Good Woman  is a good listen.

2021-02-08,Leslie Ken Chu,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",slowthai Breaks Down All Sides of Himself on 'TYRON',,"Northampton rapper  slowthai  made his name with his 2019 debut,  Nothing Great About Britain . No surprise, the ""Brexit Bandit"" incurred criticism from British nationalists for his flaming indictment of his home country. His aggressive musical style and onstage antics, whether motivated by politics or humour, didn't help his reputation.    But slowthai's latest album,  TYRON , goes deeper than his grievances against Britain. With help from guests Dominic Fike,  Denzel Curry  and Kwes Darko, to name a few, slowthai has delivered a follow-up that shows Tyron Frampton, the person behind the artist, in full relief.     TYRON 's first half features a barrage of quaking grime and drill slammers. Song titles spelled in all caps reflect this opening suite's familiar energy. Even though slowthai drops lines like ""The whole world is mine!"" on ""45 SMOKE,"" all his flexing comes off like a performance, harmless fun. But as this half moves along, it quickly becomes clear it's not all fun. Don't be fooled by the flutes on ""CANCELLED"" — the grim track is an outright challenge to slowthai's critics, as  Skepta  throws down: ""Show me your face / Let me see who's really tryna stop me / I pay the price / Don't care what it cost."" On ""MAZZA,"" slowthai and  A$AP Rocky  discuss self-doubt, drug reliance and how unfulfilled they feel, no matter how much money they bank.    Rap ballads, with titles spelled in lowercase, dominate  TYRON 's second half. On ""i tried,"" slowthai bottoms out. ""I've got a sickness that I'm dealing with / Feels like I'm sinking all of the time,"" he confesses. The song deflates after that line, matching slowthai's defeated attitude. ""i tried"" is  TYRON 's turning point, where he realizes the pomp he's known for isn't the real him; at the very least, it's not the  full  him. ""adhd"" and ""focus"" also reflect these sentiments: ""Smile on the out, but on the inside I keep bleeding / Fun and games till you gotta take the blame,"" goes the former. And on the latter: ""Mr. I Don't Give a Shit / Seems like I always did.""    slowthai has also learned to take life as it comes — here, he accepts that some things are out of his control. On ""terms,"" he sings, ""I woke up and came to terms with it / No matter what, they get my words twisted / Whatever works / It could be worse / Shit could be worse."" ""feel away,"" featuring  James Blake  and  Mount Kimbie , is slowthai's most ascendant song and  TYRON 's greatest standout, but ""nhs"" is the album's thematic centrepiece. Over a melancholic piano line, he rap-sings about the natural cycles of yin and yang: ""What's a flight without turbulence?"" This perspective helps him live in the moment.    slowthai is learning to shed distractions and detriments from his life. He's quit drinking, for one. He's focusing on living in the moment and not taking any experience for granted. But he knows that sometimes, there's no peace without turmoil. As the tender Deb Never feature on ""push"" goes, ""The calm comes after the storm / Sit back and watch the rain / Breathe out before tomorrow / Slow down before you break and you're cast aside."" On  TYRON , slowthai sounds more together and present than ever.

As vulnerable and soft as she is strong and powerful, the Peruvian-Canadian artist sings about her life without censoring herself, exposing her inner doubts and exploring her troubled teenage years.    Opening with ""Demo,"" Beko goes into explaining how she often has to comply with the tastes and current trends of the music industry to be taken seriously. Yet, her album is exactly not what you would expect from any mainstream artist. Every song is delivered with a strong punch that hits listeners in the gut, almost as if she wanted everyone to share in her past pain and experiences.    Beko bares it all. Her voice is powerful, resonating throughout while following the beat and the rhythm of every one of her songs without skimping out on emotion. Her delivery is heartfelt. Every line she sings reflects her state of mind. Assisted by appearances from other Quebecois artists (Rymz on ""Party"" and Karelle on ""Alma""), the album tells Beko's unique story of loneliness, fear and risk.    Produced by Beau Geste,  BLUE  is one of those gems straight out of Montreal's hip-hop scene that Beko is making a well-deserved place in. She delves into her pain in ""Alma,"" she speaks of being a high schooler in New York in ""MHS,"" and openly talks about her relationship with depression and substances in ""Salute."" Though some songs break the flow of her album — ""Ukulele,"" is a more uplifting track in its musical composition, juxtaposed with sad lyrics —  BLUE  is still an impressive album from a promising hip-hop artist on the rise.    The album's closing track, ""Weird,"" leaves a lasting impact. Beko wonders what a 15-year-old girl thinks at night before going to bed — she imagines her having a crush, getting high and experiencing what a teenager thinks ""love"" is. The song explores the fears of teenagers too, fears that linger into adulthood, especially the fear of always being alone. Beko revisits her own experiences as a teenager, but it's easy for listeners to relate too.     BLUE  establishes Beko as one of Montreal's brightest hip-hop artists who should be followed in the years to come. She shines in this first release and gives us an excellent and raw debut.

2021-01-26,Rhys Juergensen,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",BAND-MAID Begin Their Evolution into Japanese Rock Breakouts on 'Unseen World',,"It's been a good decade for heavy music in Japan, but while many of these acts have been enjoying success in Japan and Europe, very few have taken off in North America. You may have heard of  BABYMETAL , the band that brought kawaii metal to the world (and became the first Asian act to top Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart), but the vast majority have yet to cross the pond.     You'd be forgiven, then, for never having heard of  BAND-MAID . Despite releasing seven records in seven years, touring the world, and hitting the UK charts twice (topping out at No. 4), they've never had any presence in North America. The quintet, founded by guitarist and backup vocalist Miku Kobato, dress in stage garb based on the type of outfit Kobato wore during her time working in a Japanese maid café.     BAND-MAID's hard rock is a mix of bass-heavy punk, garage metal and pop rock. With their latest record,  Unseen World , the band largely keep to their formula and deliver head-banging, high-voltage music that's perfect for hitting the highway with the windows rolled down and the volume turned up to 11.     Bassist MISA outdoes herself. She slaps out complex, technical lines like Flea, but pushes her tone into more gainy, heavy territory. She leads ""NO GOD,"" the Motörhead-esque second track, with a nonstop, maximum-attack bass line that breaks out into an eruption of a solo right before the song's culmination. Drummer Akane Hirose fills up the album with an airtight freight train of percussion that incorporates a hint of double-kick, Dave Grohl-esque hand-foot combos, and prog-rock patterns. The vocals, led by Saiku Atsumi and backed by Kobato, absolutely soar in the choruses; in a few songs, Atsumi throws in a sing-rap verse over one of MISA's signature basslines, Chili Peppers style.    Highlight track ""MANNERS"" takes all these elements and arranges them in a near-perfect form, resulting in a four-minute trance of clean vocal hooks, sneering guitar riffs, and chugging percussion that will push your stereo to its limit.     While the album does largely stay true to BAND-MAID's signature sound, a few songs branch out into unexplored territory. The closing track, ""BLACK HOLE,"" ticks all the BAND-MAID boxes while pushing every element to new extremes. The chorus reaches higher echelons of thrash, the verse reaches new levels of bass-punk attitude, and the bridge is filled with charismatic guitar and vocal riffs. The song, in many ways, represents the band beginning to realize their potential.     BAND-MAID's newfound range makes  Unseen World  a great album for new listeners, for its approachable-yet-dynamic side can (and will) get anyone hooked, while its more distinctive side showcases the emerging niche the band are making for themselves.     There are other acts in Japan — such as Gacharic Spin and DOLL$BOXX — that have far more adventurous takes on hard rock, and deliver them with more character. But where these acts venture dangerously close to becoming gimmicky, BAND-MAID stay earnest. The quintet are still developing their sound, but  Unseen World  resembles the beginnings of the personal stamp they're about to establish on the genre.

2021-01-27,Manus Hopkins,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Tribulation Cement Their Status as Heavy Metal Frontrunners on 'Where the Gloom Becomes Sound',,"Black metal is one of the most prolific metal styles in the world, but its general musical inaccessibility prevents it from being embraced by the mainstream metal world, save for a handful of bands like Dimmu Borgir and Carach Angren. Enter  Tribulation  — this Swedish quartet have been at it since 2005, and in that time have released five studio albums, two EPs and a live record. They've been on an upward trajectory for a while, seeming one right move away from becoming a true household name. Their latest release,  Where the Gloom Becomes Sound,  is unquestionably the record this band needs to cement their status as frontrunners in 21st-century heavy metal.    Rather than rehashing old clichés, Tribulation blaze a new trail by combining sinister, ethereal black metal sounds with hard rock riffs, making them more palatable to new black metal listeners. While Johannes Andersson's eerie vocals are as haunting as any underground screecher's and Oscar Leander's cymbal-heavy drumming has imprints of early black metal all over it, there's an abundance of musical hooks that set these songs apart without sacrificing the black metal feel Tribulation have worked hard to keep intact.    Songs like the versatile ""Hour of the Wolf,"" the monumental ""Leviathans,"" the immensely catchy ""Funeral Pyre"" and riveting finale ""The Wilderness"" exemplify the expertise of the band's song-crafting abilities — seamlessly blending harshness, bleakness and melody into unique, memorable tunes.     Tribulation's hopeful rise isn't coming without its bumps in the road. In the midst of the promotion for this record, it was announced that it would be the last Tribulation effort with founding guitarist Jonathan Hultén, who would be exiting the band to move on to new endeavours. While a replacement is already in place and there appears to be no bad blood between the musicians, this is a difficult loss for Tribulation, especially seeing as Hultén wrote the majority of this album. This, of course, isn't to discount the importance of other members, but fans will agree that visually, musically and sonically, Hultén was an integral part of Tribulation's music and performances.     Where the Gloom Becomes Sound  is a momentous record, but the question as to whether they can follow it up without one crucial member will linger until that day comes.

2021-01-27,Max Heilman,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",The Body Harness the Heart of Darkness on Pulverizing 'I've Seen All I Need to See',,"Even without counting  the Body 's plethora of  collaborative   efforts , much of this Rhode Island duo's output has a stacked guest list. The most memorable moments of the band's 22-year career wouldn't exist without guitarist/vocalist Chip King and drummer/programmer Lee Buford joining forces with talents such as Lingua Ignota and the Assembly of Light Choir. The Body's penchant for exploration and collaboration makes their return to primitive sludge metal note-worthy in and of itself — but that's only one facet of  I've Seen All I Need to See . This is a band rediscovering their roots in the depths of pandemonium.    It's refreshing to hear the Body spotlight their core instrumentation, with only sparse input from long-time contributors Chrissy Wolpert (Assembly of Light Choir) and vocalist Ben Eberle (Sandworm). Opener ""A Lament"" displays King and Buford's uncompromising approach. The grating, blown-out guitar and drum tones would be oppressive enough without the track abruptly cutting in and out, like rhythmic power outages in a collapsing factory. Luminous synth patches manage to shine through the pulverizing tumult, retaining the Body's atmospheric edge.    These 40 minutes truly seem like Buford and King went to engineer Seth Manchester and said, ""let's try to convince everyone we recorded with moldy potatoes."" King's vocal impression of a parrot burning alive has somehow become the least disconcerting sound at play, as ""Tied Up and Locked In"" and ""A Pain of Knowing"" blur the line between sludge metal and straight-up harsh noise. The former's pulsating muck and industrial rhythms get swept away by utter cacophony, while the latter's smouldering dronescape entirely disregards structure.    Though certainly hard to digest,  I've Seen All I Need to See 's corrosive hostility imparts creative liberty to match its punishing crudeness. Whether it's the modular synth mutations that punctuate the oozing distortion of ""They Are Coming,"" or the inexplicable swing groove underpinnings of ""Eschatological Imperative,"" each track rears an ugly, but strangely memorable, head. A sense of direction pervades within the sonic torture chambers. Panicked screams and barbaric drumming spur the monolithic riffs along the road to hell.    In spite of their self-imposed limitations, the Body traverse sonic territory as diverse as it is caustic. This keeps deep cuts like ""The Handle/The Blade"" interesting, as King's signature falsetto squawk weaves into the propulsive rhythm breaks like an added layer of feedback. To a similar effect, ""The City Is Shelled"" presents a cavalcade of atonal piano chords, dissonant anti-riffs and disfigured beats, leaving ""Path of Failure"" to conclude the album with a haunting collage of free-form drum solos and throbbing power electronics.    Stripped-down in concept, and impenetrable in execution,  I've Seen All I Need to See  is perhaps the purest summation of the Body's artistry. Harnessing the core of their heart of darkness, King and Buford continue to blaze trails with immersive antipathy.

2021-01-27,Matt Bobkin,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",'The Besnard Lakes Are the Last of the Great Thunderstorm Warnings' Is Absurdly Maximalist,,"Pop quiz: how many of  the Besnard Lakes ' first five albums are double LPs? Appreciators of the Montreal outfit's maximalist psych-rock voyages may answer something like ""three"" or ""four,"" which, while plausible, would be completely wrong. For all their orchestral ambition, previous efforts have never hit the 50-minute mark, managing to pack full worlds of instruments, concepts and atmosphere into a single slab of wax.    They finally give in to impulse on epic-as-it-sounds  The Besnard Lakes Are the Last of the Great Thunderstorm Warnings , which stretches nine tracks across an 72-minute meditation on death, dying and the afterlife. It's a weighty, demanding listen, but the band's 18-year history has given them plenty of experience that helps them pull it off in classic Besnard Lakes style.    Anyone with a passing understanding of the Besnard Lakes knows what to expect by this point, and the band double down on the densely textured, mid-tempo psychedelia that has long been their trademark. Scorching guitar solos, Jace Lasek's immutable falsetto, Olga Goreas' icy vocals, synths piercing the low-end fog — all of these staples are given lots of airtime. The album's extended length lets each moment breathe, and the band make great work of the many lengthy buildups, taking their time as the tracks grow into commanding crescendos, largely delivering on their promise of surround-sound, all-systems-go payoff.    As with nearly all double LPs, it can be a trying listen. The negligible swell of ""Christmas Can Wait"" is the psych rock equivalent of waiting for a dubstep drop that never comes, while late-album palate cleanser ""The Dark Side of Paradise"" lulls with an extended outro that turns the drum loop intro of ""New Revolution"" into an abrupt wake-up call from an accidental nap. But the waits are most often worth it thanks to some of the band's most ebullient climaxes to date, like the multiple guitar attacks of ""The Father of Time Wakes Up"" and the title drop during the album's 17-minute closer, ""Are the Last of the Great Thunderstorm Warnings."" (Hearing Lasek absolutely sell such a grandiose phrase while singing at the top of the lungs is both bone-chilling and pretty hilarious, in a hair metal, so-cheesy-it's-great kind of way.)    Infusing the melodic gauntlets of  Are the Dark Horse  and  Are the Roaring Night  with the ambient strengths of  Until in Excess, Imperceptible UFO ,  Thunderstorm Warnings  has many fun moments to discover over repeated listens as attention spans will inevitably drift in and out, like the Beatlesian sway of ""Our Heads, Our Hearts on Fire Again,"" the rocketlike guitars of ""Feuds with Guns,"" or the synth freakout on ""New Revolution.""    Wisely abandoning the dissonant switch-ups of 2016's  A Coliseum Complex Museum ,  Thunderstorm Warnings  takes everything the Besnard Lakes have ever done well and provides it in abundance. There's nothing here that they haven't done before, but no one else has ever come close to encroaching on the band's niche of colliding intrepid Rush and King Crimson-style prog with the atmosphere of Montreal's storied post-rock scene, so why change now?

2021-01-27,Daryl Keating,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Vancouver's Yu Su Makes IDM and Ambient Magic on Debut Album 'Yellow River Blue',,"Following a winter tour of mainland China in 2019, Vancouver-based, Kaifeng-born artist  Yu Su  decided to start a label and make an album.  Yellow River Blue , named after the world's most heavily salted river, is an album of firsts: it's a debut LP for Yu Su and the inaugural release of her newly-founded bié Records.    As debuts go, this one is striking. It would be hard to believe that such depth could come from a first try, so it's no surprise to find that Yu Su has had a toe dipped in the proverbial salted river for a few years now. Fans of Vancouver's now-dormant  1080p  label might recognize her skills from the  You're Me  project, which she co-wrote with Scott Johnson Gailey back in 2016.    As great as those releases were, Yu Su works even better on her own.  Yellow River Blue  is only eight tracks long, but within them lie myriad textures, moods, and techniques. And when we say within them, we don't just mean the album as a whole; there's a multitude of layers to every single track.    ""Futuro"" is a shapeshifting, eerie take on dub. It's only dub in the mildest sense, shown through Yu Su's thoroughly unique lens. It's a common theme that's found throughout  Yellow River Blue , where she offers something almost familiar, but has refracted it just enough so that you're still not entirely sure what you're hearing. ""Gleam,"" for example, has all the kicks and clicks of a techno track but then again it's oh-so-soft. Conversely, ""Klein"" plays like an astral nosedive into an ancient wormhole, and yet even an out-there song like that will have you bobbing before you're spat out the other side.     In this sense, Yu Su is a true magician. Nothing is quite as it seems in her world. You may think you've gotten the lay of the land, but then the land morphs right in front of you, and all of a sudden you're lost, albeit happily lost.    Tying ambient soundscapes, borderline IDM and subtle snapshots of traditional music into a coherent, yet distinctive, body of work, this auspicious debut forecasts a promising future for Yu Su. Anyone would be happy to hop in a boat and sail these waters for hours and hours.

2021-01-27,Alex Hudson,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",'OK Human' Proves Why Weezer Are Still One of the Most Interesting Rock Bands Around,,"In case you tuned out sometime around 2005's  Make Believe , let's get you up to speed.  Weezer  have quietly and steadily become one of the most interesting bands in modern rock, amassing an unpredictable catalogue full of wild misfires (2017's  Pacific Daydream ), striking returns to form (2016's  White Album ) and divisive pop experiments (2019's  Black Album ). Unlike almost any other band 15 albums into their career, it still feels like Weezer are capable of making either a masterpiece or a complete stinker — mostly depending on whatever mood frontman  Rivers Cuomo  happens to be in on a given day.    So here we are with  OK Human , an album that once again rewrites the Weezer playbook, this time by abandoning electric guitars in favour of an all-acoustic setup, analogue recording gear and a 38-piece orchestra.    Ignoring the fact that a pandemic is the worst time imaginable to record with a 38-piece orchestra,  OK Human  is one of the best instalments in the band's post-millennium catalogue, channeling the soaring hooks of their early days with the stream-of-consciousness lyrical weirdness of more recent albums, and then slathering the whole thing in lavish strings.    The songs are accentuated by orchestrations, but not defined by them. Lead single and opening track ""All My Favourite Songs"" features a bubbly hook and some of Cuomo's most straightforward lyrics in years, as he sings, ""I love parties, but I don't go / Then I feel bad when I stay home / 'Cause I need a friend when I take a walk / I like spacing out when somebody talks.""    Without the roar of electric guitars or the gloss of digital recording equipment, each quaver in Cuomo's voice is exposed. He sells the hell out of every single lyric, from the poignant professions of love on the Old Hollywood-tinged ""Mirror Image"" to the giddy promises of self-improvement on ""Here Comes the Rain."" There's even a song about loving audiobooks, as ""Grapes of Wrath"" features an bizarre bit of product placement in its chorus: ""I'm gonna rock my Audible headphone  Grapes of Wrath ."" It's a natural extension for a geek rock band whose breakthrough single featured the word ""homies"" and then only got dorkier from there.    Not every song is a winner. In particular, ""Play My Piano"" is a little too on the nose with its descriptions of, you guessed it, playing the piano; of all the gleefully clumsy lyrics on  OK Human , that song's ""Kim Jong-un could blow up my city, I'd never know"" is a rare one that truly clunks. ""La Brea Tar Pits"" is the only moment when Weezer get undermined by the orchestra, as the song is swallowed up by syrupy orchestrations better suited to a Pixar film than a power pop album.    But, with 12 tracks and a runtime of barely more than half an hour, any flaws are minor and the album breezes by. The arrangements may be ambitious, but there's very little pomp or grandeur here; this is just another low-stakes success in a long and varied career. And with the metal-inspired  Van Weezer  still due to come out in May, the experiments are going to keep on coming; the next one might suck or it might be amazing, and that's all part of the fun.

Taking the fun a step further, she is now releasing the audio from the concert as a live album. Offering so much more than her studio recordings, the live version overflows with emotion from Dirks as well as the sold-out crowds. This release is Begonia in her rawest state, filled with human moments, funny banter and spunk.     The album includes nearly every song from her 2019 album  Fear  and 2017 EP  Lady in Mind , making the album an ideal starting point for new fans. The album is impressive the first time through, but offers so much more with each listen, especially from her band. The instrumentals and the harmonies are showcased more in a live setting than in the studio, making it full, energetic and wildly colourful. As expected from a live album, Begonia's vocal imperfections come through, which often end up adding an emotional edge. She is known for her passionate voice and she brings it full force with this album, whether singing softly and sensitively or yelling her face off.     The most impressive tracks are ""Two Beers In"" and ""Put It Away,"" which have Begonia's best vocals, awesome harmonies from her back-up singers, and instrumentals that have been amped up for the live performance. ""Two Beers In"" is particularly impactful due to its rhythmic complexity and Dirks' powerful range. These two tracks are not typically among her most popular, but that may very well change after this release — another example of how Dirks elevates her music for the live show.      With electrifying performances from Dirks and her band,  The Fear Tour (Live)  is Begonia at her best, and really makes you feel as if you're in the same room as her, experiencing one of her shows.

2021-01-28,Donald Teplyske,8,"REVIEWS,FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,MUSIC",Maria Dunn Keeps Classic Folk Sounding Fresh on 'Joyful Banner Blazing',,"Contemporary folk music holds a mirror to society and allows consideration of events outside ourselves. A storyteller through song for more than 20 years, Edmonton's Maria Dunn has been drawing on family bonds, social justice, history and interpersonal vignettes to propel her perspective.     Utilizing Celtic folk traditions as inspiration, Dunn — who has received Juno and Canadian Folk Award nominations — channels her creations with intimacy, insight and wonder. Extend a straight line from Hazel & Alice and Shirley Collins to Joan Armatrading and Kirsty MacColl, and you'll arrive at Maria Dunn. Like the finest troubadours, Dunn is the vessel through which others exist, a sense of revelation never too far away.    Modulated, classic approaches prevail on  Joyful Banner Blazing , her seventh album. Shannon Johnson's fiddle offers notes of hope or desperation, depending on the need apparent. The appealing ""Ontario Song"" receives an injection of banjo from Curtis Appleton, and a flavouring of pedal steel from Jeff Bradshaw accents the album's sole cover, an affecting take of Ron Hynes' ""From Dublin with Love.""     Longtime collaborators remain: Johnson (producer, violin), Jeremiah McDade (horns and whistles) and Solon McDade (bass), while Dunn contributes tasteful acoustic guitar and accordion. The prominence of horns — trumpet, saxophone, and trombone — in select spots is refreshing.    Dunn reveals universal connections and innermost insights as well as any artist. She does this with eternally fresh vocals and keen observation, through a variety of moods and tempos with concise, poetic lyrics that remain within tradition while embracing gentle pop flair.    Dunn breathes life into ""beautiful fools"" with whom we emotionally engage. The title track celebrates an aunt's life of service, but also recognizes the youthful foundlings to whom she provided encouragement. ""Secondhand Skates"" speaks to simple pleasures, and a community's pride when a beloved member rises above.     A Dunn recording isn't complete without pro-labour struggles crafted as sing-along; ""Heart in Hand"" captures the turmoil of labour strife, specifically sacrifices made by Edmonton slaughterhouse workers seeking fair measure in the face of Peter Pocklington's avarice.    Whatever her inspiration, Dunn injects songs with personality and conviction. ""Declan's Song (The Good Life),"" ""Don't Think You Are Forgotten,"" and ""Love Carries Me"" are sparkling ruminations of love, remembrance, discovery and gratitude for the bonds of family as we traverse the challenges of daily toil.     Joyful Banner Blazing  is another masterful recording from Canada's traditional folk standard-bearer.

2021-02-01,Alex Hudson,7,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK",Foo Fighters Do What They Do Best on 'Medicine at Midnight',,"Think back on the past decade of  Foo Fighters ' career — what stands out? Maybe it's that time frontman  Dave Grohl  broke his leg and  performed while sitting on a giant throne . Perhaps it's his  viral drum-off challenge  with a 10-year-old kid. Or it might be the band's seemingly endless parade of  festival headlining slots  and  SNL  appearances . Most recently, it was likely their performance at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration.    What probably doesn't stand out, however, is that the band have continued to release albums at a steady clip. Sure, the LPs almost always top the charts and sell hundreds of thousands of copies, but the singles barely register on radio. The albums tend to be more memorable for their gimmicks — 2011's  Wasting Light  was recorded in a garage with analogue gear, 2014's  Sonic Highways  was recorded in eight different cities, etc. — than the actual music. Really, it's all just a way to keep the band on the road, and for Grohl to maintain his status as the most loveable everyman in rock music.    And so here we are  Medicine at Midnight  — the band's fourth album within the past 10 years, and yet another collection of old-school rock music that's satisfying without being adventurous. The Foos aren't trying to reinvent rock, but they're doing a pretty good job at carrying on the tradition.     Medicine at Midnight  was recorded with returning super-producer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Beck), and they've toned things down a little from the stadium-sized mega-rock of 2017's  Concrete and Gold . Instead of pomp and grandeur, these nine songs are all about fun. Opener ""Making a Fire"" froths with faux-Motown soul harmonies and a fidgety 6/8 rhythm that sounds like it's tripping over itself out of sheer enthusiasm; the party carries on all the way to closer ""Loves Dies Young,"" which blends the chug-a-lug of classic rock with a thumping new wave dance beat.    ""Cloudspotter"" and title cut ""Medicine at Midnight"" push the Foo Fighters ever so slightly out of their retro comfort zone with a clickity-clacking percussion loops and deep, crooning vocal performances from Grohl. But for the most part,  Medicine at Midnight  isn't good because of the ways it pushes the envelope, but because of how upholds the band's status as rock torchbearers. This is the Foos doing what they do best.

2021-02-01,Daniel Sylvester,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC,JAZZ",Misc Pull Montreal Jazz into the Future on 'Partager l'ambulance',,"From Maynard Ferguson through Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones, Quebecois jazz has forever paraded a distinct and splendid sound: jaunty, buoyant and groove-filled, but always somehow sophisticated. But with  Misc , that's where the comparisons end. On the follow-up to their 2016 self-titled LP, the Montreal trio — formerly Trio Jérôme Beaulieu — pull together eight tracks and 42 minutes of varying sound, mood, rhythms and instrumentation to craft an album that encapsulates the 'anything goes' spirit of turntablism and funk, while running it through the bubbly scope of their provincial style of jazz.      According to the band, the LP's title,  Partager l'ambulance  (Sharing the Ambulance, for the Anglophones out there), refers to the ""choices we have to either address the crisis or ignore it and risk severe consequences in the future."" Although whether the ""crisis"" Misc is referring to is environmental or health-related (or both) isn't clear, the crawling, churning, end-of-days music that identifies tracks like ""Petite apathie"" and ""Mad"" confer that either are equally terrifying. As each piece plays off of the mostly-skin drum beats, proggy bass and wandering keys, the trio fill in a ton of space with grumbling synth, samples of people talking and tempered effects to create glacier sheets of sound that never interfere with the trio's late-night jams.      Opening track ""Le preacher"" unfolds brilliantly, starting off with the jazziest beat you'll hear all album, as a smoky piano plays a standard blues scale, before a strident vocal sample unleashes bouts of black key hammers and rapid-fire bass noodling. From there, the album rarely returns to its wrought ways as album standout ""Q-Line"" moves into dank, crawling Godspeed You! Black Emperor territory. Their gorgeous cover of Montreal brethren Sunns' 2018 track ""X-ALT"" (cleverly called ""X-ALT (Alt Version)""), captures the tension and angular nature of the original, with pianist Jérôme Beaulieu matching Sunns' vocalist Ben Shemie's reaching melodies. The closing track, ""Superman se pointera pas,"" brings the album full circle. The throbbing, atmospheric piece, courtesy of Simon Pagé's rumbling acoustic bass and William Côté's crackling drum sound, builds before transfiguring into a yearning, honest piano ballad that rises from the muddy racket.      On  Partager l'ambulance , Misc work hard in moving their craft — and the idea of sprightly Quebec jazz — forward, keeping their ears open to modern sounds and their minds open to even more resourceful ways of delivering them.

2021-02-01,Kaelen Bell,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC","On 'Ignorance,' the Weather Station Finds the Music to Match Her Expansive Poetry",,"Four songs into  the Weather Station 's shape-shifting  Ignorance , Tamara Lindeman finds herself outside a club and looking to the blue: ""I watched some bird fly up and land on the rooftop / Then up again into the sky / In and out of sight / Flying down again to land on the pavement."" There's beauty and possibility in that nervous zig-zag, so cellular and plain and awake. There's an ache, too, in seeing it lift just out of reach: ""You know it just kills me when I see some bird fly / It just kills me / And I don't know why.""    The Irish writer Robert Lynd said, ""In order to see birds it is necessary to become a part of the silence.""  Ignorance  is a record in search of that silence. Across ten tracks of jazz-influenced, liquid-silver art rock, Lindeman grasps at the world thrumming just beyond our punishing screens and endless news cycles, beyond our emotional and physical walls. As she sings on ""Parking Lot"" after the bird has left her sight, ""Everywhere we go there is an outside / Over all of these ceilings hangs a sky.""    It's easier said than done.  Ignorance  is a document of trying to become, the sound of the journey rather than the stillness of the destination. On ""Atlantic,"" Lindeman lies by the ocean, wine in hand, considering the sunset and the shearwaters reeling overhead. It's a dazzling moment, but she finds her head elsewhere: ""I should get all this dying off my mind / I should really know better than to read the headlines / Does it matter if I know? / Why can't I just cover my eyes?"" Even as waves crash and pink clouds mass on the cliffs, Lindeman can't escape the fear that it's all doomed.    The song's environmental anxiety is echoed in its skittering drums, oil-streak guitars, and flutes that dart and whirl like hummingbirds among blooming piano chords. Previous Weather Station records dealt in earthy, grounded textures, relying on Lindeman's words to create colour and depth. Inventive, lush, and propelled by taut rhythms and strings that gust like competing winds,  Ignorance  matches the subtle drama and sparkling intelligence of Lindeman's writing, exploding her music into opalescent shards.    The shattered-glass jazz of first single ""Robber"" opens the record like a warning shot, the kind of expansive capitalist critique that would collapse if tackled by a different sort of artist. In Lindeman's hands, these enormous ideas — environmental panic, capitalist exploitation, freedom, life, death, love — soften and settle into the human creases, free of clumsy dogma. She performs cutting examinations of society and self with the considered calm of a palm reader; her plea for wakefulness is at once individual and communal, molecular and seismic.    Over pulsing Wurlitzer and swinging strings, ""Tried to Tell You"" sees Lindeman begging a friend to open their heart to love, to spill their guts regardless of reciprocity or embarrassment, declaring that she ""will not help you not to feel / To tell yourself it was not real / And only fools believe."" On ""Heart,"" she asserts her own commitment to this righteous honesty: ""There are many things you may ask of me / But don't ask me for indifference / Don't come to me for distance."" Of course, in Lindeman's world, things are never so simple and people rarely so sure. As she drives away from a relationship for the last time on tidal closer ""Subdivisions,"" a pearl of doubt turns in her mind: ""But what if I misjudged? / In the wildest of emotion / I took this way too far.""    That crucial mutation of certainty and hesitation is best expressed in the simple, glowing chorus of ""Loss."" As keys squeal like exposed wires and voices encircle her, Lindeman repeats a mantra: ""Loss is loss / Is loss / Is loss."" In her hopeful, reaching delivery, another meaning begins to form: the wonderment of love is that it endures regardless of whether you fuck it up or leave it behind, whether it's shared or understood. Loss is loss, but it's discovery too.    In a newsletter to fans released last year, Lindeman wrote about her late introduction to the work of legendary filmmaker Agnès Varda. In Varda, Lindeman describes an artist who creates free of machismo and demolishing ego: ""Through the lens of her camera, everything is expanded, changed, renewed. Her filmic gaze is almost always one of restoration and generosity. How rare is this!"" Varda herself once said that her aim was never to show, but to ""give people the desire the see."" Lindeman's songs move much like Varda's lens — rather than a guidebook, they provide a kaleidoscope.  Ignorance  suggests a new way to see the world, asking only that you release yourself to wildness and feeling, to the unanswerable questions and the world beyond yourself. It's all there — in the shifting clouds and the upward spiral of birds, in the opening flowers and the weeds that overtake them — just waiting to be found.

2021-01-12,Daryl Keating,8,"POP AND ROCK,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Sleaford Mods Show Their Versatility on 'Spare Ribs',,"Six albums in, the idiosyncratic style of Nottingham duo  Sleaford Mods  is still very much intact on  Spare Ribs . Andrew Fearn's minimalistic, catchy-as-hell beats are still propping up the antics, while Jason Williamson continues to deliver his run-down, guttural ramblings like the drunken, working-class hero we all presume him to be.     Sleaford Mods have always shoved a kebab-soaked middle finger in the face of anyone (anyone at all) deemed to be a ""wanker."" This record, however, sees them take chunks out of an identifiable foe — specifically, the British government — more specifically, shamed political advisor Dominic Cummings. In swirling intro ""A New Brick,"" Williamson protests, ""We're all so Tory tired, and beaten by minds small,"" announcing his distaste for Britain's Conservative Party. He then proceeds to rip into Cummings, who got reprimanded earlier this year for breaking lockdown rules during the pandemic, with the sardonic, bass-driven ""Shortcummings."" In true Mods style, it's both hilarious and melodious.     It also leans on another classic tack by the duo, which is to layer Williamson's voice over other recordings of Williamson's voice. The end result makes for something that's not unlike the rabble of a busy pub on darts night. In fact, the whole thing sounds like it was written, recorded and sponsored by some piss-stained back-alley bar; there's an undeniable layer of grime fusing their whole back catalogue together, and  Spare Ribs  slides happily into its well-earned spot on the dirt heap.     Sleaford Mods are at the point in their career where some weighty faces would surely jump at the chance to collaborate with them. Hell, Liam Gallagher would probably raise his hand just for the street cred, but Sleaford Mods have done exactly the right thing by choosing to work with some relatively unknowns on the album.    First up is Amy Taylor of Australian band  Amyl and the Sniffers , whose decidedly brief contribution to ""Nudge It"" fits surprisingly well with the Mods' sound. A collab that's a bit closer to home for the duo is the contribution from Bournemouth resident Billy Nomates on ""Mork N Mindy."" She seems more like a female version of Mods than anyone out there at the moment, but she has a proper singing voice, and as such, shines as one of the only parts of the record that could be deemed pleasant.    The first half of  Spare Ribs  is actually quite slowed down and weird, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't complement Williamson's vocals as well. There's something about his East Midlands twang that works far better with a faster tempo. Williamson is just too haggard-sounding to plod along. We need him chugging, and chug he does. The last few tracks, save for outro ""Fishcakes,"" are all quick-fire bangers. The title track and ""Thick Ear"" absolutely steal the show. Sleaford Mods have shown they can do it slow, but they're still much better when they floor it.

2021-01-13,Jordan Currie,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Pearl Charles Brings Sulky Country to the Disco on 'Magic Mirror',,"Pearl Charles  may have released  Magic Mirror  in January, but it's far from being a wintery album with a drab tone. The singer-songwriter's second LP is a blissful journey of cosmic country, disco and poppy psych rock that dances its way into the new year.  Magic Mirror i s a young woman's trip through a whirlwind of self-reflection and self-discovery.    Charles has doubled down on her unique sound of '60s- and '70s-inspired country-disco since the release of her debut album,  Sleepless Dreamer , and since her time performing in country duo the Driftwood Singers. ""Only for Tonight"" kickstarts the album with a glittery bang — a song that channels ABBA's discography, made to light up a dance floor. ""What I Need"" immediately calms listeners down from the heat of the opener with its cool and breezy twangs about prioritizing yourself in a relationship, even if it hurts.    As much jubilant fun as Charles has on this album, she equally expresses moments of self-doubt, loneliness and introspection. On ""Don't Feel Like Myself,"" she sings of being too scared to die, yet barely feeling alive; the charming country lilt in her vocals uplifts the sound and keeps it from sounding outright sad. On the album's title track, she croons, ""My eyes are red, my heart is blue"" atop warm piano and organ chords. By marrying the sunny instrumentals and the darker, soul-searching lyrics, Charles highlights that these contrasting emotions often coexist with one another in life. It's wholly possible to crank the music up in the car, roll down the windows, and tap your foot along to the beat while feeling a little bit empty inside at the same time.    ""As Long As You're Mine"" closes the album, accented by silky horns that sound straight out of an Otis Redding song, where Charles professes that she will always be there for someone she loves, showing that even if love gets complicated, it can always be found and restored again. On  Magic Mirror,  Charles may be self-doubting and even gloomy at times, but she never loses her glowing spirit and hope for the many more adventures her life will lead her on.

2021-01-13,Kerry Doole,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",NDP MP Charlie Angus' Songwriting Remains Potent on Grievous Angels' 'Summer Before the Storm',,"Ontario folk veterans  Grievous Angels  are back with new material after a seven-year-long hiatus, attributed to the fact that the band's principal songwriter, Charlie Angus, has a day job as the NDP MP for the Timmins—James Bay riding.  Summer Before the Storm  confirms that Angus' songwriting remains potent.    The material poetically covers both the personal and the political. On the tale of a love lost, ""A House Where Love Died,"" Angus and co-vocalist Janet Mercier trade lines, adding poignancy to the lyrics: ""We had a mansion we never realized, now it's the house where our love died."" Angus is no vocal stylist, but his voice has a ruggedly honest feel; it is complimented here by Mercier's sweeter vocals, with the pair often swapping verses and harmonizing.     Skydiggers  vocalist Andy Maize adds range on a handful of songs. His contributions are especially effective on ""Fields of Normandy"" — a poignant tribute to Canadian vets — as well as the jaunty ""Red Deer to Margaree."" Given the demands of Angus' MP job, it is no surprise that themes of travel recur here, as on ""Mile Outside of Kirkland."" The most lyrically compelling number is ""All Night Depanneur,"" a portrait of a veteran with PTSD who, while buying beer in Hull, has a flashback to a former hell: ""When I see the snow, I see Sarajevo and that village burning by the road.""     The masterful collection closes with the title song. Atmospheric strings add to the apocalyptic feel of the lyrics, but there is a beacon of light in the distance – ""a baby being born, for tomorrow comes from today."" This serves as a bookend to the opening tune, ""The Morning After,"" a spirited folk-rock romp with an optimistic tone.    Eight of the 10 songs song are sole Angus compositions. ""Running Back to You"" is a co-write with one-time L'Étranger bandmate and former NDP MP  Andrew Cash , while ""Iron Working Man"" was written but never recorded by late Newfoundland folk legend  Ron Hynes  — he'd surely be thrilled at this rousing version that has a singalong quality perfect for a picket line.    Musically, the group is certainly not reinventing the wheel, but there is something refreshing about their old-school folk approach. When was the last time you heard harmonica solos? They come courtesy of original member Peter Jellard, whose potent contributions on accordion and fiddle have long been a core component of the Grievous Angels' sound. Guest players on trumpet and keyboards add a crisp texture, while the joint production of Angus, Tim Hadley and Nicolas Tjelios is sharp and uncluttered.     Back in the early '90s, Grievous Angels earned two Juno Award nominations.  Summer Before the Storm  merits similar consideration.

2021-01-18,Alex Hudson,8,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Kiwi Jr.'s 'Cooler Returns' Is Packed with Golden Hooks and Subtle Weirdness,,"At a glance,  Kiwi Jr. 's music scans as a retro revival of '60s pop sweetness and '90s slacker rock swagger — especially since frontman Jeremy Gaudet's drawling sing-speak sounds unmistakably like Stephen Malkmus. But pull their songs apart and you'll discover a surrealist sense of adventure. Golden hooks appear once and are never repeated, arrangements avoid predictable verse-chorus structures, and lyric sheets are packed with hyper-specific references and quirky non sequiturs.     Cooler Returns , the Toronto band's second album and first for indie institution Sub Pop, continues the momentum of 2019's  Football Money  with another fast-and-furious collection of rock songs that take familiar sounds — jangling indie pop, spiky post-punk riffs, wheezing harmonica — and twist them into subtly wonky shapes.    These 13 songs take a few listens to sift through and fully appreciate — like the way the chorus of ""Only Here for a Haircut"" alternates between bluesy minor intervals and sunny major-key lifts, or the way ""Maid Marian's Toast"" opens with a comical olde-tyme parable: ""Ye own the beehive, thus ye own all of the honey.""    Yes, there are instantly gratifying hooks: in particular,  ""Undecided Voters,""  ""Domino"" and ""Waiting in Line"" are stomping power pop anthems with shout-along choruses and ample repetitions of the title phrases. Album opener ""Tyler"" begins the record with a verse about clinging onto a low-rent apartment — something that will immediately resonate with anyone who has ever lived in a big, expensive city.    The real fun of  Cooler Returns , though, lies in the clever details that you might never understand, no matter how many times you listen. ""Omaha"" careens between giddy chorus melodies and complex time signatures that make the song feel like its tripping over itself, while the lyrics are a free association grab bag of bizarre phrases. ""Tigers in the coliseum / Lions at the Comfort Inn / Ra-ra Omaha / Home of the husbands"" goes one passage in the first verse. What does it mean? Who the hell knows, but it sounds amazing.

The project's sensuous, mellifluous driving force, now long-known to be Canadian musician Michael Milosh, eschewed traditional markers of gender and identity — no matter your preferences, if there's anything you find sexy, there's a good chance you could be entranced by Rhye's seductive R&B.    But even the best sex loses its spark if there's nothing to spice it up. Despite a lineup shift between Rhye's 2013 breakthrough debut,  Woman , and 2018 follow-up,  Blood , the albums covered similar ground, while 2019's  Spirit   — a collection of piano ballads — brought a different compositional approach to similar conclusions. While the records succeeded on the prettiness of Milosh's voice and arrangements, they didn't push the project's peak any further than  Woman 's undeniable one-two opening punch of ""Open"" and ""The Fall,"" Rhye's calling cards since the project's inception.     Home  starts to move things into a bolder, brighter new direction thanks to a new pair of hits. ""Come in Closer"" and ""Safeword"" elevate Milosh's tried-and-true formula, the former featuring a four-on-the-floor beat that drives the synth- and string-driven palette, the latter accented by soft Spanish guitars and flute-like synths before cascading into a soft, vulnerable outro as Milosh pleads the listener to ""be careful with me.""    The album's strongest moments are filled with the kind of expansive, hi-fi orchestral pop production that is just begging to be sampled by Jens Lekman, anchoring Milosh's weightless voice with hooky instrumentals, like the chintzy horns on ""Hold You Down"" and the disco strings on ""Black Rain."" Other moments are less captivating, either falling into the same lovelorn haze of previous releases, like ""Helpless"" and ""Sweetest Revenge,"" or succumbing to the ether entirely, like the finger-picked plod of ""Need a Love"" and repetitive groove of ""Holy.""    While  Home  lacks the consistency of previous records, it makes a strong case for Rhye as a pop star waiting in the wings, à la the Weeknd, thanks to a voice versatile enough to complement any instrumental choice. Four albums in, Rhye has finally begun to branch out, and not a moment too soon.

2021-01-19,Luke Pearson,7,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Bicep's Trance Formula Works Most of the Time on 'Isles',,"Irish duo  Bicep  debuted strongly in 2017 with  their self-titled album  — a confident mix of continental trance melodicism and urban grit that earned them many an accolade. Inspired by their relocation to London and its cultural diversity, their second outing,  Isles , offers a slicker, more ambitious version of their debut — more layers, more vocals, more focus, and crisper, harder-hitting production. There are perhaps signs that, as deft and well-judged as it is, the duo's style might only take them so far, but by and large this is a very good sophomore effort that makes good on their early promise.     Isles  starts invitingly with the classic '90s ambient pads of ""Atlas,"" setting the stage with a nimble lead melody that slots in tightly to the first of many expertly-crafted breakbeats. Almost every track following has something to offer as well — lead single ""Apricots,"" with its mysterious vocal sample and affecting synths; ""Saku,"" giving solid Disclosure vibes thanks to guest vocalist Clara La San; the imposing synth line of ""X,"" which sounds like an unused sequence from Daft Punk's  Tron  soundtrack; and ""Hawk,"" which closes the album with perhaps its most unusual melody, made distinct by some subtly dissonant lead flourishes that catch the ear for a memorable send-off.    While details like these definitely elevate  Isles , the duo's formula does wear thin periodically. Like a lot of trance, most of the album's tracks start and end with the same four-note melody, with the beat fated to drop out at some point to make way for an equally destined fading-in of another element lately absent before the beat returns. The best trance, progressive or otherwise, makes the most of these standard transitions with dynamic builds and breakdowns — a luxury afforded by its quicker tempo and driving momentum. In comparison, Bicep can sound a bit slow and plodding at times, shuffling the same building blocks around without the urgency and epic stakes to make the shell game interesting in and of itself.    The formula certainly has its merits though, and Bicep bring them to the fore better than most on  Isles , and all with an appealingly late-night, cosmopolitan flair, where ghostly fragments of Hindi, Turkish pop or Bulgarian choirs are just as likely to hover among the neon synths as the usual breathy trance sirens. It gives the album a bustling, urban energy that very much works in its favour, even if its style might slightly outweigh its substance sometimes.  ( Ninja Tune )                           DANCE AND ELECTRONIC   REVIEWS   MUSIC   ALBUM              More Bicep",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/bicep_isles_album_review

The debut record from the Toronto sludge metal outfit is an existential record that requires multiple listens to unearth all of its qualities.    Things get off to a doomy start with ""Ignorance Is Bliss,"" with punishing low-end that recalls bands like Demonic Possessor and sets the ambiance for the rest of the album. All of Kawthra's music is based off of contrast, and the melodic lead guitar moments balance perfectly off of the morose rhythmic passages. The song's peak is a Black Sheep Wall-style breakdown that keeps growing until its cathartic finale.     The Tenets ' highlight is its centrepiece, ""Confidence Is Key,"" based off of a massive riff that slowly builds and mutates as the song progresses. Drummer Davis Maxwell has some of his best work on this song as his fills play off the riffs. The album's closer, ""Belief Is Reality,"" is full of sonic contrast between full-on melodic guitar passages and extreme dissonance. With lyrics discussing moments of utter contempt that people have towards one another, the musical instrumentation really helps to create an uneasy experience.    Interludes ""No One Listens"" and ""No One Changes"" offer a great shift in dynamics with their minimalist instrumental arrangements. The mix of sparse electronics with clean guitar tones creates a calming sensation. These two interludes operate as great palate cleansers between the longer, more intense tracks.     The Tenets  is a record of punishing sludge metal that offers an introspective backdrop. Although the key messages from the album appear to be dire and bleak, there is an invigorating quality to the music that begs for multiple visits. For an all-encompassing album that does not take any shortcuts, Kawthra's  The Tenets  is the complete experience.

I am in a contained room, but I am also in my mind within a room, and my mind is boundless. Is my room then also boundless? This, the finiteness of space and how it gets complicated by our minds, is something explored by Vancouver-based band  Bill Jr. Jr.  on  Homebod y.    Through nostalgia-soaked melodies and yearning lyrics,  Homebody  is, unlike its title, anything but circumscribed. It is a beautifully expansive record that wavers on the edge of chaos, wondering whether it's having a good time there.  Homebody  is a stunningly produced study in the paradoxical emotions we have about the spaces we occupy, ones we wish we occupied and ones we wish we could leave.    According to lyricist, vocalist and guitarist Russell Gendron,  Homebody 's name comes from a period of physical transition, borne from a series of moves across Canada and the United States, yet with a sustained and inevitable stuck-ness remaining within the self —a feeling that is successfully conveyed through each track's sound.    ""City Limit"" tackles space in a delightfully feverish way, just this side of unhinged. The lyrics are worried about a loss of time, and by proxy, a loss of space. ""When I walk these streets of mine [...] I don't know what's mine,"" Gendron croons, going on to say that along with losing time, he's losing his mind. Just as this revelation comes, the melody becomes delirious and urgent, Gendron's voice echoing like that of a spirit wandering aimlessly through a ghost town, until it finally becomes swallowed by the wail of a violin. You can have all the space and time you want, but eventually it won't be enough for a rapacious mind.     A feeling of sorrow undergirds this idea of not having enough space, like on ""Dear Neighbour."" With its blooming guitars and driving drums, it's almost as if the music is confirming the findings of the lyrics — that there won't be enough space, nor enough time. ""Half Hitch"" speaks of getting lost in songs themselves, as though they are an enchanting labyrinth, meanwhile physical spaces are too vast so you mustn't ""stray too far."" On ""Blue,"" Gendron sings of crawling and creeping through his neighbourhood, as the guitar plucks a beachy melody, making the most of the space he's in, even as a blueness occasionally overwhelms him.    All the tracks on this album flow in a way that makes intuitive sense. The album's cover is a jumble of places that Gendron moved through, including Georgia, Vancouver and Montreal. Much like the sound of the album itself, the cover is a pastel unreality, created out of a finiteness, as if gently declaring that any space full of the resounding and measured sound of  Homebody  can't be a terrible space.

2021-01-25,Kyle Kohner,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Arlo Parks' 'Collapsed in Sunbeams' Shows Her Potential to Become the Voice of a Generation,,"On her long-awaited debut album,  Collapsed in Sunbeams , British phenom  Arlo Parks  has delivered an essential reprieve from what has been a devastatingly drab past few months without diving too deep into discussions about the pandemic and social unrest.    This is not to say  Collapsed in Sunbeams  is here to heal wounds. No, the weight of the world should never fall on a single person. But Parks is different — an extraordinary artist who's shown, through a small body of work, the talent to convey complex emotion with a sense of maturity beyond her 20 years of age, managing to express it all as if she's lived a lifetime or two.    On the overcast trip-hop gem ""Black Dog,"" Parks writes to a dear friend who's struggling through their own bout of depression, personifying it as a black dog, pleading, ""I'd take a jump off the fire escape / To make the black dog go away / Alice, I know that you are trying / And that's what makes it terrifying."" The compassionate nature of Parks' words here is not a rare occurrence — empathy is draped all over this record. ""For Violet"" sees Parks' dedication to others on full display, as she comforts the titular Violet, promising them, ""You know that I'll be there to kiss the damage."" On ""Eugene,"" an ode to a friend, she relinquishes envy to save their bond.    Parks has a lifetime of experiences in front of her still. But she's able to communicate such profound feelings because she's not far removed from her years as a teen; she can tap into the turbulence of adolescent emotions.    Parks can raise hairs with a simple turn of phrase and poetic image — if only the music encompassing her words was as compelling. Tracks like ""Black Dog,"" ""For Violet,"" and ""Portra 400"" are all cut from the same gloomily textured trip-hop cloth, and they're easily the album's most stunning moments. Her formula combines melting guitars with downtempo beats and grainy sonic textures, but this blueprint works, primarily, because it allows Parks' hymnal intonations to slice through the rain like aural rays of sunlight. These tracks point toward a more compelling musical direction that would allow Parks to stand out as a singular pop artist, but the overwhelmingly simple bedroom pop stylings that decorate the majority of the album struggle to leave a mark.    ""Bluish,"" for example, features a intimate vocal performance and a delectably rainy atmosphere that's easy to be lured into. However, the song's uncomplicated lo-fi beats and simplistic bassline stagnate and stall, never taking the listener anywhere beyond what it offers on the surface. Then there is ""Hope,"" the album's lyrical linchpin about being there for another during a time of depression and desperation; Parks breathes life-giving energy into ""Hope,"" both with her soulful voice and encouraging words, but that same feeling doesn't come across in the lifeless piano and shuffling drums.    Nevertheless, Parks' wise words are indeed the album's saving grace. With her precocious writing capabilities, it's possible to envision the potential of someone who really could become the voice of this new generation. If anything, she's a special storyteller who will only garner more respect and attention as time passes.

2021-01-26,Sydney Brasil,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Rosier Find Cohesion in Their Diverse Influences on 'Légèrement',,"After releasing an EP in the fall of 2019,  Rosier  are back with their first full-length effort since changing their name. Formerly Les Poules à Colin, the band  say  that they wish to stay true to themselves as ""romantic beings who complete one another through their differences.""  Légèrement  embodies this by drawing together many diverse sounds into one cohesive vision.     Légèrement  proudly displays Rosier's rich, varied influences by seamlessly weaving elements of jazz, pop and indie into a long-standing folk tradition. The quintet come from a well-established arts community, evident from the strong sense of musical identity that permeates the album. It's clear that Rosier are practiced, seasoned musicians.    While retaining its cultural richness, the album delivers a fresh sound that comes from Rosier's ability to pull together different styles, old and new, while maintaining the strength of their creative vision. Rosier are talented songwriters and arrangers, and  Légèrement  is exemplary of their combined musicality. The harmonies are dainty and ethereal without ever being lost on the listener. The production is also a strength; despite the lush and often complex arrangements, every element is clear and cohesive. The instrumentation is diverse, but every part falls right into place.    The elegant use of vintage synthesizers lends a dream pop sensibility to the album, while stringed instruments like acoustic guitars and banjos keep the arrangements grounded and organic. These juxtapositions work to create an atmosphere of nostalgic introspection, particularly when the synth break in ""Dans Les Voyages"" cradles you in its melancholia. The keys have this effect on most of the record, but single ""Pontoise"" is a notable exception. Stylistically different from the rest of the album, it's reminiscent of chamber pop, sounding like it could be on a Weyes Blood record. The guitars are melodic, and the omnichord accents them tastefully.     Légèrement  is pensive and mellow, but swayed by a wave of optimism that carries it to many of its high points. Comforting and nostalgic, it retains a cloudless vision of what Rosier set out to do, and how well they're able to do it.

2021-01-26,Mark Tremblay,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Portrayal of Guilt Elevate Their Noisy Craft on 'We Are Always Alone',,"Portrayal of Guilt  are slowly becoming an institution in the realm of heavy music. Existing as sonic drifters amongst many subgenres, Portrayal of Guilt have created their own signature sound amongst a backdrop of noise, hardcore and black metal. Their new record,  We Are Always Alone , has meticulously distilled the best aspects of their sound into its most refined form.    For an album that pulls from extreme forms of music, there is an incredibly powerful sense of melody and pop structure to these songs. The experience makes for an extremely catchy album the entire way through. From the hypnotic melodies on ""Anesthetized"" and ""It's Already Over"" to the pop-punk ""Masochistic Oath,"" there are plenty of memorable moments on here for a band that is not known for their melodic prowess.     Previous Portrayal of Guilt releases often ran into this issue of implementing their harsh noise or atmospheric elements as a means of stringing songs together.  We Are Always Alone  has really tamed down these elements this time around, but they are most certainly not forgotten about. Subtle transitions between songs help to set the overall mood of the album without drowning out its substance, acting as a great palate cleanser before the listener is submerged into the album's next sonic barrage.    Vocalist Matt King has really expanded his range on this album. Not only are his signature screams and howls more vile than ever, but he is also able to deliver them with ever-increasing clarity, alongside a vast amount of vocal experimentation. From the catchy vocal chorus on ""It's Already Over"" to the melodic outro on ""My Immolation,"" the vocals provide some of the best moments on the record.     We Are Always Alone  is a further ascension of Portrayal of Guilt as one of the best artists in heavy music. It is too early to call this the band's best work, as there is so much more to come from this band going forward. For a heavy album full of unexpected surprises,  We Are Always Alone  is an ideal second full-length from an up-and-coming band.     ( Closed Casket Activities )                           METAL AND HARDCORE   REVIEWS   MUSIC   ALBUM              More Portrayal of Guilt",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/portrayal_of_guilt_we_are_always_alone_album_review
2020-12-14,Angela Morrison,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Taylor Swift Finds the Sunshine on 'evermore',,"Just five months after  Taylor Swift  surprised the world with the sudden release of her eighth studio album,  folklore , she decided to celebrate her 31st birthday by releasing  folklore 's self-proclaimed ""sister"" album,  evermore . As she  noted on Instagram , 31 is a mirror image of her lucky number 13, neatly underscoring the way the two records intertwine, converge and subtly diverge in their themes, textures and subject matter.    In  our  folklore  review , we said that the album ""feels like the culmination of a decade's worth of public growth and artistic fine-tuning"" — this rings true for  evermore  as well, with songs like ""happiness"" and ""ivy"" demonstrating some of Swift's most mature songwriting to date. From the starry-eyed country-pop of earlier releases and the sparkling, polished synth-pop of recent work to  folklore 's minimalistic piano- and guitar-driven folk sound, what has remained constant throughout all of these different eras is her perfectly calibrated lyrical romanticism, on full display across  evermore 's tracks.    Sonically,  evermore  is largely a continuation of the soft, hushed folk-pop of  folklore , a result of Swift's ongoing collaborations with producers such as  the National 's  Aaron Dessner  and pop mastermind  Jack Antonoff . Where  folklore  is more solemn, evoking rain-chilled late-summertime sadness,  evermore  makes more room for warmth and playfulness, particularly on tracks such as the  HAIM -assisted, ""Before He Cheats""-style murder mystery ""no body, no crime"" and the gently country-tinged tale of swindlers in love, ""cowboy like me.""    If Swift is lost in the woods throughout  folklore ,  evermore  finds a little bit of sunlight streaming through the trees (evoking her words of wisdom from 2014's ""Out of the Woods"": ""The monsters turned out to be just trees""). Even on ""marjorie,"" a wistful ode to her late grandmother, Swift paints a bittersweet portrait of tender memories: ""The autumn chill that wakes me up / You loved the amber skies so much / Long limbs and frozen swims / You'd always go past where our feet could touch."" In a typical Swiftian flourish, ""marjorie"" sits at track 13, creating a mirror image to  folklore 's ""epiphany,"" dedicated to her grandfather's experience in the military and the long-lasting effects of PTSD.    Much like  folklore 's narratives, including an ill-fated teenage love triangle and the gossipy, seaside story of real-life composer Rebekah Harkness in ""the last great american dynasty,"" Swift finds a delicate balance between fanciful escapism and self-mythologizing on  evermore  in tracks such as ""champagne problems,"" ""'tis the damn season,"" and ""dorothea."" These musical short stories are mostly delightful, but the magic of Swift's songwriting lies in her ability to sketch beautiful, emotionally-charged lines that cut through what might be considered disingenuous or manipulative posturing. When she lets go and turns toward messier, irresolvable situations, some of her best writing emerges, as in the chorus of ""ivy"" when she sings, ""My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand,"" or on the devastating ""tolerate it"": ""Lay the table with the fancy shit / And watch you tolerate it.""    While retreading  folklore 's ground,  evermore  deepens and enriches its older sister's world. Each of Swift's albums provides an embarrassment of riches for fans to parse through — at least until her next release, which will more than likely arrive sooner than anyone thinks.

2020-12-14,Kaelen Bell,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Avalanches Give Their Signature Sound a Collaborative Update on 'We Will Always Love You',,"Albums by  the Avalanches  used to introduce themselves like dreamy street festivals — crowd chatter, hot pavement, snippets of music — arriving on the sounds of togetherness and life.  We Will Always Love You , the duo's celestial third album, arrives alone as Orono Naguchi's sombre voice comes through the gentle blue fuzz of an answering machine and sets the scene.  We Will Always Love  You is about that terrifying, galactic solitude, about the enormity of space and the enormity of love, about stars and light and being all alone together.    Inspired, in part, by Ann Druyan and Carl Sagan's cosmic love story, the record is narrated by an impressive cavalry of interstellar guides.  Blood Orange ,  Vashti Bunyan ,  Karen O ,  Kurt Vile ,  Neneh Cherry  and a dozen others provide their voices; characters in a grand odyssey that's less interested in traditional storytelling than in illuminating big, indescribable feelings. Samples still abound, but they accentuate the songs rather than define them, making room for live instrumentation and new voices.    The sheer breadth of talent that Robert Chater and Tony Di Blasi have assembled is dizzying, their collaborators as imaginatively selected as their samples. The Blood Orange-featuring title track's sample of  the Roches ' ""Hammond Song"" is particularly inspired, doing loving justice to an untouchable, near-mythic track. The 25-track, 71-minute record does start to meander slightly, getting lost among the stars somewhere after the joyous Cola Boyy and Mick Jones-featuring ""We Go On,"" but it all comes softly back into focus on the gorgeous ""Gold Sky,"" as Kurt Vile guides the song through a galaxy of coos, handclaps and shimmering synths like some wise wizard in the sky.     It's a different kind of majesty from a band haunted by their monumental, defining debut, 2001's  Since I Left You .  By opening their sound to new collaborators and the wide expanse of the sky, the Avalanches have found a way to move forward, alone but together.

2020-12-14,Riley Wallace,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Kid Cudi's 'Man on the Moon III: The Chosen' Is a Triumphant Finale,,"In October 2016,  Kid Cudi  had hit rock bottom. He checked himself into rehab and  shared a heartbreaking letter  on Facebook in which he described himself as a ""damaged human swimming in a pool of emotions."" Four years later, the man who was once ""on the pursuit of happiness"" before going to hell and back on the road to mental clarity has seemingly found the peace he needed — making  Man on the Moon III: The Chosen 's hour-long journey that much more fruitful and impactful.    While he's released numerous projects over the years, Kid Cudi's  Man on the Moon  series stands as his most revered work. The first two instalments were released a year apart ( The  End of Day  in 2009 and  The Legend of Mr. Rager  in 2010), but a little over a decade has lapsed leading up to this third and final instalment. It couldn't have come at a better time.    Sitting at 18 songs and produced by a cast that includes long-time collaborators like Dot da Genius, Plain Pat and  Mike Dean , Cudi crafts a body of work that plays poignantly, even you're not fully immersed in his back catalog.     Much like its predecessors,  Man on the Moon  III  is separated into acts, with a narrative that finds Cudi falling into old habits and facing his demons, but also persevering and reflecting. Cudi sparkles in the first two acts, from going full Mr. Rager on the Dot da Genius-helmed ""She Knows This"" to his menacing flow on ""Heaven on Earth"" — over a beat that sounds like a trap-tinged music box. He also holds his own on project outlier ""Show Out,"" featuring the late  Pop Smoke  and UK MC  Skepta .    While satisfying, the most endearing and powerful standout moments appear in the third and fourth acts. ""The Void"" sees Cudi lamenting on his struggles with mental health and the lengths he goes to avoid falling into the dark hole of depression that remains at his heels. The song's outro is rather touching, as he croons a heartfelt ""thank you"" to everyone who's stayed in his corner throughout his tribulations.    The final two-song sequence of ""4 da Kidz"" and ""Lord Knows"" has Cudder reassuring the youth who connect with his story that they aren't alone while revelling in his blessings, seemingly content with his current state.     Kid Cudi has made his real-life struggles with depression and drugs a running focus of his catalog, and in the process, helped a legion of die-hard fans get through some of the most challenging moments of their lives.  Man on the Moon III  proves that even the most harrowing stories can end on a bright note.

2020-12-15,Katie Tymochenko,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Paul McCartney Recaptures the Magic of His Earliest Solo Work on 'McCartney III',,"Like its predecessors  McCartney  (1970) and  McCartney II  (1980),  McCartney III  was written, recorded and produced entirely by Sir  Paul McCartney  — this time, created alone during a COVID-19 lockdown. It is with  McCartney III  that one of the world's most celebrated songwriters has completed his trifecta of ultimate solo albums, proving yet again his legacy as a musical virtuoso.    From the very beginning, it's clear that this album is going to highlight McCartney's abilities as a composer. He's not concerning himself with writing any more hits; instead, he has chosen to display his talent and love for the instruments that have carried his career for over 60 years. Opener ""Long Tailed Winter Bird"" shows off his instrumental capabilities at their finest. With limited lyrics, the acoustic number highlights his talents as a guitar player. He uses unconventional harmonies but still finds a way to deliver an impressive instrumental track that's both rhythmic and dynamic.    McCartney conquers the blues on riff-laden ""Slidin'"" and ""Lavatory Lil,"" of which the former showcases his multi-layered approach to songwriting as he performs a deeply complicated track that proves that rock'n'roll definitely isn't dead.    While instrumentation is the driving force behind the album, lyrically, McCartney doesn't fall short when addressing important issues faced in society today. On ""Seize the Day,"" he warns about the climate crisis, while on ""Find My Way,"" he addresses issues surrounding self-identity and anxiety. His vocals are consistently strong as he radiates enthusiasm throughout the entire record.    With much of modern day music originating from the experimental approach  the Beatles  took in the late '60s, it's a joy to see McCartney still exploring those sides in his current songwriting. It's safe to say McCartney hasn't abandoned his sense of exploration, as on eight-minute psych track ""Deep Deep Feeling,"" which takes a sonic trip through his psyche.    The  McCartney  trilogy has charted a course through the Beatles' breakup to through the impending rise of new wave and synth pop and, now, to this year's extended isolation and the power of home recording. His music already transcended time, but with the completion of this trilogy he has drawn a link through the past 50 years with his virtuosic compositions.

2020-12-18,Alex Hudson,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,SOUNDTRACKS,MUSIC","Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and Jon Batiste's 'Soul' Soundtrack Feels Like Two Scores in One",,"The soundtrack to Pixar's new animated masterpiece  Soul   is, essentially, two scores in one.    On the one hand, you've got music by New Orleans artist  Jon Batiste  (known as the bandleader on  The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ). His contributions are mostly peppy jazz, ranging from the solo piano reverie of ""Born to Play Reprise"" to the horn-fuelled strut of ""Feel Soul Good."" Appearing as diegetic sound in  Soul  — most often performed by the film's lead character, a middle school band teacher named Joe — this lively jazz represents the earthly world in the film's exploration of a soul's journey.    Representing the spiritual realm, the other half of the soundtrack goes to  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross . The mood-setting  Nine Inch Nails  duo brilliantly capture the film's psychedelic depiction of the afterlife (and the before-life) with twinkling electronic soundscapes that range from ominously sublime ambience (""The Great Beyond"") to bubbly and serene (""Portal/The Hall of Everything"").    With gently thudding beats and major key pads, Reznor and Ross give their contributions a soothing new age feel that recalls their work on  Mid90s  or  Gone Girl ,  rather than their more ominous and industrial sound design on  Watchmen  or  Bird Box . Things do get a little harsh and eerie on ""Lost Soul,"" but their work here is mostly sweet and pretty enough to be appropriate for a family film.    The score also features a goofy hip-hop interlude from  Daveed Diggs  (""Rappin Ced"") and a folk-soul ballad by Cody Chesnutt (""Parting Ways""). These aren't bad, exactly, but they add a sense of scattered incoherence to an album that, with 42 songs and a runtime of barely more than hour, already moves at a frantic pace.     Soul  might have flowed better had it been divvied up into two distinct haves — one side for Batiste and another for Reznor and Ross — rather than bouncing back and forth between the two styles; many streaming listeners are probably already creating their own playlists for which half they like best.    The best moments of all come when Reznor and Ross successfully blur the lines between the score's two distinct styles: ""Earthbound"" and the gorgeous ""Epiphany"" are hypnotic piano meditations, and ""Pursuit"" begins as jittery jazz before melting into spooky electronic pulses.    While  Soul 's ultra-short track lengths make it feel a little underdeveloped as a stand-alone soundtrack, it makes a strong calling card for the beautifully scored film.

2020-12-21,Luke Fox,7,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Eminem Can't Shake the Haters on 'Music to Be Murdered By - Side B',,"A wise man once said, don't read your mentions. He said to ignore the comments section. He warned artists that it's dangerous to read your own reviews. He said if you get a confidence boost from the positive critiques, you'll also writhe from the pangs of the negative.     Try as he might, the quintuple-diamond-certified emcee  Eminem  still can't help from caring what you think of him. His stamp-of-approval collection will never be complete.     Oh, the irony: Mr. Just Don't Give A Fuck is prone to creative handcuffing because he cares too much. Fellow Dr. Dre protégé-turned-icon  Snoop Dogg's refusal to place Eminem in his top-10 all-time  stings something extra. And positioning 50-plus minutes of fresh music as a  ""deluxe version""  of  his last album  feels like a strategy to lower expectations.     During the flashes when the artist born Marshall Mathers feels free of this critical gaze, however, this surprise Christmas gift to diehard stans,  Music to Be Murdered By - Side B , soars something brilliant. Stuffed in a state-of-the-art personal studio, quarantined in a mansion with an elevator, the trailer park boy with the otherworldly talent and unquenchable work ethic is still wrestling with an unsolvable Rubik's cube.    ""I want you to change, but don't change / I want you to grow up, but don't age / I want the rage, but don't get too angry / I want the new but old Shady / I want you to say what they won't say / Just don't go too far but go cray,"" Eminem mocks on ""These Demons,"" spitting from his haters' point of view. ""They keep movin' the goalpost, don't they?"" At 48, Eminem is better off when he's not trying to appease listeners' opinions or obsessing over his own legacy. Isn't that the point of being rich and successful? So you can set the goalposts?    Thankfully,  Side B  does have those moments, when Mathers indulges that kid who dreamed of dookie gold ropes and rushed home after school to soak in every second of  Yo! MTV Raps . Once the listener burns through forgettable opener ""Black Magic"" — a less-inspired tread through a familiar Eminem theme, the increasingly toxic relationship drama, complete with Skylar Grey hook — the fun begins.     Over the three-song run of ""Alfred's Theme"" (which jacks Charles Gounod's ""Funeral March of a Marionette,"" best known as the theme music to  Alfred Hitchcock Presents , to delirious effect), ""Tone Deaf,"" and ""Book of Rhymes"" (which climaxes with a flurry of DJ Premier scratches), Slim Shady stuffs more rewind-worthy punchlines and flow variations than most rappers will deliver in a whole career.     Sure, this spellbinding stream of dirty dad jokes (""My dick's an acronym because it stands for you""), silly similes, and onomatopoeia doesn't add up to a grand statement, other than, yep, he's still manically deft with the pen. Here, Eminem is doubling-down on entendres, nimbly stacking and layering intricate labyrinths of crosswords built on cross words. He's an ADHD MC rhyming for the sake of riddlin'. But he's finding joy in the wordplay, nerding out in the nuance. The passion still itches, and it's contagious.     Other attempts feel more forced. There's ""Favorite Bitch"" (featuring Ty Dolla $ign), an extended hip-hop-as-woman metaphor that Common nailed way back in '94 with ""I Used to Love H.E.R."" And ""Gun Blazing,"" in which Em and Dre coldly dismiss real-life women who did them wrong.     More compelling are the two tracks produced by D.A. Got That Dope. Lead single ""Gnat,"" with its multiple beat switches (them horns at the end!), challenges our hero to adapt on the fly and comes parcelled with a fantastic Cole Bennett video. And ""Killer"" bubbles with a clubby vibe that allows Em to lay in the cut instead of trying to slash it to a pulp.     As far as the more sober pieces go, Em saves the best for last. ""Zeus"" (featuring an understated White Gold hook that works) features some introspective closet-cleaning (an apology to Rihanna; light jab at Snoop), a blast at murderous cops, and some sharp insight into the fleetingness of fame (""Next they'll be mentioning Future in the past tense"").     For his next act, it would be great to see Eminem give himself over to a single producer for an entire project. Or just drop a mixtape destroying other people's beats. Once he accepts the idea that no full-length will impact like  The Eminem Show  or  The Marshall Mathers LP , maybe he'll be free of the need to touch all the bases and please all the faces.

And while they have long been the  underdogs of Canadian rock , their third album has the kind of punched-up confidence and middle-finger swagger that says they don't intend to be underdogs much longer.    The Nil have always been hellbent on finding the world's loudest amplifier, and they just so happened to write some great tunes while they were at it. With  Fuck Art , the songs come first. It's still a towering wall of guitar rock, but it's built on an almost pop-oriented focus on consciously tight and catchy songwriting. Joined again by producer John Goodmanson, the band sounds even punchier than they did on  Master Volume . It's easily the band's most commercially viable recording (even with the F-bomb title).     Cuts like ""Blunt Force Concussion"" and ""Elvis '77"" make that abundantly clear; take Weezer's  Blue Album , throw in some heavy riffing and add Luke Bentham's precise, commanding voice, and you've got a recipe for rock radio.

Those are the bigger, wooden ones that you don't have to plug into an amp.)     What's also noticeable about the Dirty Nil's latest effort is their willingness to dress themselves up in a variety of costumes and play rock star with no shame. The band's flair has evolved from the boyish antics of blowing bubble gum and air-kicks to the razzle-dazzle of studded vests and pyrotechnics, and the music keeps pace. They've decided that they like classic rock, '80s thrash metal, '90s college-rock and modern pop-punk, and, screw it, they're gonna do it all.    ""Doom Boy"" throws Pantera riffs into a power-pop anthem, all while winking at the metalheads and hardcore kids by name-dropping Slayer, Turnstile and Cro-Mags. ""Ride or Die"" leans into the Motörhead mentality, while ""Hello Jealousy"" and ""Possession"" sound like the Replacements or the Gin Blossoms played with the high-volume showmanship of KISS. ""Done with Drugs"" rocks so hard that its critique of performative self-care is mostly inconsequential; what you've got instead is a ""Just Say No"" ad made for getting wasted.    They get away with it all by being good at it. Bentham is an electrifying leader, but you can't underestimate the impact of Ross Miller's thundering bass or Kyle Fisher's pounding, crashing drums. They also pull it off by just having fun with it. Still, they sometimes find themselves teetering on the edge of parody; think of the Darkness or, to use another Weezer comparison,  Make Believe .    But the Nil still have no intention of taking things very seriously. Created in a time of distress and despair,  Fuck Art  is pure escapism. Looking back 20 years from now, you'd have no idea it was made during one of the most world-changing events of the past century; the only thing apocalyptic about it is the ground-shaking sound of a cranked-up Marshall stack. These are songs about normal stuff: having fun, feeling old, falling in love, screwing it up, getting mad online and having your bike stolen.    The Dirty Nil have little regard for the potential to make music that changes the world. Their only allegiance is to a big, loud tune. Art says something. For the Dirty Nil, this isn't art. It's rock'n'roll. ( Dine Alone )                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Dirty Nil",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/the_dirty_nil_fuck_art_album_review
2021-01-06,Sarah Morrison,8,"JAZZ,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Viagra Boys Tear Themselves Open on Cathartic 'Welfare Jazz',,"Viagra Boys  have aggressively explored their past struggles, negative habits and self-defeats. Life as a musician is a road filled with temptation in multiple forms — it can be a hard lifestyle to find sanctuary in. On  Welfare Jazz , the Swedish post-punks open up this conversation and let out a sincere sigh from start to finish.    Opening track ""Ain't Nice"" is classic Viagra Boys: cacophonous and misanthropic. Lead singer Sebastian Murphy's tumultuous past takes a front seat, cohesively melding with the song's melodic tone. The song explores the theme of self-progression, projecting the instinctual thoughts that arise while stuck inside an unhealthy state of mind: ""Well, trust me honey, you don't want me / I'll start screaming if you look at me funny."" For those who have spiralled into a person they no longer recognize, ""Ain't Nice"" encapsulates the moment of truth to seek change.    A life of self-sabotage can be hard to admit, and Murphy has given himself the chance to depict the reality of his choices. The apologetic and intimate ""Into the Sun"" finds Murphy ready to confess his wrongdoings. ""What kind of person have I become,"" he pleads. ""Now that I can see everything, the way that it was, I would do anything to take back the things I have done."" It's the first time Murphy has peeled back the layers to reveal a fuller, more emotional connection from someone who has, until now, given off the appearance of a charismatic, stumbling drunk: ""I promise I've changed a lot, I've destroyed the old me.""    Further into the record, Murphy demonstrates other areas of his life where he has begun to find success, championing his strengths and accomplishments through sobriety. In ""I Feel Alive,"" Murphy is proud of change and triumph, finding power in emotional and mental success: ""I haven't felt like this in quite a while / Feel like a new man, yeah, such a better guy.""     The album occasionally takes the foot off the gas, to great effect. As Viagra Boys have done on previous releases,  Welfare Jazz  also features a handful of interludes, a breath of fresh air from the smoky, heavy din of its basement mosh pits. The album ends with a cover of John Prine's ""In Spite of Ourselves,"" featuring Aussie rocker Amy Taylor of  Amyl and the Sniffers . Expanding the band's palette of musical expressions, the song's country twang and call-and-response vocals showcase promising new versatility from the band.     Welfare Jazz  is, at its core, an open letter of acceptance and the resurrection of a lost soul. Murphy gives himself the chance to be vulnerable, to free himself from any regret he might have once held onto from his past. While still lighthearted and filled with humour, it's a massive shift from previous releases, both musically and lyrically, with plenty of hints of more to come.

2021-01-04,Kyle Mullin,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC",Steve Earle and the Dukes' 'J.T.' Is a Fitting Send-Off to Justin Townes Earle,,"Tumultuous as their relationship was,  Steve Earle  clearly reveres his son  Justin Townes Earle  as a songwriter. Years after Steve (himself a recovering addict) fired Justin from  the Dukes  due to Justin's struggles with addiction, and months after  Justin's death of a drug overdose , comes  J.T. , a new tribute album released on what would have been Justin's 39th birthday.    Over the first 10 tracks, the country legend passionately interprets Justin's deep cuts and fan faves alike. Steve's takes on ""Harlem River Blues"" and ""They Killed John Henry,"" from Justin's circa-2010 critical heyday, are as raucously upbeat and unabashedly old school as the originals. Better still: his careful attention to Justin's overlooked early work. Nearly half of  J.T.  sports tracks from Justin's first LP, 2008's  The Good Life . ""Lone Pine Hill"" carries the spirit of Justin's original version, itself written in the spare, hauntingly literary tradition of Steve's songwriting mentor and Justin's namesake, Townes Van Zandt. Here, Steve honours both Townes' legacies, a sentiment that Steve makes palpable in his rendition.     The Good Life  highlight ""Turn Out My Lights"" is also a key track on  J.T.  — it blooms from a breakup ballad into a mourner's hymn thanks to Steve's deftly tender tonal and lyrical tweaks. The Dukes bring further heft to the cover thanks to Eleanor Whitmore's heart-wrenching fiddling and the fresh wound throb of Ricky Ray Jackson and Brad Pemberton's respective pedal steel and percussion. Those elements sharply contrast with Justin's threadbare first go-around (which he penned when he was merely 16, as if to prove himself prodigious enough to be named Townes).    Listeners will be brought to further cathartic tears by the album's sole original song. Steve closes J.T. with ""Last Words,"" writing its lyrics with appropriately plain sincerity, and softening his famous rasp with hushed singing, as Jackson's dobro and Whitmore's fiddle resound beyond this life.    All that being said, fans should also bear in mind  Justin and Steve's cameo on  Treme , David Simon's New Orleans-set sleeper hit TV series. That's because the older Earle brings the jubilation of a Big Easy funeral march to much of  J.T.  He eagerly makes room for Justin's wryly metaphorical ""Champagne Corolla"" and keeps pace with his son's breathlessly loquacious ""I Don't Care."" Steve also makes a southern rock stomper of Justin's stab at Memphis Soul, ""Maria.""    ""The record is called  J.T.  because Justin was never called anything else until he was nearly grown. Well, when he was little, I called him Cowboy,"" Steve said in a press release. By not only fearlessly facing grief, but also honouring Justin's sly humor, raw vulnerability and nimble songwriting, Steve Earle fittingly sees his young Cowboy off into the sunset.

2021-01-11,Owen Morawitz,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",'Drunk Tank Pink' Showcases Shame's Talent for Vivid Storytelling,,"In the world of  Shame 's  Drunk Tank Pink , perception is everything.    Opener ""Alphabet"" kicks off with rattling snare and lurching rhythms from drummer Charlie Forbes and bassist Josh Finerty. Guitarists Sean Coyle-Smith and Eddie Green pepper the empty space with scattershot sustain and siren wail leads. Grinding against this hypnotic lockstep, Charlie Steen shouts out sardonic observations drawn from urban anthropology. The frontman sounds like he's walking the midnight streets of South London, perturbed by every empty lot, gentrified pub and decrepit nook and cranny of corporeal existence. Eventually, the track's chorus gets to the core of Steen's innermost anxieties — ""Are you waiting to feel good? / Are you praying like you should?"" It's a catchy line that ultimately serves to mask the darkness underneath; Steen might not be alone, but he feels like he is.    Following their debut LP, 2018's exceptional  Songs of Praise , Shame were one of Britain's most hyped bands when the members were barely in their twenties. The group's snotty post-punk brand, coupled with Steen's withering social commentary and laconic delivery, garnered them critical acclaim. While their first album was the perfect platform for pent-up frustrations and post-adolescent rage, it's clear that their follow-up effort is the product of onset adulthood. Drawing its title from a book by Adam Alter,  Drunk Tank Pink  interrogates how our environment unconsciously shapes our perceptions, conditions our judgments and informs our idea of selfhood. For Steen and his bandmates, it's an album that wrestles with the pressure of performance, reflecting on how life on the road impacts your ability to enjoy life at home.     Drunk Tank Pink  manifests these anxieties through an instrumental identity crisis, adding shades of '80s pop and funk to otherwise angular post-punk soundscapes. There's an upbeat immediacy to ""Nigel Hitter"" that sounds like Talking Heads in their prime. ""Born in Luton"" bristles with alternate guitar tunings and pedal effects; this use of sonic overload contrasts with Steen's sense of confusion and despair at the dissolution of his relationships — ""I've been waiting outside for all of my life / And now I've got to the door, there's no one inside / When are you coming back? / When are you coming home?""    Thankfully, it's not all doom and gloom. The album's mid-section brings back the cheeky grins and pub-band charisma that dominated the band's debut. Single ""Water in the Well"" makes the most of jagged riffs and Steen's effortless street-corner swagger. On the Arctic Monkeys-aping ""March Day,"" the vocalist references ""the womb"" — a hidden room in Steen and Coyle-Smith's shared living space in South, East London, painted in the shade of pink used to calm down drunk tank inmates — as the only place where he can calm his mind and put the album's themes into action.    While the constant need for creative freedom and instrumental variety means that  Drunk Tank Pink  begins to meander towards the record's back end, a handful of sprawling epics showcase Shame's enviable talent for vivid storytelling. The expansive ""Snow Day"" pushes and pulls with the band's propulsive instrumentation and Steen's gritted-teeth recitations. Meanwhile, wistful album closer ""Station Wagon"" constructs a towering crescendo that allows Steen's poetic lyrics to let the light in. And here, just for the briefest of moments, he almost sounds content, ""Happiness is only a habit / And if that's true, then I'm habitually dependent on something that I cannot control / Something I cannot touch, taste, or tamper with / But no one said this was going to be easy.""  ( Dead Oceans )                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   MUSIC   ALBUM              More Shame",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/shame_drunk_tank_pink_album_review
2021-01-11,Veracia Ankrah,8,"EP,REVIEWS,R&B,ALBUM,MUSIC","Jazmine Sullivan Explores Love, Sex and Money in the Instagram Age on 'Heaux Tales'",,"Jazmine Sullivan 's  Heaux Tales  plays like a late-night, wine-infused discussion amongst girlfriends about the sincere moments that yield the grey area between love and lust. The Philadelphia native divinely couples a series of intimate confessions with painfully honest, spine-tingling ballads that situate secular sex anecdotes as the gospel at church. Preaching to the choir, every song captures junctures that are birthed by the rose-coloured eyes of romance — where insecurities are heightened and desire is a driving force that either leads to nights of empowerment or regret.     On ""Bodies (Intro),"" Sullivan illustrates a woman's internal dialogue while in a questionable circumstance with a man she has no business spending the night with. Despite societal pressures, she is unapologetic and describes her newfound liberation on ""Pick Up Your Feelings.""  Heaux Tales ' greatest takeaway is ""On It,"" featuring  Ari Lennox , whose voice melts into Sullivan's like butter, both emphasizing the agency of the modern-day woman who is unafraid to demand all forms of intimacy — especially when advocating for her own pleasure.    The second half of the project steers away from a woman reluctantly owning her sexual freedom to the thoughts that creep in after she's 'set free' of society's crippling sexist chokehold. Whether through marriage or some other entanglement, ""money keeps the pussy wet,"" says Sullivan on ""Pricetags,"" where she explores the intricacies of currency in relationships with the help of  Anderson .Paak . ""The Other Side"" drives the importance of money home, sharing a woman's dream of meeting a millionaire and using her looks as currency. Finally,  Heaux Tales  explores the impact of luxury lifestyles on Instagram. On ""Girl Like Me,"" Sullivan and  H.E.R.  grapple with the notion that lavish symbolism has entered the zeitgeist and whether chasing the fast life is ultimately the way to get ahead.    Sullivan is often overlooked as the R&B master she is, but her latest project displays the vocal range of legends before her, demonstrating her ability to capture the qualms of life and love relevant to the realities of dating in the age of the internet.

2020-12-01,Sydney Brasil,7,"POP AND ROCK,MUSIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS",Lee Paradise Makes the Post-Apocalyptic Future Sound Inviting on 'The Fink',,"The Fink   is eerily inviting for a record that explores a world where humans have ceased to exist. Daniel Lee's first album in seven years under his  Lee Paradise  moniker, the  Hooded Fang  and Phèdre member continues to make delicately layered tracks that sound as if they come from another dimension. Recorded in between Berlin and Toronto, Lee still keeps his post-pop identity while dabbling in funk and hip-hop.    Musically,  The Fink  is extremely well balanced; the heavy reverberation of Lee's vocals lends a sense of open space, while his melodies act as a tour guide on this intergalactic journey. On top of this, the roaring, funk-inspired basslines drive these songs forward. This is indicative of how well mixed this record is. The haziness of the rest of the instrumentation brings the bass to the forefront, making it a point of clear focus. This is especially apparent on ""Message to the Past"" — a danceable single which heavily relies on the groove of the bass.    This idea of an alternate universe is scattered throughout, giving enough imagery to imagine yourself there without pigeonholing the listening experience. The dripping guitar on ""A Present to Ponder"" reflects its call to start ""dancing in the afterlife"" as the synths beam you onto the mothership.    Overall,  The Fink 's rhythmic energy plays into its paranoid curiosity. The world Lee is creating is a post-apocalyptic one — its anxious aura mirroring the uncertainty of the world today. In a way, it's accepting of an impending apocalypse.

2020-12-01,Max Heilman,8,"REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Sigur Rós Rediscover a Piece of Their Own Mythology on 'Odin's Raven Magic',,"Sigur Rós  had begun work on 2002's  ()  when fellow Icelandic musician and religious figurehead Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson approached them about adapting a chapter from the 13th-century epic poem  Edda . Two weeks later, the  Odin's Raven Magic  collaboration was ready for a handful of performances — one notably in Paris at La Grande Halle de la Villette. The group captured a stereo mix recording of that night in 2005, but disappointment with the would-be visual component resulted in its 15-year hibernation. This unique chapter of Sigur Rós' history now reveals itself, revitalizing Old Norse mythology with exquisite modern classical music.     Odin's Raven Magic  is not Sigur Rós proper. Only the euphoric modulations and bouncy rhythms of ""Dvergmál"" come close to the band's sound — one of four tracks with Jónsi's iconic falsetto. The song also introduces one of the album's centrepieces: a stone marimba built by Páll Guðmundsson. This lithophone defines much of this album's sound, along with strings, horns and choirs orchestrated by Sigur Rós' then-pianist/arranger Kjartan Sveinsson and his partner Maria Huld Markan Sigfúsdóttir. The duo's work imbues opener ""Prologus"" with transfixing swells and crescendos.    Sigur Rós and Hilmarsson sought the help of local fisherman and renowned chanter Steindór Andersen to handle the poetry. His traditional folk singing echoes within the droning dissonance of ""Alföður orkar,"" providing intimate fervency on which the sweeping bombast of the choir, strings and brass can build. Vast, overwhelming climaxes embody the poem's apocalyptic premonitions and banqueting gods, while Andersen's lonesome melodies embody the human tragedies that result from cosmic calamities.    ""Hvert stefnir"" and ""Stendur æva"" incorporate Andersen's chanting into staccato marimba lines, creating an aura as unique as it is hypnotic. The classical elements levitate the music to the gates of Asgard, but each shift in dynamics and instrumentation can still trace back to a simple, emotive vocal pattern. Even Jónsi's angelic singing serves the poem's multifaceted melancholy, as he and Andersen play off each other naturally during the song's last moments.    Even without Andersen and Jónsi, this album's concept remains potent. From field recordings and a hushed electronic pulse, ""Áss hinn hvíti"" creeps over the horizon with forlorn brass melodies and choral layerings. The drama is worthy of  Beowulf  and Tolkien, but still breaks down to a folk tune made for singing at the northernmost waterfront. To that effect, ""Spár eða spakmál"" features Sveinsson and Sigfúsdóttir's lushest compositions, but ends with the return of Jónsi and Andersen's duet from ""Stendur æva."" Closer ""Dagrenning"" drives home the performance's sonic through line by reintroducing motifs from ""Alföður orkar.""     Odin's Raven Magic 's final crescendo finds Sigur Rós' full-band instrumentation bolstering an orchestral wall of sound in a massive tour de force. Those last three minutes are the most post-rock-y this album ever sounds. This isn't a Sigur Rós album, and that's just fine. Lack of reverb-soaked bowed guitars notwithstanding, this collaboration vividly reimagines a bastion of medieval Icelandic poetry. The only issue is how long it spent under wraps.

Lonely Boa) refuses to be boring. With a delightfully dizzying blend of baroque pop, synthetic soundscapes and dance beats,  Chrysalia  transforms as it progresses, showcasing Finley's virtuosity as a composer. Channelling Final Fantasy-era Owen Pallett — particularly the playful spirit and insistent violins of ""Has a Good Home"" — Finley oscillates from lush, pulsing pieces to atmospheric escapes, allowing  Chrysalia  to twist and turn without ever losing its footing.    Although Finley's tentative vocals appear in the corners of this album, she often lets her well-curated balance of acoustic and electronic instruments do the talking. On ""Clouds,"" for instance, Finley builds a whirlwind of subtle drum loops, encircling violins and cascading synths, only to bring the piece back to the dance floor with unexpected electropop pulses. This piece epitomizes her ability to meld unlikely sonic environments, providing several songs that manage to sound, in equal parts, like a cèilidh, a low-key rave and a chamber music concert.    Across its 10 tracks,  Chrysalia 's most notable feature is its versatility. This is showcased when the 3-minute mellow instrumental ""Droney Discord"" slides into album highlight ""The Rules"" — a powerful, purposeful centrepiece driven by insistent violin loops (à la Steve Reich).    Beginning with the introspective string swells of ""Meditation #2"" and culminating in the saxophone-propelled indie rock explosion of ""Toy Animal Contemplates Life,""  Chrysalia  is defined by its ability to metamorphosize — it's quite the treat when an album invites you to shapeshift.

Despite the pandemic, Sadek has been steadily releasing new material this year, starting with ""The Faithless"" and ""Mechanic"" singles. Now, he's let loose  The Serapeum , his first EP since 2014's  The Malefic: Chapter III .    Sadek's revolving collaborators are the crème de la crème of the metal world, having included Steve Tucker (Morbid Angel), Alex Skolnick (Testament), Trym (Emperor), Flo Mounier (Cryptopsy) and Rune Eriksen (Mayhem). This time, he plays alongside Karl Sanders (Nile), Derek Roddy (Serpents Rise) and Mahmud Gecekusu (Perversion).     A serapeum is an ancient temple dedicated to Serapis, the Egyptian god of fertility and the afterlife. Wanting to commune with the ancient spirits, Sadek actually recorded the vocals inside the Red Pyramid at Dahshur, sneaking audio equipment into the inner chamber. Backed by Sanders and his career-long Egyptian vision in Nile, the new material is forward-thinking death metal augmented with black metal elements and Middle Eastern embellishments.    ""The Serapeum: Black Osiris"" is high-powered death with furious guitar licks and blast beats, slowing down to a crawl that reeks of millennia-old bones. Nadek's guttural vociferations echo throughout the subterranean burial chambers in the brusque ""ReSarcophogus."" The swirling guitar tones of the intro to ""The Serapeum: Polluted Waters"" resemble Monster Magnet phoning in from a distant astral plane, but when the song lurches into brutality mode, Morbid Angel and Behemoth are immediately invoked. Technical death ensues in the final track, a searing live version of ""The Serapeum.""    Sadek delivers the expected savagery but with plenty of black-metal intrigue on  The Serapeum , which is another step closer to his second full-length,  The Malefic , due for release in 2021.

2020-12-08,Alisha Mughal,8,"MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Edmonton's Yes Nice Kindle Yacht Rock's 'Eternal Flame',,"Yacht rock is like if disco and folk had a super chill baby. Not so much to be danced to as it is a soundtrack to sweet, calm thoughts by the pool, yacht rock inspires a rhythmic sway of the hips and the whisper of a smile. Edmonton duo  Yes Nice' s latest,  Eternal Flame , is a throwback to this genre borne of the soul, jazz, and disco of the '70s, but with a modern twist. Infusing a bit of existential angst into their lyrics,  Eternal Flame  reignites a classic genre that manages to contextualize it steadily in the present.    Yes Nice members Scott McKellar and Nathaniel Wong have been writing and recording together since 1998 and  Eternal Flame  is their third album. Their previous albums have a curious and unique sound, but what makes  Eternal Flame  distinct for mainstream audiences is its element of nostalgia – it conjures up a hazy image in your mind even if you weren't around for the '70s.    The album is stunningly written and produced, with each track an earworm, liable to get you nodding your head or swaying to the beat even if you can't make out the lyrics precisely. ""Piggy Piggy Pig,"" which rolls sleepily with its twanging guitar and insistent keyboard, and the bass-heavy ""Glistening Pigs,"" with lyrics that harken back to the mind-bending wordplay of the Beatles' ""I Am the Walrus."" Meanwhile, second track ""Few Words to Say"" would fit comfortably in the opening credits of a film like  Shampoo . This is all to say,  Eternal Flame  is without reproach insofar as it honours its yacht rock inspirations, and insofar as McKellar and Wong's skills are concerned.    Where it forges its own path, however, is the febrile ground on which the lyrics stand. While the music has a distinct ancestor, the lyrics themselves waver from past to present, existing in a liminal space. An overall feeling of confusion — with regard to place, relationships, self — in face of an aimlessness undergirds the words that Wong sings beautifully. This existential angst is most palpable on ""Hollywood Hills,"" with its lyrics speaking of paranoia, working without purpose (""I bring home the paycheque / trying to remember your face""), and faded love. The feeling threaded through the album can best be described as knowing for sure that you're about to lose something (a person, a memory, a feeling), but doing everything you can to hold on to it — a futile labour.    The music, with its funky bass, beautiful blooming electric guitar, and confident horn, is, paradoxically, a perfect companion to the introspective, sometimes sad lyrics. A more meandering, strings-heavy rhythm would have turned every track into a ballad, but  Eternal Flame  has an attitude. ""Follow a Star"" best embodies this idea — beginning like Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time,"" it takes on a poppy urgency with its drums and keys, but the lyrics speak of a ""reflection in the gutter,"" reining the track back into the shadows, away from the love song its beginning portended, taking it all back to the self, to existential dread.    All of these songs will get stuck in your head, as they should.  Eternal Flame  is a gem that reinvigorates its genre without emulating the past, adding something to the conversation and thereby making it better. Give it a listen, you won't be disappointed.

It's fitting, then, that this final record merely goes by the first names of the final four:  Tim Melina Theo Bobby .

In switching off between Tim's warbling, smoky whispers and Ausikaitis' sneering, hypnotic jabs, Joan of Arc take on an urgent edge to make their last hurrah visceral and exciting.     On this final endeavour, Joan of Arc flawlessly mix industrial, electronic and traditional indie guitar rock elements with masterful songwriting. This wildly varied sonic palette keeps the album unendingly fresh, even upon many repeated listens. A brooding and slow electronic-acoustic moment like ""Creature and Being"" can quickly give way to darkly groovy, roiling instrumentals like ""Land Surveyor"" and ""The Dawn of Something."" There's a bravery in calling it quits while many other 90s contemporary acts (Hum, American Football) are just now reclaiming their former glory, but Joan of Arc make it all seem so easy and essential.     Singles like ""Something Kind"" simmer just below the surface, with fuzzy guitars and pounding drum choruses alternating with Ausikaitis' stripped back electronic and percussive verses until the guitars finally boil over into a fiery conclusion. Kinsella's own performances are varied and dynamic here, too. Later album cut ""Cover Letter Song"" uses industrial percussion and drilling bass synths along with Kinsella's half-sung, half-rapped mundane descriptions of his various occupations. ""I wrote songs / I mopped floors / I scrubbed toilets / and I wrote"" he whines, at odds as he immediately proclaims, ""I'm gonna be the next Tim Kinsella.""    Album highlight, and closer ""Upside Down Bottomless Pit"" uses dissonance to end this band's 25-year run on an off-putting, darkly funny note. Every element of the tune threatens to upend the entire song, as Kinsella's smoky rasps manage to bundle the eerie, disparate  package together.     If other musicians are looking for a perfect swan song execution, let this be the benchmark. Tasteful inclusions of every kind, powerful melodies and dense, wry lyrics make  Tim Melina Theo Bobby  an unmissable conclusion for fans of Midwest emo, electronic rock, and strong songwriting.

2020-12-08,Ian Gormely,8,"EP,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Ryan Hemsworth Brings His Love of Emo to the Fore on 'Quarter-Life Crisis',,"Though he's most often considered an electronic artist, indie rock and pop-punk have been regular influences in  Ryan Hemsworth 's music for years. Since 2013's  A lone for the First Time , Hemsworth has slowly pushed his music in more songwriter-friendly directions while his  RyanPack  mixes simultaneously maintain his cred as a DJ and producer while doubling as a showcase for his somewhat incongruous musical pedigree.     Quarter-Life Crisis , the self-titled EP from  Hemsworth's new moniker , is his most explicit attempt to blend these two worlds to date. Guest vocalists have played an increasingly important role on his records, but this project explicitly pulls singers from the indie-emo nexus. Hop Along's Frances Quinlan, Meg Duffy (as Hand Habits) and Hovvdy's Chris Martin all make appearances, singing over production that neither mirrors the work of their day jobs nor shoehorns them into someone else's sound.    Rather, Hemsworth proves deft at writing for others without abandoning his core aesthetics. Guitars figure prominently, as do live drums. But there are enough subtle production tricks, guitar effects, a swirling background atmosphere and an overall melancholic tone that remind you who's in the driver's seat — ""Fatigue,"" the record's lone instrumental, seem to be Hemsworth's way of illustrating this point.    Quinlan, probably the most idiosyncratic singer on the record, leads the EP's biggest highlight, ""Postcard from Spain."" But even lesser known collaborators like Claud and Yohuna are given the space to put their stamp on their contributions.    It's unclear why Hemsworth decided to use a pseudonym for this project. It hews close enough to his work under his own name that it was unlikely to confuse fans and each singer's contribution seems to be a one-off rather than an extended collaboration. Regardless,  Quarter-Life Crisi s is another winner is Hemsworth's winding road of a career.

Helmed by JUNO award-winner Eric Mehlsen on guitar, the group is rounded out by MC Info Red, MC and producer Origin of Spin, and singer-songwriters Nini Jegz and ADEOLUWA, with additional support from the versatile keys of Ethan Reoch, the in-the-pocket drumming of Cyprian Henry, and the bass hooks of Rob Lane. Given the broad range of talent in this band, collectively this cohesive eight-piece work to create a sonic imprint most comparable to the Roots or, reaching back further, Arrested Development, while also achieving a sound that is uniquely all their own.      Recorded entirely live,  Last Day of Summer  creates a great deal of its beauty and originality from its imperfections. It has an organic, spontaneous feel akin to an old Motown one-and-done style. It's an old school reel-to-reel souns that makes the recording ""real"" — the vocals can be at pitchy at times, the MCs take audible breaths, the solos sometimes stray mildly from the chord changes, but this is what is part of the EP's charm; it's an exact snapshot of a specific moment in musical time and, in this day and age, raw honesty in music can be a rare gem.    Kicking off with the infectious energy of ""The Lick,""  Last Day of Summer  works best when the band lay back and take on a medium-tempo groove, which is highlighted on tracks like ""Sunday Cruise"" or ""Lift Ya Head."" In truth, though, every song is memorable, given the variety of musicians on the stage; the whole thing is imbued with hooks — it's essentially a shiny slice of positivity. People of the Sun are coming along at just the right time to get us through these dark winter months.

2020-12-11,Kaelen Bell,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS",Danny Bell & His Disappointments Bring Big Feelings to Small-City Living on 'Songs for the Town',,"An accordion's magic lies in its wonky instability. Even expertly played, there remains the feeling that one miscounted note or mashed key will send it all crashing down. It's that kinetic energy and wheezing effort that drives  Songs for the Town , the second full-length from Prince George, BC's Danny Bell & His Disappointments. The record is defined by the clipped inhale-exhale of Bell's accordion, as much as it is his particular worldview —  Songs for the Town  is an anti-capitalist, anti-elitist, anti-asshole folk record for small moments and small places.     Bell's songs are rich with dark with and peculiar observations on every passing frustration, minor regret or imagined thought — the stuff that floats by in the ether and sticks in your mind. While  Songs for the Town  is sometimes quietly blue or yearning, Bell always manages to toe the line between tragedy and comedy. Sad-dog songs like ""Old Toyota"" or ""The Longest Walk"" are both goofy and genuinely touching; his songs might be funny, but they're never jokes.     There's a sly political bent to Bell's conversational yarns on this record, with little stories that touch on big ideas, such as pollution, mill-town pride and the Canadian citizenship blues. The music has a hard-eyed edge too — its chants and bar-room melodies giving way to a frenzied swirl that edges toward cow-punk on ""Good Canadian"" or a folk-metal churn on the penultimate ""Riverbank."" The aforementioned track, along with closer ""Safe on the Hart"" — with its shimmering clouds of accordion and violin — are the record's unquestionable peaks; the two songs best exemplify Bell's knack for winking commentary laced with real feeling.     Songs for the Town  is an insular record made for a particular place and particular people, but it speaks to something more; it speaks on where we come from, what makes a home, work, friends and lonely dogs.  ( Good Egg Records  )                           FOLK AND COUNTRY   MUSIC   ALBUM   REVIEWS              More Danny Bell",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/danny_bell_and_his_disappointments_songs_for_the_town_album_review
2020-12-11,Kerry Doole,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Kacy & Clayton and Marlon Williams Find Organic Beauty with 'Plastic Bouquet',,"Here's a Commonwealth collaboration of three of the brightest talents in roots music. Saskatchewan folk duo  Kacy & Clayton  — cousins Kacy Anderson and Clayton Linthicum — have struck up both a musical and personal friendship with New Zealand troubadour  Marlon Williams . Together, the trio grabbed some time together a couple years ago in Saskatoon to lay down  Plastic Bouquet .    The album is built around the contrasting yet complementary voices of Anderson and Williams. The former has a pure folk-rooted sound, while the Kiwi has a more expansive and eclectic style. There is plenty of variety in the vocal arrangements of the tunes, with Anderson and Williams taking turns on lead, swapping verses and harmonizing in sweet fashion. You'll occasionally be reminded of the work of Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris — never a bad thing.    The pair trade verses on ""Old Fashioned Man"" — a retro country tune embellished by pedal steel and walking bass, while Williams' rich and buttery voice is neatly showcased on a couple of album highlights, ""I Wonder Why"" and ""Arahura."" Anderson takes charge on ""Your Mind's Walking Out"" and the moving title track, a poignant tribute to car crash victims that evokes ""a cross by the highway with the plastic bouquet."" Clocking in at just under two minutes, ""I'm Unfamiliar"" seems a mite under-developed. Linthicum's multi-instrumental accompaniment throughout is both tasteful and effective.    In its entirety, the collaborative effort is compelling;  Plastic Bouquet  is the furthest thing from a plastic collection.

2020-11-24,Kyle Kohner,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Megan Thee Stallion Stands Above Her Peers on 'Good News',,"With unabashed raunchiness, shoot-to-kill confidence, and dizzying wordplay, rapper  Megan Thee Stallion  has been too often described as the ""female version"" of Southern hip-hop legends like Juicy J and her biggest influence, Pimp C. It's time to stop with the lazy and sexist comparisons and take Megan for what she is — a singular talent with more gusto and guts than most rappers out there, and her long-awaited debut album (following up the  Suga   EP from earlier this year) is unmistakable proof of her increasingly towering presence over the rest of the game.    Coming mere months after  she was allegedly shot by Tory Lanez , Megan answers all questions on the aptly titled opener ""Shots Fired."" Without mentioning Lanez by name, Megan unflinchingly tears into him against a sample of Biggie's ""Who Shot Ya,"" launching an aerial strike of disses zeroed in on the abuser's head and his apologists. Calling Lanez ""A pussy n**** with a pussy gun in his feelings,"" this track brims with bloodthirsty one-liners, which happens to be the case through the majority of the album.    Loaded with bars fueled by female empowerment and raunchy wisecracks like ""Fucked him good, now he shakin', call that n**** Crazy Legs"" on ""Movie,"" the fire-spitting phenom ensures every line leaves an impression. Try listening to Megan rap ""Moaning like a bitch when he hit this pussy / Damn, he probably wanna wear my hoodie"" on ""Cry Baby"" without laughing.       While Megan's  ""Hot Girl Summer""  mantra is clear as ever, her party-girl braggadocio feels more nuanced by recent tragedy. Yes, listeners are blasted with sex-positive bangers that bounce from wall-to-wall, like the infectious ""Body,"" which will surely be gentrified by White TikTok in the coming days, but these moments are made human next to moments like ""Circles"" where she reflects on recent trauma: ""Bullet wounds, backstabs, mama died, still sad / At war with myself, in my head...""    Though a 50-minute runtime isn't grueling on paper, its 17-song tracklist makes it feel longer than it really is. Sure, the Beyonce-featuring remix of  Suga  track ""Savage"" goes as hard as anything released this year, and, yes, ""Girls In the Hood"" is a refreshing take on Eazy-E's ""Boyz-n-the-Hood."" But when considering these singles were released what seems like ages ago, they feel now like ultimately unnecessary to  Good News ' newer tracks. Additionally, Megan's robust flows overpower the presence of her star-studded list of features. Pairing her blistering talents with sleepier one-trick ponies like Lil Durk, Big Sean and DaBaby, dampens the hype coursing through the album.    But even with some slight shortcomings, Megan's reclamation of tragedy is refreshing. In a year where any good news has been hard to find, the bar-busting Texan, full of raw charisma and energy, is every bit of good news. Near tragedy may have struck Megan early this year, but she's won't allow it, nor any haters and toxic men, to define her present and certainly not her bright future.

2020-11-24,Conor Lochrie,7,"ALBUM,MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS",Mike Edel Shows the Value of Collaboration on 'En Masse',,"Auteur theory does not sit well with Canadian musician  Mike Edel . He may be a solo artist, co-writing all of his songs, but his fourth album,  En Masse , is about discovery through the process of collaboration. It's the follow-up to 2019's  Thresholds  — the record that really started to focus eyes his way.    This spirit of collaboration informs the album lyrically and sonically (it also makes the album's title make more sense).  En Masse  saw production and mixing contributions from Marcus Paquin (The National, Arcade Fire) and Andy Park (The Head and the Heart, Noah Gundersen), and the rousing rhythm of some of those bands can be heard in Edel's tracks; the production is fulsome and illuminating without being overbearing.    The album constantly interchanges between exuberant pop and more melancholic rock. ""Hello Universe"" and ""Good About Everything"" make for a bright and sprightly one-two opening punch — the former containing a chorus that wouldn't sound amiss on a Foster the People record. They're immediately followed by the similarly upbeat and catchy ""Sunshine,"" featuring wishful lines like, ""I need a vacation / Just you and me in the sunshine.""    More often, though, Edel sounds lovelorn and forlorn: titles like ""Lose You,"" ""Still Thinking About You"" and ""Need You"" are self-explanatory, downtempo pieces after the flashy beginning. All maintain Edel's need for strong interpersonal connections; ""With you by my side, I can do anything,"" he cries on the acoustic tune ""Need You."" His strongest offering is ""Giving Up on Giving In,"" which appears melancholic upon first listen but is really Edel's quietly powerful ode to perseverance.     En Masse  might not deliver such sought-after stardom, but what it does do is show that strong pop-rock can thrive outside of the commercial charts.

With a sound reminiscent of No List Record bands like Anion and Shallow North Dakota, Cell Press' self-titled EP reminds its listener of sludge metal from the golden years.    Nothing stays the same on this EP for very long. From the grooves on ""Piss Police"" to the odd-timed melodic chords of ""Blacked Out in Verdun,"" everything moves in unexpected ways. All of this is perfectly set to the backdrop of PQ's uniquely cackled screams.    Drummer Mark Mcgee really flourishes on this EP. From his snare rolls on ""Blacked Out in Verdun"" to his intricate patterns on the noise track ""My Son Will No [sic] the Truth,"" the entirety of his skill set is on display. Perhaps none of this is more apparent than on the song ""Dead at OACI,"" which goes from pummelling double kick patterns into a variety of different fills to accompany the chaotic nature of this song.     Cell Press  is a great sludge metal EP that reminds the listener of the best aspects of this sub-genre. This EP makes the future appear bright for what is to come from this band.

Their debut record,  Red Marks , saw the group pop onto the radar of many with their dizzying mathcore-meets-sludge.  For the Love of It  sees the band further pushing these elements in a more refined manner, making it one of the best heavy albums fans will hear in 2020.    Femur's music is always unsettling in the best way possible. The odd-timed riffs of ""Unconditional"" and the Black Sheep Wall plod of ""Often & Softly"" highlight the ways that Femur are always able to bring the heavy through unconventional means. If you are looking for heavy riffs, Femur always deliver.    The unsung hero of this album is drummer Dylan Maxwell. His unconventional fills on ""Welcome Wind II"" and ""Brian Wells,"" or the straightforward pummelling of ""Gulazzi,"" showcase his talent for finding his way into any sort of pocket that is required of him.     For the Love of It  is an excellent addition into the canon of 2020 albums, and an incredible step forward for this Thunder Bay band.

Relive the Moment  revisits a selection of tracks off Lewis's debut record,  In the Moment , with alternate takes of new drum tracks. There's not a whole lot of new material, but the record still shows Lewis comfortably in his element, while looking for new ways to approach his own work.    Like any jazz drummer, Lewis rarely plays a chart the same way twice. Sometimes it's more overt, like how ""The City Lights"" opens with a more subdued approach, in contrast to the aggressive cymbal shots from the original recording. Sometimes it's more subtle, like new ideas for fills or new ways to play with his existing ideas. Although on the surface it feels like Lewis is simply covering his own songs, it still shows a musician continuing to find new ways to reimagine his catalogue.    While  Relive the Moment  presents a great avenue for a player of Lewis's calibre to really dig in and experiment with his solo material in new ways, the record still serves as a great showcase of his strengths, even if it might leave fans of his work wanting more.

With that being said: after reuniting the ""classic"" lineup of his iconic band (which just meant rehiring  Jimmy Chamberlin  after a two-album absence and bringing back  James Iha ),  Billy Corgan  has recorded this double album — it's similar in scope to  Mellon Collie   and the   Infinite Sadness ,  comes off as a spiritual sequel to   Adore , and also counts as the second release in a series under the clumsy qualifier of  Shiny and Oh So Bright .    What is important to know about   Cyr , however, is how large of a swing Corgan takes here; its ambition is virtually the album's only redeeming quality. As a keyboard-heavy, 20-track/72-minute release, the Pumpkins' eleventh LP is both familiar in its structure, as well as a pleasant departure from the Terry Date/Rick Rubin-produced proggy, hard-rock Corgan has been peddling over the past 13 years. For a musician who has been able to create such soaring and grandiose sounds from his instruments in the past, Billy Corgan, in his role of songwriter/producer, has made an extraordinarily flat and thin-sounding collection of songs, with only the symphonic ""Wyttch"" and the gothic ""Black Forest, Black Hills"" coming off dynamic and sonically adventurous.    Joined by country pop artist Katie Cole and former Black Eyed Peas collaborator Sierra Swan,  Cyr  seems to be Corgan's attempt at making an accessible album — saturated with vocal effects, enveloped production and programmed beats. But the synth sound, perhaps the most promising and frustrating aspect of the album, adds great depth to tracks like the moody ""Dulcet in E"" and buoyant ""Purple Blood,"" but comes off gaudy on ""Save Your Tears"" and ""Tyger, Tyger.""    The fact that the band have already released ten tracks from the album before its release supports the idea that there are no real standout tracks here, but there's also no stinkers. Most of the material just hovers around the same tempo, tone, lyrical style and sound dynamics, robbing the listener of any sort of emotional peaks or valleys that are so important when floating a double album. It's simply a shame that the execution of  Cyr  fails to match the naked ambition Corgan's concepts promised.

BTS (consisting of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook) hadn't planned on dropping another album this year. Following the release of  Map of the Soul: 7  in February, the group was getting ready to embark on a world tour, but when  COVID-19  halted their plans, BTS decided to buckle down and make new music together.     BE  consists of eight succinct songs — seven if you don't count ""Skit"" — that evoke frustration, hopefulness and a steady love for their fanbase, widely known as the ARMY.    Opening track and lead single ""Life Goes On"" is a necessary reminder that, even though this year feels like a never-ending garbage fire, things will get better —they always do. BTS have always stressed the importance of togetherness through their music, and this song is no different. Compared to the other tracks on  BE , the acoustic guitar and 808 drums make this an easy listening experience. ""Fly to My Room"" and ""Dis-ease"" are two other hopeful tunes. The bright hip-hop fusion vibe disguises the quarantine frustration the boys initially express. When you can't go anywhere, your home becomes your sanctuary. The latter is a fun, retro, hip-hop song about staying hopeful even when times are uncertain.     BTS aren't known for writing tearjerkers, but ""Blue and Grey"" is heartbreaking. The depression and burnout conveyed in the lyrics are all too relatable. While sad, it's refreshing to see a K-pop group openly singing about mental health issues. ""Telepathy"" and ""Stay"" are both funky, dance-in-your-room songs dedicated to their massive and loyal ARMY. As a group who never fail to thank those responsible for their success, BTS are always writing songs for their fans.    While  BE  is a slight departure from BTS's usual offerings, its more matter-of-fact and laidback vibe could pull in new fans who are looking for music to relate to in this crappy year.

It's been four years since the band's last studio release, 2016's  Decision Day , so while another album was essentially due this year,  Genesis XIX  is a significant one for a number of reasons. First, and most excitingly, this is the first album since Sodom's 1989 classic  Agent Orange  to feature Frank Blackfire on guitar. He and vocalist-bassist Tom Angelripper, Sodom's only constant member, are joined for this outing by newcomers Yorck Segatz and Toni Merkel on rhythm guitar and drums, respectively, making  Genesis XIX  the first Sodom album ever to be recorded by a quartet and not a trio.     No time is wasted cutting to the chase here, and after a minute-long buildup in album intro ""Blind Superstition,"" ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" comes out flailing its fists and reminding us all how much better a place the world will be when we can finally get back in a mosh pit. From there, it just keeps on getting heavier and more gung-ho, the hostility barely ever taking a break for so much as a few seconds, even on the album's slower moments. The dual guitars are a nice touch this time around, and while Merkel's drums are solid and Angelripper's vocals are as menacing as ever, it's the riffs that really make this record.    Part of  The Big Teutonic 4 , Germany's grittier counterparts to the U.S.A.'s ""big four"" of thrash metal, Sodom are long past the point of needing to prove themselves, and there's never any doubt about what a new album will contain. There's no thrash custom that can't be found in abundance on  Genesis XIX , and there's not much more to it than that. Of course, one could accuse the band of just doing the same old thing over again, but their fans aren't likely to be bothered at all by this at all.

2020-11-26,Anthony Boire,6,"METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS","Intervals' 'Circadian' Is Triumphant, Technical and One-Dimensional",,"Instrumental progressive metal is often at odds with its own intentions. Dense, fast passages that call to classical music more than metal are folded in with with brutal sonic palettes, boiling down into a pummelling and awe-inspiring potion of heaviness and headiness.     Intervals , the mostly-instrumental progressive metal project fronted now entirely by Aaron Marshall, doesn't attempt to change that paradigm with his latest release,  Circadian . After a set of EPs, Intervals released their well-received debut,  A Voice Within , in 2014, which included Mike Semesky on vocals. Outside of that record, Marshall has seen fit to return to the band's roots as an instrumental powerhouse, even as other original members peeled off from the project. Aaron himself is highly regarded amongst the YouTube guitar music community, having interviewed with Rick Beato and given rig rundowns, with praise lavished at his approachability, vast knowledge of gear and theory, and extremely friendly demeanour.    His personal positivity extends to many of the tracks here, with the upbeat triumph of single ""5HTP"" and ""Vantablack"". Much of the record trades in similar sounds, with Fang Island-esque guitar leads squealing their way over palm-muted rhythms that often veer into djent territory. Occasionally, filters are applied to guitar riffs to give the feeling of an EDM song about to crescendo into a drop.    The production is dry, and serves to make the individual parts of each track easily dissectible, even to the detriment of the mood of the song. Atonal sections don't have the mix to augment their eerie feel, while those triumphant heavy riffs don't include enough low end to fill out their larger-than-life, ""rush-into-battle"" moments. The guitars alternate between mid-range surgical tones and incredibly brittle ""build-up"" timbres, again reminiscent of EDM's woozy crescendos. Quieter, clean passages like the opening of ""Luna[r]tic"" find Aaron Marshall at his most melodic and sonically interesting, but these are uncommon moments.    Intervals has toured with prog metal giants Between the Buried and Me, as well as Protest the Hero — bands of relatively like-minded musicians, who have mixed their technical instrumental prowess with songs and narratives that feel just as massive, winding and unpredictable as the playing. Aaron Marshall's songwriting here often doesn't bring the heft that his influences do, but his playing is unmatched in virtuosity.    This is music meant to inspire, and Marshall intends it as such. However, the unending assault of nitro-fuelled guitar runs and booming djent sections don't leave enough room to reflect on any of the more gorgeous melodies that blister on by.

2020-11-30,Brock Thiessen,8,"SOUNDTRACKS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",John Carpenter's 'Escape from New York' Sounds More Classic Now Than Ever,,"At this point,  John Carpenter  is known as much for his music as his films, and for good reason. With the director almost always handling the music to his films himself, Carpenter has pulled together a stunning string of soundtracks over the years. And riding high among those OST classics is 1981's  Escape from New York , which is once again ready to kick your ass out of the world with a new reissue by  Waxwork Records .    While  Escape from New York  has received more than a few reissues over the years, this double-vinyl set from Waxwork promises to present the ""complete score album"" by Carpenter and longtime scoring partner  Alan Howarth . What that amounts to is four sides of 180-gram vinyl, a jump from the original's 13 tracks to a whopping 28, and one of the best  Escape from New York  presentations yet.    While Carpenter's  Halloween  will forever stand as his most memorable theme,  Escape from New York  is arguably his strongest and most versatile soundtrack effort, introducing us to the synth-driven minimalism that would go on to define the classic John Carpenter sound. From the sky-scraping ""Main Theme"" to the beautifully fragile ""Across the Roof"" to the musclebound, disco-tinted ""The Duke Arrives/Barricade,"" the music of  Escape from New York  sounds as modern and future-thinking in 2020 as it must have in 1981.    Amazingly, this all came from an incredibly primitive musical setup, with Howarth and Carpenter employing a range of now-classic gear. This included ARP and Prophet-5 synthesizers and the legendary Linn LM-1 drum machine, which were then given sonic highlights with more traditional instruments like acoustic piano and Fender guitar. Yet through this no-frills set-up, the pair managed to create one of their most timeless and influential works, leaving countless artists doing their damnedest to duplicate this sound ever since.      But for the JC fans who know all this already, is Waxwork's  Escape from New York  worth a double-dip? For those with only a truncated early 2000s reissue, most definitely. But for everyone who has an already expanded reissue from more recent years, the listening experience is a very similar one. That said, the sound quality of the Waxwork release is phenomenal, with the ""Statue of Liberty"" blue green marble edition sounding not only dead quiet but dynamic in the best way possible. In other words, if you don't already own an IRL copy of the album, this is the one to get.    And for those who have yet to dive into the world on John Carpenter,  Escape from New York  remains the perfect entry point — both on film and on record — and still sounds as timeless as ever all these decades later.

Cooper',,"Mainly comprised of original songs and recorded live off the floor,  D.B. Cooper  is a satisfying exploration of the bluegrass genre by the promising Canadian band,  Chopped Liver . The Hamilton-based trio is comprised of Andrew Ivens on guitar, Adam Vrankulj on double bass and Victor Vrankulj on banjo.     The album's strength is undeniably its original content. Tracks like ""Strike"" and ""Down to The Hollow"" offer thoughtful lyrics and interesting chord progressions. The album is more introspective — and even political — than most bluegrass, and as such, occupies a middle ground between traditional bluegrass and acoustic folk.    The vocals on  D.B. Cooper  take a backseat to the instruments. While this choice does showcase some moments of truly excellent playing, it also detracts from the harmonies. This is particularly evident in the opening track, ""I Know You Rider,"" which many will inevitably compare to the iconic high-energy version by Seldom Scene. Perhaps if there was a mandolin or fiddle to cut through the mix, or if there were stronger harmonies throughout, the album's overall feel wouldn't be quite so subdued.  D.B. Cooper  has some kinks — most self-produced projects do — but that's part of its humble charm.

2020-11-16,Bryon Hayes,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Liturgy Fulfil Their Grand Vision on 'Origin of the Alimonies',,"Hunter Hunt-Hendrix threads a complex mythology and an almost religious temperament through her work as  Liturgy . She calls her unique worldview Perichoresis, which also happens to be a term used in theology to describe the relationship between the three aspects of the Christian notion of God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Hunt-Hendrix's version explores this idea with a more artistic sensibility, describing the relationship between music, narrative and philosophy.    This intricate nexus of ideas has achieved its zenith with  Origin of the Alimonies , Liturgy's fifth LP and second to be released on Hunt-Hendrix's own  YLYLCYN  label. The album is a Wagnerian fever dream that weaves a cosmological origin story, in which a pair of divine beings are separated, rending the fabric of existence. Through this split, the universe is formed as the Four Alimonies, ""irreducible layers of reality.""    Hunt-Hendrix is joined by long-time collaborator Bernard Gann on guitar, plus Tia Vincent-Clark on bass and drummer Leo Didkovsky. This quartet forms the core Liturgy lineup for  Origin , which has been augmented by eight additional musicians wielding instruments more commonly associated with classical music. This 12-piece mini-orchestra have expertly realized Hunt-Hendrix's grand vision, which she both composed and arranged.     Origin of the Alimonies  is an opera, complete with three acts, an overture and an interlude. Sonically, it picks up on past Liturgy motifs: minimalism, black metal, classical music and electronic beats. The scope and scale, however, is incredibly vast. Hunt-Hendrix hand-picked the eight additional musicians from among the American avant-garde scene, and each of these players adds depth to the already experimental compositions; they truly shine when given breathing room outside of the seemingly limitless crescendos that are both intensely satisfying and incredibly overwhelming.    The quieter moments on  Origin  are far from delicate. This is a story of pain, transformation, redemption and love. Such powerful themes lend themselves to oblique sensibilities and the cathartic wrenching of sound from instruments, and Liturgy have certainly conjured up a piece of music that is on par with the ambitions of the lore.

If sophomore release  Reluctant Hero  receives the same treatment, it's unfair, since this is much better.    The past six years have been kind to this foursome's chemistry. Opener ""Deconstructing Self-Destruction"" gives each member room to flex, with better riffs and arrangements than anything on the debut. Still, the band lend gravitate towards hookiness more than extremity, made more obvious with ""Dream Gone Bad."" There's a  Chaos A.D. -style breakdown here and a math-y switch up there, but melodies usually prevail over confrontation.    KBK highlight Puciato as one of modern music's most gifted vocalists. Sanders and Cavalera largely stick to their guns, but it's anyone's guess where Puciato will go next during cuts like ""Left of Center."" His high-reaching melodies work wonders amid that song's dazzling guitar lines, while his feral scream coincides with the punk adrenaline of ""Filthy Vagabond."" From  Misfits -style ""woah"" vocals to a chaotic guitar solo, the collective guns throttle without stepping on each other's toes.    Koller's drumming packs tact and nuance into an accessible framework, like the tom flams and double-time fills he works into the slow-burning ""Inner Calm from Outer Storms."" Sanders and Puciat trade some moody verses before Cavalera's signature growl completes the bridge's thrashing two-step. The song's mid-tempo structure carries over to ""From a Crowded Wound"" and ""The Great Purge,"" offering increased heaviness and more freedom to jam over the infectious motifs.    Still, these songs aren't about to win over the underground. Only the one-minute assault of ""Animus"" could satisfy those who wish  Sepultura  still sounded like  Beneath the Remains , but honestly, it takes a very closed mind to write off  Reluctant Hero .    Deep cuts like ""Comfort from Nothing"" and ""Dead Limbs"" offer some of KBK's most interesting songwriting to date. Both succeed in their dynamic, expressionist explorations, but those detours give way to unpredictable transitions, punishing riffs and bludgeoning breakdowns. Yes, the closing ballad title track isn't as heavy as Sepultura, as progressive as Mastodon or as chaotic as Converge or Dillinger, but it's a compelling display of these four elevating poppy ideas with explosive, multilayered musicality and hard-hitting emotion.    Though it's not pushing boundaries,  Reluctant Hero  proves metal can be catchy without being stupid. If melodic groove metal needs a hero in 2020, it's Killer Be Killed.

It's a culture collision that allows for a unique musical narrative pulled from various experiences and sounds.     Konke  continues where the group's last release,  Thina , left off. Opener ""Our People,"" featuring producer and beatmaker  Quelle Chris , is soulful alt-hip-hop that sounds fresh while feeling entirely familiar. Lo-fi haze, bouncy synth and a lazy beat fuel the instrumental ""Cloud,"" with a crispness replacing the crackle as it bleeds nicely into ""You Better.""

The album opens with arguably the best Fuck the Facts song of all time in ""Doubt, Fear, Neglect"" — a song with some of the heaviest riffs ever made by the band, balanced with melodic death metal passages throughout. For every blast beat offered on tracks like ""Ailluers"" and ""Sans Lumiere,"" there are equally morose and plodding riffs in songs like ""Aube"" and ""Everything I Love Is Ending."" The whole album balances itself out in a way that keeps the listener from settling into predictable patterns of heavy music.

2020-11-17,Adam Feibel,6,"MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS","Bearings Enter the Pop-Punk Big Leagues with 'Hello, It's You'",,"Bearings ' first record,  Blue in the Dark , has to rank among the better debuts in the recent history of pop-punk. By 2018, they had spent enough time slogging away in basements and studying the songwriting and style of their forebears to be able to make a big splash. Bringing to mind groups like Transit, Moose Blood and a little bit of Jimmy Eat World, this Ottawa band emerged onto the scene fully formed and eager to surprise.    With their sophomore effort, Bearings have set out to prove they can hang with the hottest names in modern pop-punk — and they're shooting even higher. Produced by Courtney Ballard (Good Charlotte, Super Whatevr, Emarosa),  Hello, It's You finds  the Ottawa band making a significant leap from underdog ambition to big-league pop fantasies.    Bearings are still playing and recording with the confidence of a band that has been doing this for many years.  Hello, It's You  is loaded up with punchy choruses and catchy hooks — just try listening to ""Sway"" once and see if you don't have it stuck in your head for the rest of the day.    The thing is, this album isn't so sure what exactly it wants to be. ""Better Yesterday"" and ""Sway"" phenomenally recapture the feeling of the 2000s — an era of Canadian pop culture that brought us Simple Plan and  Degrassi: The Next Generation . The made-for-arenas ""Super Deluxe"" and ""So Damn Wrong"" feel like a logical result of the 1975's invasion of the Spotify playlists of rock musicians. ""Lovely Lovely"" is a sunny, honey-coated tune that Patrick Monahan would be happy to sing. ""Over Now"" and ""I Feel It All"" tap into the pop-minded alt-rock of contemporaries like Trophy Eyes, Boston Manor and Seaway. It's these later songs, along with the heavy-hitting closer ""Transient Colours,"" where Bearings feel most at home. Conversely, they fall prey to the pervasiveness of Soundcloud rap on ""Dreams,"" sounding like a Post Malone tune sung by Jordan Pundik in what sticks out as the album's only clear-cut misfire.    There's no inherent reason this band can't bring all these sounds together under the Bearings banner, but they'd be better off tailoring the material to fit the group perfectly rather than trying on several different outfits in the mirror.  Blue in the Dark  was smaller in scope, but its successes came from being musically sure-footed and lyrically purposeful.  Hello, It's You  goes for something newer and bigger, yet it falls into familiar traps.  ( Pure Noise )                           MUSIC   POP AND ROCK   ALBUM   REVIEWS              More Bearings",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/bearings_hello_its_you_album_review

If those projects are where Monks channels his serious songwriting and commercial aspirations, his work with  bandcalledmax  — originally known as MAX, but presumably renamed due to the  incredibly famous pop star of the same name  — comes across as a bit of lark. Judging by the sound of debut album  Turn It Up , this is where Monks goes to blow off steam.     Turn It Up  is a sock-hoppin' romp, with boogie-woogie electric guitars set to a frantic punk rhythm section. From the instrumental 12-bar blooze of the opening ""Theme"" (which comes complete with a skronking horn solo) to the fuzzed-out bubblegum of the Ramones-indebted ""I'm Gonna See My Baby Tonight,"" bandcalledmax keep their songs simple and satisfying. They're having fun with retro rock conventions rather than trying to subvert them. On the chorus of closer ""Rocker,"" Monks comes right out and says it: ""I'm a rocker / I'm a rock'n'roller.""    The three-piece switch things up on ""Tangerine,"" with its nylon-string bossanova, 8-bit drum programming, and quirky lyrics that offer commentary on armchair activism (""You know I protest the best / For all the nation's oppressed / Who made the shirt on my back / Who put the screws in my Mac"") alongside delightful nonsense (""All of the people unite / And vote for Pepsi or Sprite / I'm on the winning team / Tangerine""). bandcalledmax similarly slow things down for the 6/8 blues ballad ""Fool"" and the hornt-up serenade ""Wild Horses"" (featuring pleas of ""I wanna go all the way with you"").

In its entirety,  Self Help  is a breath of fresh air. This album isn't just casual background music; each song drifts off into a different direction, exhibiting a distinctive and unique tone. The album emerges with feel-good, upbeat tracks and gradually slows down into a soothing, laid-back place.    ""Sing a Silent Gospel"" and ""Just Space for Light"" feature guest vocals (Meg Remy of U.S. Girls and Dorothea Paas on the former, Jennifer Castle on the latter). While not overpowering, there is a clear difference in the atmosphere — a form of self-expression or freedom, almost as if a door has been opened. Being able to find a free-flowing format like this is a momentous achievement.     One of the most unique moments on the album is ""Cloud"" — the expression of the sounds flowing through the sky. The track is simple and, in a subtle way, a very powerful experience that grants a chance at clarity.    ""Birds Fly Through Ancient Ruins"" has beautifully woven elements of Eastern psychedelic expression. Throughout the entire piece, the listener's ear follows a variety of different parts. Whether you're listening with intent or giving your mind a break, your subconscious will begin to follow the pattern you most connect with.    Concluding with a classical piece ""Extinct Commune,""  Self Help  comes full circle with unity and cohesion. Although the music was written just prior to the pandemic outbreak, it really speaks to those who might be seeking a break from reality.

After a sojourn in Brooklyn, where he shared stages and studios with a who's who of the New York jazz scene, and aside from a stint playing with Rwandan musician Mighty Popo, Cancura has used his return to Canada to run the gamut of roots music, including a series of folk LPs and performances with singer-songwriters like Kathleen Edwards and Jeremy Fisher.

A truly collaborative effort, this LP showcases each musician wonderfully.

Legalization, it seems, has been good to members Josée Caron and Lucy Niles, whose travails have moved beyond being stoned in public to bigger concerns, like the power of rock'n'roll. They double down on the rock tropes, rewriting the genre's founding mythologies through their unique tongue-in-cheek lens. A guitar that gives its player mythical musical powers? You can find that on ""Honey."" Rock's ability to bring people together? That's on ""Rock is My Rock."" Rock's ability to make people really horny? See ""Big Gay Hands.""    But  Never Give Up  also expands their riff-centric template. ""The Pit,"" ""Good Place to Hide (At the Time)"" and the Jim Steinman-esque ""Roller Coaster (Life Is One)"" grapple with mid-20s malaise over soaring instrumentation far more sublime than the rest of the album's riff-o-rammas; they're some of the record's most satisfying listens and offer a look at where a third Partner record might lead.    At times, Caron and Niles' ambitions run up against technological and financial hurdles. The band's production on  Never Give Up  is impressive. The guitars and drums, in particular, sound huge, and there are plenty of little flourishes fleshing out the spaces in these songs. In places, the vocals can feel a bit tossed off, the band's DIY aesthetic brushing up against their big-budget inspiration.    Overall, this is another triumph for the band. Where their debut found the pair pulling humour out of life's little indignities, here they show how to triumph over them (usually by rocking, better, harder, faster and more often). Far from being a one-note act,  Never Give Up  proves that Partner are a band with endless musical possibilities before them.

The band's artistic peaks, 2009's  Bitte Orca  and 2012's  Swing Lo Magellan , were in no small part due to bassist/vocalist Angel Deradoorian and guitarist/vocalist Amber Coffman.    Without either of their contributions, Longstreth's latest records have felt somewhat empty, despite being more personal than ever.  5EPs , the 20-song collection that combines the band's 2020 releases, does something to correct this imbalance. Featuring vocals and instrumentation from three new members — Maia Friedman, Felicia Douglass and Kristin Slipp — this new music feels warm and grounded again.    Each four-song EP can be boiled down to a basic defining feature — Friedman-led  Windows Open  is jaunty and mainly acoustic, Douglass-led  Flight Tower  is synthetic, Slipp-led  Earth Crisis  is orchestral, Longstreth-led  Super João  is soft and acoustic, and closer  Ring Road  is a slightly broader, full-band experience, taking small elements of everything that preceded.     5EPs  is more restrained and serious than Dirty Projectors'  Lamp Lit Prose , but their influence is palpable.  Flight Tower 's R&B rhythms wouldn't make sense without songs like 2017's Dawn Richard-assisted ""Cool Your Heart,"" though nothing here is quite as fun as ""Cool Your Heart"" — or as goofy as something like ""Break Thru.""    This is some of the most straight-forward music that Dirty Projectors have ever made; some songs — particularly the gentler moments on  Windows Open  and  Super João  — could be described as simple. Even the Björk-esque, latex-warped orchestras of  Earth Crisis  are clean and streamlined — small nocturnal loops rather than overblown epics.    In allowing others back into the fray and stripping their sound, Longstreth has once again tapped into what made the band so engrossing in the first place.  5EPs  feels like a restart, a long and considered exhale.

The album opens with ""The Bitter End,"" a sultry track that addresses the paradoxes of love: ""Sometimes I wish that my heart / could fly away from you,"" an electro-robotic soundscape contrasted with Kazi's uber-romantic vocal. ""End of This World Together"" explores a less-is-more palette, electronic beats and synth-y chords complementing Kazi's sensual voice.     The title song is the highpoint of the project. Kazi's intro, effected to conjure a heartbroken automaton, brings to mind the resonant voice of Anohni, particularly 2016's  Hopelessness . Kazi's treated voice is well juxtaposed with an additional and cleaner vocal that emerges from Murray's wash of synths and dramatic instrumental accents.    ""No Excuses"" explores the intersection of electronica, dream pop and R&B, Kazi's melody emerging from a tremulous soundscape. ""Free and Broken"" features a welter of tumultuous sonics, with Kazi reflecting wistfully on the early days of a relationship: ""Oh I miss the ways / that we were free and broken.""     The album closes with ode of gratitude ""Who You Are"": ""With you, I can do anything / with you, I can be anyone / with me, you can be who you want."" The song is one part a  déclaration d'amour  and one part a positive reframing of the stasis that often accompanies long-term commitment.     Meteors Could Come Down  is a mercurially transportive project, the signature downtempo and ambient elements of LAL's earlier recordings less pronouncedly articulated, the album's melodies occurring as more spontaneously crafted and possibly scat-inspired. With  Meteors Could Come Down , LAL revel in minimalism, finding fresh ways to blend the  au naturel  qualities of Kazi's voice and Murray's posthumanist soundscapes.

2020-11-09,Alex Hudson,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Outer Rooms Offer a Poignant Glimpse of Toronto's Gentrification on 'All Will Be Well & All Will Be Well, etc., etc.'",,"Anyone who has lived in Toronto for longer than a couple of years has probably felt the sting of gentrification: skyrocketing rents, shiny glass condos by the lake, beloved local hotspots forced out by developers.     Outer Rooms  know the sense of betrayal that comes from watching the city you live in become increasingly unliveable — the feeling of loving a place that doesn't love you back. On third album  All Will Be Well & All Will Be Well, etc., etc. , the Toronto trio set their sights on a changing city, pepping lyrics with hyper-local references and universal lamentations about feeling like an outsider in your own neighbourhood. ""All day Toronto is growing into glare / Climbing up toward the cranes in the air / The city's building something / Extending beyond our reach,"" frontman Andrew Fitzpatrick howls during the devastating climax of opener ""Thunder East.""    With songs that namecheck the Don Valley Parkway, Castle Frank subway station and the Ford brothers, there's no mistaking Outer Rooms' Toronto pedigree. That extends to the arrangements, which channel bands like Broken Social Scene and Great Bloomers (hey, remember them?) with group shouts, echoing post-rock ambience and spiky indie rock crescendos. Throw in some fidgety post-punk sing-speak (the second half of ""Step Twice"") and a couple of slow-burning drum machine ballads (""All Will Be Well,"" ""Station""), and  All Will Be Well  sounds like a perfect update on circa-2010 indie rock. It's the kind of easily digestible pop-rock sound that goes down easy and acts as the perfect vehicle for the band's bittersweet pathos and eloquent, inquisitive lyrics.    Outer Rooms stretch their wings with a trilogy of numbered songs in the album's back half, as they turn their focus away from gentrification and instead ruminate on memories on death and childhood loss. But even here, it's the minute details that hit hardest, rather than the reflections on mortality — an anecdote about ""the Blockbuster down the street"" is the lasting takeaway from ""Kids of Good (I)""; in ""Backyard Ghosts (III),"" it's an offhand ""Hey, Fred, hey, what the fuck?""    It's not that Outer Rooms are saying anything particularly unique; their experiences of TTC commutes and getting forced out of dilapidated apartments are depressingly relatable and almost mundane in their frankness. For Toronto dwellers — or anyone from a big, rapidly developing city — these lyrics almost feel like small talk. And that's what makes  All Will Be Well  so comforting, as it resembles the cathartic experience of complaining about the home you fantasize about leaving but probably never will.

2020-11-10,Daniel Sylvester,7,"MUSIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK",AC/DC Are Back to Their Former Glory on 'POWER UP',,"In 2017, it looked like  AC/DC , a band synonymous with resilience, was far too fractured and vulnerable to carry on. Within a two year span, drummer  Phil Rudd was arrested for procuring a murder  (and later  pleaded guilty to threatening to kill and drug possession ), vocalist  Brian Johnson was forced to stop touring due to hearing issues , rhythm guitarist and founding member  Malcolm Young passed away due to dementia  and bassist  Cliff Williams quit the band , leaving only Angus Young behind to pick up the pieces; the lead guitarist decided to use the same tragedy that split the band apart to help rebuild it, pulling together parts of songs written with his brother to  get the whole gang back together  and craft new music around it.    The resulting LP,  POWER UP  (also known as  PWR/UP ), finds the classic quartet (along with Stevie Young, who replaced his uncle in 2016) ripping through a joyful 12-track power cycle that finds AC/DC as energized as they've sounded in decades.    Recorded at Warehouse Studio in Vancouver with  Pearl Jam  and  Bruce Springsteen  producer, Brendan O'Brien, the 41-minute album has the band deep within a familiar groove. On tracks like the Muscle Shoals-inspired ""Through the Mists of Time"" and the extremely catchy rocker ""Witch's Spell,"" Johnson sounds absolutely spellbound, delivering a soulful and mighty howl. On the silky single ""Shot in the Dark"" and the anthemic rocker ""Kick You When You're Down,"" the Youngs come off impossibly tight, while ""Demon Fire"" and ""Wild Reputation"" see the band going off-script a bit with growled spoken word pieces courtesy of Johnson, while O'Brien keeps a high level of grit and grind to the entire recording.    While the album understandably contains some filler within its bottom third,  POWER UP  nonetheless falls securely within AC/DC's great B-level albums; just as solid and memorable as  Let There Be Rock  or  For Those About to Rock (We Salute You) .    The fact that AC/DC came together to create something as satisfying as  POWER UP  when the cards were down is a complete miracle upon itself, and AC/DC seem more than ready to celebrate.

2020-11-11,Sydney Brasil,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK",Falcon Jane Draws Us into Her Universe on 'Faith',,"It's invigorating to see  Falcon Jane  continue on an upward trajectory. After cementing her self-described plez-rock on 2018's  Feelin' Freaky ,  Faith  not only retains that same charm, but brings in more depth. Written after a series of deaths in her family, project leader Sarah May's emotional honesty adds to the distinctiveness to her voice as a whole. These are songs undoubtedly written as a means to work out her own feelings, and they contain so much warmth that her optimistic storytelling perseveres.    May's words run as deep as the atmospheric surroundings of her instruments, as these are songs that create environments from front to back. ""Feelings"" has the aura of a semi-formal dance scene in a high school teen drama, while ""The Other Moon"" appropriately sounds like it's being played into the ether. Both of these songs also showcase what the rest of  Faith  sets out to do: the twang of the guitars is a product of country influence, filled with much of that classic compressed tone. However, there's a little bit of chorus sprinkled in here and there that meshes with the airiness of everything else. Overall, these are extremely confident guitar lines that know their place perfectly.    Though the guitars are what give the record its edge, there's something ethereal about the juxtaposition of these tones against the dreamy, heavy synths. It's these synths that throw you deeply into Falcon Jane's universe right from the start of the album on ""All of a Sudden."" It's near impossible to not get sucked in right away, since  Faith  draws you in so welcomingly. May's faith in her feelings is responsible for much of the album's greatness, making it better the more you listen to it.

2020-11-11,Sarah Chodos,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC,POP AND ROCK",The Darcys Reinvent Themselves Once Again to Navigate 'Fear & Loneliness',,"The Darcys ' Wes Marskell says that he and collaborator Jason Couse were aiming to ""blur the line between fact and fiction"" and to create a character that is a hybrid of themselves who ""bought the dream and lived to tell the story."" Their latest work,  Fear & Loneliness , is a walk through a dream with the weight of reality thumping against the ground.    The Darcys are ever-evolving, but their earlier work has had an artsy leaning, including a  moody reinterpretation of Steely Dan's  Aja   that some said better conveyed the lyrics than the original. Later, they would take a trek into funkier terrain with 2016's  Centrefold .    A move from Toronto to Los Angeles has turned the Darcys in yet a new direction.  Fear & Loneliness ' opening title track begins with the sound of classic Hollywood instrumentals and the lyrics follow in a slow, somber swoon. However, the band's funk perseveres.    Above all, the Darcys maintain their tendency to reimagine, to get to the heart of the matter and to explore how music can convey what words can't. Dream and disillusionment are not opposites — they are different sides of the coin of vulnerability; this notion is brought to mind on the funky ""Boys Don't."" In keeping with this theme, ""Look Me in the Eyes"" is an up-tempo song about facing hard truths.    The mood is shaken again as the beautiful, shapeshifting instrumental funhouse of ""Reservoir No. 4"" leads us into ""Cowboy Movies,"" where a gritty guitar can be made out, snaking through the mood music against the lyrics ""I'll be your Marlboro Man,"" and finishes with ""Glory Days,"" which sounds fit for an intimate bar setting.    The funk thumps through the Western and old Hollywood panache — the layer of dreams and pretensions and disillusionment and vulnerability puff up in smoke, but the storyteller walks on to a steady electronic beat.

2020-11-11,Manus Hopkins,8,"REVIEWS,METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,MUSIC",Toronto's Völur Transcend the Boundaries of Metal on 'Death Cult',,"The saying ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" can be applied to a lot of metal music. There are bands who have built entire 30-plus year careers off of hashing out the same music again and again, and legions of fans who haven't had any problem with it. There's even scenes and sub-genres whose groups have all had similar musical tendencies, aesthetics and even lyrical content.    Every now and again, however, a band comes along that is like absolutely nobody else. One such band transcending the boundaries of metal and taking the genre in strange new directions is Toronto's  Völur . On their third album  Death Cult , the avant-garde doom trio seem to have found their footing and developed their sound, resulting in a truly unique and utterly immersive listening experience. It may be difficult to imagine heavy metal without guitars — but with only bass, drums and violin, Völur not only make it work, but also create music that would be criminal to label as merely one style. Among the heavy doom stomps and sinister growled vocals, there are elements of jazz, folk, classical and even opera.    Sitting at only four tracks long,  Death Cult  may look like a short album, or even an EP, but make no mistake — with a nearly 40-minute runtime, this is unquestionably a full album. Once it reaches the end, it does feel like it could have been longer, but only because of how enjoyable a listen it is; the record could be double the length it is and still not grow stale. In fact, each individual track feels like its own journey — particularly the immensely climactic 11-minute-long ""Freyjan Death Cult.""    The best part about what Völur has done with  Death Cult   is its ability to challenge what the metal umbrella can encompass. This is an album that will undoubtedly be loved by doom fans, but it has enough versatility to fit within the tastes of many non-metal listeners as well.

2020-11-12,Sarah Jessica Rintjema ,7,"POP AND ROCK,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Good Kid Bring Listeners Back to a World of Chuck Taylors and Side-Swipe Bands on Second EP,,"Good Kid 2  is quite possibly the most literal title  these Toronto pop-punkers  could've chosen. The second EP is also the longest in the band's catalogue — and the fresh-faced smiling mascot of 2018's  Good Kid  returns to the album cover, once again projecting expectations of sunny bubble-gum soft rock only to be smacked by lyrics of self-conflict, bitterness, loneliness and heartbreak.    Upbeat, sugary sweet and with improved production,  Good Kid 2 's sound sends you travelling back to a time rife with Chuck Taylors and side-swept bangs. Tracks ""Drifting"" and ""Everything Everything"" sound like backlogged  Panic! At The Disco  songs, where sunshine-filled guitars and heavy drums are paired alongside stories of disillusionment. ""It was a city of faith / From the year it was made / But then it started to decay / But I'm still here, amongst everything, everything.""    ""Pox"" is a particularly vulnerable moment on the project: ""I wish I had been born at sea / Then you wouldn't care, and you wouldn't know me."" It is easily the softest track on the album, with hushed vocals, ghostly oohs and a slowed, sad take on their normally glittering guitar work. Good Kid then jump right back into loud, bright instrumentation on the following track, ""Aloe Lite,"" applying a bit of soothing optimism to an otherwise melancholy vibe.     Good Kid 2  is heftier, louder and has an overall higher production value than the previous work on  Good Kid , but sticks to the same box of tricks. The album opens with the line, ""Well, here we are again"" — and while the band's sound is nothing short of great, you might leave the project wishing the rockers pulled out something new.    Then again, for long-term fans, classic pop-punk lovers, and those feeling disenchanted by the state of the world,  Good Kid 2  is an album to get excited about.

2020-11-12,Scott Roos,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC,ALBUM",Yukon Blonde Take an Experimental Pop Turn on 'Vindicator',,"Vindicator , the fifth outing from Vancouver based  Yukon Blonde , is an 11-song onslaught of pop psychedelia, chock-full of keyboard acrobatics and dance beats. It's the first record that has seen the ensemble write, record and produce entirely on their own — and their autonomy shows in the experimental vibe found throughout.    Kicking off with the chill, hook-laden jams of ""It's What You Are,""  Vindicator  grooves from start to finish, with singer-guitarist  Jeff Innes  often splitting vocal duties with keyboardist Rebecca Gray. ""YGTT,"" another highlight track, with funky bass lines laid down by  James Younger , sounds something akin to if Canadian soul hero Remy Shand were to front British trip-hop legends Massive Attack.    Keyboard theatrics and pop studio trickery aside, the record shines best with a less-is-more approach, where the band's focus is straight-ahead and song-centric; this is evidenced on tracks like ""Your Heart's My Home,"" ""Get Precious"" and ""Big Black Cloud.""    On  Vindicator , Yukon Blonde are an outfit that continue to evolve and experiment with their overall sonic palette, even though they has a tendency to be a little overzealous. When the keyboard pyrotechnics are on point, they add beauty and definition, but when they are too far to the front of the mix, they can overshadow the brilliance of the songwriting lying just below the surface.    In an age of boring, watered down, corporate, vanilla, focus-group engineered pop-rock shenanigans, it's cool to hear a group like Yukon Blonde still taking educated risks and maintaining the same punk DIY credos that put them on the Canadian musical map in the first place.

2020-11-12,Kyle Kohner,8,"POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS",Told Slant Embraces the Perils of Intimacy on 'Point the Flashlight and Walk',,"For Brooklyn singer-songwriter, Felix Walworth, a.k.a. Told Slant, the gravity of devotion is a risk that has never weighed heavier. So heavy, in fact, they've stripped their sound down to express this weight in its purest form. Spoken through ambient plucks of guitar, harp, and the timorous quality of Walsworth's voice, their first record in four years,  Point the Flashlight and Walk , sees Told Slant removing all barriers to embark upon the risky journey of devotion — the ups-and-downs of self-sacrifice for another.    ""I want to see the world without me,"" Walworth sings on the penultimate track ""From the Roofbeams,"" their newly intimate sound touched with vibrant hues of folk and emo. Revolving around the question of ""How much can you lose and still be you,"" Walworth takes a fly-on-the-wall perspective of their own nervous attempts at giving themself up in the name of love.    But as the lovestruck multi-instrumentalist lets their guard down, anxiety emerges — sometimes in the form of sudden rushes of guitar strums, and sometimes through the hushed whispers of Walsworth's vocals. Singing ""Gotta take a pill just to meet you in the city, if it's too heavy, will you carry it with me"" on the opener ""Meet You in the City,"" Told Slant expresses trepidation over meeting the one they adore. A hesitant act of vulnerability, yes, but one that becomes more raw and devout as the record evolves.    Elsewhere, Walworth's devotion goes unreciprocated, lamenting on ""Run Around The School,"" ""Caring for you, so I don't have to care for myself / Living is hard when you don't want me to."" But as the Brooklyn artist continues to put themself last for the sake of someone else, they miraculously become clear as day. Their penchant for delicate guitar textures and storytelling are so emotionally striking, their forlorn heart ultimately shines through. Even when the singer's fragile voice is in danger of buckling under the immense weight of unrequited love, their guitar-plucking virtuosity and poetic intimacy hold steady.    Whether it's two empty things exchanging emptiness on the rhythmic ""Flashlight On,"" or two hands caressing each other during the mournful ""Fog on the Glass,"" Told Slant ensures no moment is without a private, tear-shedding turn of phrase or image.    Walsworth sings on ""From the Roofbeams,"" with a beautifully unpolished tremble, ""I'll stay with you...even when it's scary to."" Listeners are encouraged to take that same risk and wear their hearts on their sleeves, taking the risk of devotion no matter how daunting it seems.

2020-11-13,Kaelen Bell,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",'Encounter' Shows Beyries' Hunger for Discovery ,,"If you want a masterclass in building a song that simmers without stagnating, ""What We Have"" is a good place to start. The opening track on Amélie  Beyries ' new record is lush and dewy but never gaudy — a slowly cresting wave of sound that builds gently without crashing. Every strum and sigh, every wiggling bass tone and plunk of keys, and every pulsing beat is placed just so. It's a subtle and dazzling way to introduce a record, easing the listener into Beyries' world.    The album that follows never quite lives up to the small majesty of its opening track. While beautifully rendered, some of the bigger songs feel swamped by their busy arrangements, with most attempting a rousing payoff through layers of piano, percussion, choirs, strings and production flourishes. The density of the songs might not be noticed otherwise, but knowing what Beyries can do with a more delicate sound — see ""What We Have,"" the gentle build of ""Closely,"" or French ballad ""Nous Somme"" — they start to feel a bit overburdened.    Sometimes she strikes a balance between her two modes, as on the starry, crushed velvet lounge of ""Into You."" It allows Beyrie's smooth-stone voice to explore its smokier depths in an arrangement that feels deservedly sumptuous, though the string section almost dominates the song's tender sensuality. Another highlight, the chugging ""The Story of Eva,"" is proof of Beyries' dynamic range with near-grunge guitars and a distant chorus vocal sending her sound plummeting to its heaviest point.    While sometimes falling just shy of baroque-pop splendour,  Encounte r is an ambitious record, full of passion and a meticulous attention to detail and structure. It risks overwhelming at times but, crucially, never feels dull or lazy — a record made with great care and a hunger for discovery.

2020-11-16,Luke Pearson,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM","Over a Decade Since Their Last Collab, Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas Are as Compatible as Ever on 'III'",,"Norway's leading post-techno explorers,   Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas  have reunited again, following up 2009's  II  with the unsurprisingly titled  III . Their latest collaboration finds them in fine form, blending a rich array of styles into a complex but natural-sounding mix that always feels effortlessly conjured. It demands some patience, perhaps, eschewing bold gestures in favour of a more restrained ebb and flow, but close attention reveals a rewarding galaxy of granular detail and subtle shifts.    Space metaphors are apt here, as the most prevalent vibe of  III  is cosmic — an aesthetic with roots reaching back as far as German kosmische. The twist here is the very French-sounding disco-funk undercurrent that carries it all along, often recalling a more open-ended  Air , or some of the more pensive moods on  Daft Punk 's  Random Access Memories .    The album opens gently with the cheeky ""Grand Finale"" — a hazy dusk of a track, jewelled with a tinkling piano lead so fragile it seems almost wrong to turn up too loud, before upping the tempo for the tasteful grooving of ""Martin 5000"" — the kind of immaculate but fairly standard toe tapper the duo have been putting out for years. It's in the album's quietly psychedelic centre that things get really special — the intricate arpeggios sparkling in the background of ""Small Stream,"" the analogue chirping in ""Oranges"" that sounds like two friendly comets in conversation; they're small details, but this is an album about exactly that.    Those who prefer the more straightforward and rousing fare the two have released outside this project should be advised that  III  is definitely more ethereal drift than shooting star. Longtime fans will know what to expect, however, and while it's more of the same perhaps, it's arguably the best iteration yet.

2020-10-29,Ian Gormely,6,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS",Salem Don't Get with the Times on Comeback Album 'Fires in Heaven',,"Between 2008 and 2011,  Salem  burned bright. During these three years, the Michigan-based trio released a handful of EPs and their lone album, 2010's  King Night .  Their stay in the spotlight was short but sweet, eliciting strong reactions from pretty much everyone who came in contact with their music, before the group seemingly disappearing into a nihilistic haze.    Salem's legacy has lived on well past any sell-by date that was once ascribed to them. From the industrial paranoia of  Kanye West 's  Yeezus  (Jack Donoghue co-produced  ""Black Skinhead "") to  Billie Eilish 's goth-pop aesthetic, Salem and the 'witch house' microgenre they helped birth have proven far more culturally resilient than anyone could have predicted.    Just as that influence appears to be cresting, Jack Donoghue and John Holland have re-emerged (Heather Marlatt was  contentiously ""force[d] out"" of the group ), bringing with them a decade-in-the-making follow-up to their debut.  Fires in Heaven  sounds like it could have been produced in 2011, exemplifying how far out of step with the mainstream Salem were in their heyday and how far the mainstream has shifted in their direction in the interim.    That shift is a double-edged sword; while it's easy to imagine this record being embraced by a relatively large audience in a way its predecessor was designed specifically not to, that audience's senses have also become dulled to Salem's once-frightening soundscapes. Not that Donoghue and Holland really try to outdo themselves on this front. Rather, they use their past aesthetic as a stepping stone.  Fires in Heaven  was mixed by Los Angeles producer  Shlohmo , but production still sounds thin and tinny, retaining the homemade feel of the past. The lyricism, however, is stronger and more purposeful. In their early work, individual tracks sounded like snippets of found footage without the context for what listeners were experiencing.  Fires in Heaven  still retains that disjointed quality as a whole, but now the individual pieces have more clearly defined beginnings, middles and ends. At times, one even gets a sense of transcendence, albeit with a fatalist bent.    While the music makes strides to move forward, lyrically the duo still seem stuck in the past. Donoghue and Holland were never strong MCs, their nihilistic lyrics teeming with casual misogyny, violence and a love of substances of all stripes. Their penchant for pitching down their voices was criticized for cultural appropriation a full 10 years ago. While drugs remain central to the Salem lyrical narrative — every song here could be interpreted as someone describing a bad trip — they've wisely tempered some of their worst lyrical instincts. The rest of these criticisms remains true today.    Given the band's reputation for barely being able to hold things together, it's a minor miracle that even a truncated version of the group was (finally) able to produce a follow-up to their cult-classic debut. Donoghue and Holland continue to be unmoved by the larger cultural forces around them, producing a record that doubles down on their best and, at times, worst impulses.

2020-10-29,Tom Piekarski,5,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC",'Magic Oneohtrix Point Never' Is a Radio Playlist with No Internal Logic,,"Magic Oneohtrix Point Neve r is something of a self-titled record. Having once misheard the station ID announcement of Boston's Magic 106.7, experimental music mainstay  Daniel Lopatin  decided to adopt the moniker of  Magic Oneohtrix Point Never  for his 2007 debut  Betrayed in the Octagon , before dropping the 'Magic' for subsequent albums.    Like some eponymous releases,  MOPN  presents a summation of everything that came before. The nod to  Betrayed in the Octagon  and the suggestion of a radio-like format primes listeners for a kind of fictitious greatest hits. Lopatin is in control of the dial, turning it to show the listener all of the musical modes Oneohtrix Point Never has occupied throughout a decade-plus career. The shredded samples of  Replica  are here. The displaced and defiled new age palette deployed so gracefully on  R Plus Seven  makes an appearance. There are even hints of the weaponized corniness of grunge and nu-metal that underpin much of  Garden of Delete .    This is one of the ways in which  MOPN  falters. The tracks that harken back to previous records mock the aesthetic focus and conceptual tenacity that Lopatin employed then. It is unclear how or why an artist historically so adept at tactfully mining nostalgia has lost that tact when the depths he is now tunneling through are musical tropes of his own making.    The album does not do much better as a celebration of radio. The ""Cross Talk"" segues provide an initial bit of charm in the way they present stitched together samples expressing the sometimes joyous and sometimes jaded relationship we have with the airwaves. Still, it is not enough to pull  MOPN  out of incoherence. Most of the album's songs lack any kind of discernible relationship to each other. That lack proves decisive. Even a radio playlist has a sort of internal logic. When you remove the landmarks that give your listeners a sense of direction, however opaque, your adventurousness starts to look more like disorientation.     MOPN  gives flashes, if only sporadically, of what Lopatin's music might sound like if firmly rooted in the present. 2018's  Age Of  first flexed Lopatin's burgeoning ability to work with more streamlined forms of songwriting, but some of that album's awkwardness was due to the fact that what we were hearing was scrapped Usher demos. In the intervening years, those scraps were pressurized into diamonds. Between Lopatin's now famous score for the film  Uncut Gems , his credits on the Weeknd's  After Hours  and the appearance of an OPN baseball cap in photos of supermodel Emily Ratajkowski, it is clear that Lopatin's output occupies an increasingly unique cultural space.     MOPN  is compelling when it leans into that space unabashedly. Tracks like ""Long Road Home,"" ""I Don't Love Me Anymore,"" ""The Whether Channel,"" and ""No Nightmares"" exemplify Lopatin's newfound confidence in his ability to write an absolute banger. It's a shame that the momentum of these tracks is stalled by an attempt to recapture the experimental grandeur of albums past.    Lopatin's pop sensibilities are already weird enough.  MOPN  would have landed much better if it abandoned the balancing act between the past and the present in exchange for wholehearted embrace of Lopatin's current realities. Lopatin has proven to us that he can deliver hits; it's time that he believes it himself.

2020-10-29,Trystan MacDonald,9,"POP AND ROCK,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS",Nothing's 'The Great Dismal' Is a Modern Shoegaze Classic,,"Nothing' s newest album  The Great Dismal  is so loud, it will certainly make up for all the concerts you haven't gone to this year.    Fans of the band have no doubt felt that Nothing has been building up to a career and compositional crescendo for a while. ""Zero Day,"" the opening track to 2018's  Dance on the Blacktop , certainly established the destination Nothing seemed to be heading with their dense, rolling waves of distortion and dissociative vocals. In an almost ironic juxtaposition,  The Great Dismal  begins with ""A Fabricated Life"" — a sleepy and misleading opening that quickly becomes insignificant in the wake of the second track, the album's first single, ""Say Less."" It is a monstrous track, displaying a total mastery over all elements of the band's sound. It is the singularity of Nothing's universe that quickly calibrates the listener for the dense sonic gravity established throughout the rest of  The Great Dismal .    The album's sound orbits around a '90s core — somehow encompassing the best characteristics of grunge jam bands, melancholy shoegaze and whatever the hell alt-rock is. The album feels familiar, and yet, refreshingly new, with a track called ""Bernie Sanders"" thrown in for good measure. It's an increasingly important characteristic, especially when everything seems so banal and lethargic with heavy music this year.     ""Catch a Fade"" is a perfect example of Nothing's ability to invoke the past with something completely original. It's an infectiously catchy tune that could easily pass off as a pop song written by Weezer's far cooler older brother. But as delightful as it sounds, below its pop-like surface lies an isolated misanthropic essence. It's a theme, well, more of a feeling, that permeates throughout the album; however, it never comes off as miserable, as the cascading walls of sound provide too much energy for the listener to just wallow in Domenic Palermo's lyricism, in all its tremendous energy and sincere honesty.    Nothing have somehow eclipsed today's tenured bands in a complete upset to what is classically defined as 'heavy music.' It took three records and 10 years for the band to refine their sound within the recent shoegaze renaissance, but  The Great Dismal  is without a doubt one of the genre's modern classics.

Through a furry of blast beats and tremolo-picking guitar passages,   Bleeding Out's  Lifelong Death Fantasy  sets itself out as the defining grindcore album of 2020. The album starts off on an expected fast pace with the title track and ""Realm of Silence."" Both of these tracks exemplify Bleeding Out's ability to effortlessly pivot from blistering grindcore to neanderthal-like sludge metal. This ability only grows more evident throughout the album, and peaks on the album's closer, ""Mechanized Decomposition"" — a perfect blend of slow, down-tuned chugs, placed between blistering blast beat sequences. When it comes to employing contrast, very few do it as well as Bleeding Out.    For a record of this nature, Bleeding Out do an excellent job with pacing. The instrumental track ""Nightmares Forged in Blood"" does an excellent job operating as a palate cleanser to prepare the listener for what is to be expected on the back-end of the album. Overall, Bleeding Out's  Lifelong Death Fantasy  an extreme metal record that delivers on all fronts.

In 2018, she gave us  Sweetener . In 2019, we got  thank u, next . Amid the bleakness of 2020, Grande released P ositions , her sixth studio album. For many artists, releasing three albums in three years might yield diminishing returns, but Grande has delivered a consistent output of music without compromising its quality.    While  thank u, next  was an album of self-realization,  Positions  is an album of self-indulgence. Throughout the album's 14 tracks, Grande sings about her life and love with minimal regard for modesty. This sentiment is captured on tracks like ""shut up,"" the album's cinematic opener, where she dismisses the critique she's received, while ""just like magic"" details how she manifests her decadent lifestyle. Clearly, it's Grande's world and we're just living in it.     Positions  has hints of classical and R&B — staples of Grande's previous work. Songs like the title track and ""love language"" weave in orchestral strings and catchy backbeats to elevate the listening experience, effortlessly meshes these contrasting genres to keep her pop sound distinctive.    The album slows down on collaborations with the Weeknd (""off the table"") and Ty Dolla $ign (""safety net"") as Grande and her collaborators sing about the hesitations of falling for someone. Other tracks, like ""34+35"" and ""nasty,"" feature an overt sexiness, both describing Grande's lust for a lover. They're in contrast to tracks like ""six thirty"" and ""obvious"" — their fluffier, but equally satisfying counterparts.    ""my hair"" delivers what is perhaps  P ositions ' most intimate moment. Grande's iconic high ponytail has been the subject of much discussion, and she uses her most distinguishing feature to convey her vulnerability, singing: ""Usually don't let people touch it / But tonight, you get a pass"" and ""So run your hands through my hair / Baby, 'cause that's why it's there.""    While  Positions  is full of confidence and lust, Grande ends on ""pov,"" a heartfelt track about insecurity and wanting to see herself from someone else's point of view. It's refreshing as Grande, one of the biggest pop stars in the world, admits she has her off moments and feels unworthy of love. It's a universal feeling Grande captures on one her best album closers so far.

2020-11-03,Kyle Mullin,7,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS",Common Faces 2020 with Optimism Rather Than Anger on 'A Beautiful Revolution Pt. 1',,"Given all the turmoil of 2020, is it time to uplift? Or burn it all down?     Common  opts for the former on   A Beautiful Revolution Pt. 1 .  The new album finds the veteran conscious MC striving to soothe and unify in the wake of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor's deaths, police altercations with  Black Lives Matter  protestors, and a pandemic that arguably hit people of colour and the impoverished the hardest.     A Beautiful Revolution Pt. 1  also stands in stark contrast, both musically and lyrically, to 2020's other major political rap album,  RTJ4 , by Com's contemporaries,  Run the Jewels .  Killer Mike  delved into the despair of Black oppression and lashed out at police and corrupt politicians, creating an instant hip-hop classic over  El-P' s fittingly abrasive beats. Common, on the other hand prefers to soundtrack 2020 with a song like ""Courageous."" Over soulful flowing keys and steely skittering drums — courtesy of a live band led by aces jazz/hip-hop pianist  Robert Glasper  — Com spits with every fibre of his being about a new kingdom awaiting Black Americans before encouraging his listeners not to speak hate or give up hope. He even goes as far as imploring the galled masses to each honour their inner child. Noble? Certainly. But is it suited for a moment like this — a moment when so many wounds feel fresh and so many of us remain angry?    Even when Common lets his own vitriol bubble up, he remains comparatively cool, calm and collected.  Lenny Kravitz  lends his revved-engine guitar licks and swaggering voice to ""A Riot in My Mind"" as Com belts out one impassioned plea for peace after the next. While the rapper approaches the commanding boom of a bullhorn, the clunky track's attributes never cohere. Common's tone is also consistently measured throughout, bordering on analytical sociology and never amounting to the call for arms found in some of 2020's best anthems. ""A Place in This World"" shares some of the strengths and weaknesses of ""Riot,"" but works better overall. Over a funky instrumental that bounces with resolute determination, Com effectively spits about injustice and phony politicians before sadly stumbling with puns about there being more ""content than character"" in the media.    Far more compelling is the moody and downcast bass driven ""Fallin."" Here, Common sounds more simmering; he never lets his coolness slip in terms of tone, but he does ruthlessly aim lyrics at ""descendants of the Dutchmen"" whose ""clutches"" are strangling his Black brethren. The MC then reveals the degree of mistrust some people have against the system, so much so that vaccines seem questionable and ripe for conspiracy theories. By capturing such a sordid state of affairs, Common rests his case for mastery of the mic.    That said, most of the tracks on  A Beautiful Revolution Pt. 1  aren't so captivatingly contradictory or nuanced. The rest of the brisk 34-minute runtime is mostly dedicated to positivity — occasionally to the point of being pollyannish. But when Com teams up with fellow conscious vet  Black Thought  over the burly beat of ""Say Peace"" to argue for a better tomorrow, it's tough for all but the most hardened cynics not to follow along, as if he were the Pied Piper of empowerment. Anyone embittered by 2020's events, or too aloof to hold out much hope, should go ahead and try to dismiss ""Courageous"" as saccharine. After all, the track boasts none other than  Stevie Wonder 's timeless harmonica bursts, along with Common's doggedly upbeat rhymes.    So, if you're eager for a soundtrack to that new dawn, you'll clamour for  A Beautiful Revolution Pt. 1 's beams of betterment. And those of us who want to remain angry may still return to  RTJ4  more often, though we must concede Common's outlook is both worth fighting for and believing in.

2020-11-04,Hayden Godfrey,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Donovan Woods Pushes Pop to Its Introspective Limits on 'Without People',,"Since bursting onto the scene nearly 14 years ago, Toronto-based singer-songwriter  Donovan Woods  has been a beacon of Canadian folk. His latest record,  Without People , was recorded remotely by Woods and company, and furthers his reputation as a steady, likeable artist.    As a whole, the record is quirkily conventional, as it takes standard pop structures and stretches them just far enough to excite a refined ear without losing some semblance of accessibility. Most passages seem pleasantly familiar, yet unique enough to be their own entities.    At times, Woods plays it safe, channelling Ed Sheeran during the poppy choruses of ""We Used To"" and ""Seeing Other People"" while doing a convincing Phillip Phillips impression on ""Clean Slate."" It might not be the most enrapturing of musical moods in this particular context, but it's incredibly an incredibly easy and fun listen.    Elsewhere, Woods experiments with layered city soundscapes on ""Without People"" and ""Interlude"" and paints beautifully intimate pictures of heartbreak and triumph on ""Whole Way Home"" and ""Whatever Keeps You Going."" Most of the album's tracks start sensibly, but then veer off in melodically intriguing directions, with the squiggly contour of ""High Season"" and the surprisingly groovy ending on ""Lonely People"" exemplifying this sharpness.    Perhaps the best blend of the two sides of Woods' writing on the album is the infectiously lush ""She Waits for Me to Come Back Down,"" which combines the rich and resonant tone of guest vocalist  Katie Pruitt  with Woods' self-deprecating hopelessness. It's this slightly off-kilter approach to songwriting that allows Woods to cleverly steer the genre's traditional form without alienating listeners.    In the most introspective way possible,  Without People  is an album that needs to be listened to more than once. It may seem typical at first glance, but digging a little deeper will reveal an earnest selection of songs laden with personality, observance and conviction.  (Meant Well)                           FOLK AND COUNTRY   MUSIC   REVIEWS   ALBUM               More Donovan Woods",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/donovan_woods_without_people_album_review
2020-11-03,Eva Zhu,8,"POP AND ROCK,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM","You Will Always' Debut LP 'Dependent, Reliant' Gets Brutally Honest About Heartbreak and Addiction",,"Hamilton emo quartet  You Will Always  are here to remind listeners that they don't have to go through life alone. The band was formed by  Counterparts  guitarist Alex Re after he went through a particularly devastating two years of heartbreak and addiction. Re realized that if he didn't pour his heart into something else, he could die — and so, You Will Always were born.     Dependent, Reliant  opens with lead single "" Brutally Honest ,"" a punchy track detailing the aforementioned heartbreak and addiction. While sad, the lyrics contain a glimmer of hope; Re seems to be finding himself again.    The second song on the LP, ""30 Days of Sun,"" speaks of the low self-esteem one is consumed with after losing someone; your mind begins spiralling, and the lyrics on this track exemplify just what you're wondering at the time: ""Why wasn't I enough for you?""    Unlike most other emo and alternative albums, the songs on this record don't all fit neatly together. Each one is a different listening experience. ""High Enough"" is especially interesting, as they utilize musical tools uncommon in emo: synth, drum machines and reverb.    The hope described in the first half of the album disappears in the regretful, doubt-ridden ""In Fantasy."" The bright guitar riffs contrast with lyrics admitting ""I failed again.""    Despite all that Re's been through and the emotional journey he takes listeners through on the LP, he ends the album with ""It's OK."" It's a welcome change in mood and reassures the listener that he's doing better.

2020-11-05,Vish Khanna,8,"FILM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Neil Young's 'Return to Greendale' Proves He Was Right All Along,,"Back in 2003,  Neil Young  brought his purposeful vision for  Greendale  to life with an ambitious, theatrical tour that touched down twice in Toronto. The second of those shows, on September 4, is captured here, both as a record and a film, and the power and prescience of this document is undeniable.    Joined by  Crazy Horse , Young had more in store for fans than a simple concert, in support of his then-latest album. Complete with stage productions and actors lip-synching to the narrative songs being sung,  Greendale  — as a record and stage show — was an uncompromising artistic statement.    Based on the fictional story of a young, purposeful environmentalist from a small farm town and her encounters with family members, authority figures, heartless corporations, police and aligned peers,  Greendale  found Young presenting his own ecological and sociocultural concerns in a relatively straight-ahead and jammy musical manner, while also transforming a rock show into a high-concept play.    The sound of the band is remarkable and Young is fiery and dynamic, playing electric and acoustic guitar, harmonica, organ, and feeding his voice through both clean and treated mics. Crazy Horse are there for him like only they can be, with bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina locked in tight, and guitarist Frank ""Poncho"" Sampedro, a normally lively stage presence, instead seated to play electric piano and keys.    They play the anthemic songs in album sequence and the set launches and lumbers. Being in the room for this particular show at the time, one could feel a building tension within an audience hoping for hits and instead, encountering a thematic (and relatively unknown because it was new) song cycle. For some of us there though, it was truly exhilarating to find Young, pushing himself and his fans to indulge in fresh, beautiful songs like ""Double E,"" ""Bandit,"" and ""Sun Green,"" instead of delving into his musical history (which did occur in the encore, not included here).    This record and  its accompanying film  are full of hard truths — about institutional negligence and malpractice when it comes to addressing and combating climate change instead of profiteering at the expense of our shared environment. This multi-generational story seemed aimed both at boomers and their heirs, emphasizing that the stewardship of Earth is a progressive, forward thinking concern that all of us should embrace.    If these sentiments still resonate, it's because Young has been singing about such things forever, before and since  Greendale , and so those who actually contemplate this album and its live counterpart on their artistic merits might well recognize them, as equal to anything else in his stirring, outspoken back catalogue.

2020-11-05,Brock Thiessen,9,"JAZZ,POP AND ROCK,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Ennio Morricone & Bruno Nicolai's 'Dimensioni Sonore' Is an Essential Masterclass in Italian Library Music,,"There's no question 2020 has been a horrible year, and an unfortunate cherry on top was the  passing  of  Ennio Morricone . After decades in music and hundreds upon hundreds of releases, the Italian soundtrack maestro left us this summer at the age of 91. As a silver lining, however, a new light is being shone on the composer, with some of his most obscure and elusive works now being unearthed. Among them is the towering  Dimensioni Sonore  — Morricone's sprawling 10-volume library set made alongside longtime collaborator  Bruno Nicolai .    Created for RCA in 1972 and now reissued in full for the first time,  Dimensioni Sonore  is ambitious, to say the least. Not only does the project consist of 10 full-length albums — with five being credited to Morricone and five to Nicolai — but  Dimensioni Sonore  finds both composers stretching their creativity to the very edge, making for some of the most forward-thinking compositions of their careers.    With  Dimensioni Sonore  not tied down to any specific film or television project, Morricone and Nicolai clearly used the opportunity to pursue their most radical and avant-garde ideas — even if the project was for a biggie label like RCA. For better or worse, this means there's a total absence of the composers' more pop-oriented sounds. There's no dreamy Edda Dell'Orso vocal lines, no bouncing bossa nova grooves, no Spaghetti Western ear wormers, and definitely no skewed bubblegum-pop songs.    That said,  Dimensioni Sonore  hardly feels out of place in Morricone and Nicolai's collective discographies. In fact, what the pair have constructed is very much in line with their more dark and experimental giallo and horror scores — though minus all the pretty bits — such as  A Quiet Place in the Country, Il Gatto a Cove Code  and  The Night Evelyn Came from the Grave .    Morricone's work with famed avant-garde collective Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza also repeatedly comes to mind, with  Dimensioni Sonore  adopting the same sort of free-form techniques you'd expect from the Group. In fact, various members of the ensemble are even included on  Dimensioni Sonore .    While this incredibly out-there, high-brow approach may be a deal breaker for some,  Dimensioni Sonore  stands one of the most fascinating and ambitious works by either composer, as they go head-first into a truly idiosyncratic realm of sound. The results are incredibly complex, as Morricone and Nicolai weave a sonic fever dream of cerebral jazz and free-form modern composition that's one serious mind fuck of a journey.    It also helps that there's some truly jaw-dropping percussion exercises and one hell of a rhythm section, with  Dimensioni Sonore  locking onto some serious grooves more than a few times. Plus there's even some wordless female vocalisms scattered throughout just to keep things extra interesting.    But while  Dimensioni Sonore  very much plays out like a unified whole, the deeper you go, the easier it is to get lost, as Morricone and Nicolai throw out a mind-breaking array of creative ideas. Despite the incredibly long runtime, no two tracks are truly alike, with a varied approach to both acoustic and electronic instrumentation preventing  Dimensioni Sonore  from ever repeating itself.    Without question,  Dimensioni Sonore  is an imposing piece of work — both on and off the turntable — and this is no doubt why the set is only now getting its first-ever vinyl reissue all these decades later. But for those up to the challenge,  Dimensioni Sonore  stands tall among the best of '70s avant-garde, serving as a stunning showcase of not just Italian library music but modern composition as a whole.

2020-11-05,Peter Boulos,7,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC",Autechre Return to Their Abstract Tendencies on 'PLUS',,"There are only a select handful of electronic music artists held in the same calibre as   Autechre . Since the early '90s, Rob Brown and Sean Booth have been contorting, shifting and mangling sound to wonderful, cacophonous effect. Over the years, their sound has delved further into abstraction, to the point where their eager fanbase has come to expect nothing less.    Enter   SIGN  —  Autechre's most recent album, preceding  PLUS  by only two weeks.  SIGN  marked a definite return to the melodic tendencies and the more structured arrangements of their earliest material. Now, on  PLUS , Autechre look boldly again to the future.    It must be said that none of the material on  PLUS  is as labyrinthine as in the most extreme moments held in any of the 8 hours of   NTS Sessions 1-4 , where the duo seemed to luxuriate in the inaccessibility of their own music. To the most ardent of Autechre's audience, this may come as a disappointment, but for the rest, it is a welcome refinement. The album's opener, ""DekDre Scap B,"" is a strong statement of things to come; immediately knottier than the introduction to  SIGN , the track is a kludged assortment of dissonant synthesis and collapsing rhythms that is filled with complexity.    The levitating and descending synthetics of ""7FM ic"" centre on a mid-tempo duo of hi-hat and kick drum to disorienting effect. In comparison, the following track, ""marhide,"" feels practically soothing, as Autechre manipulate and develop pad sounds to build and release moments of tension throughout. Neither of the two tracks are as frantic as the opener, but they are a welcome energy shift. ""ecol4"" is similar in terms of tone, but is a far more restrained, hypnotic exercise that is carried by a (mostly) steady groove that undercuts the entirety of its almost 15-minute runtime. If Autechre's music could ever be described as progressive, this would be a prime example.    In stark contrast to everything else on  PLUS,  ""lux 106 mod"" is unabashedly emotive. Lush arpeggiation and innovative modal inflections resolve satisfyingly before the frantic ""X4,"" in which warped, acidic basslines scaffold in unpredictable ways, almost alluding to the electro found on labels like CPU Recordings. ""ii.pre esc"" is a celestial affair that leads nicely into ""else 0"" — a similarly euphoric composition that ultimately shudders to ringing halt. The album ends with ""TM1 open"" — a track approaching the realms of acid techno. Echoic strings and a Moog-like staccato bassline make for a peculiar mix that ultimately proves strangely cohesive.     PLUS  is certainly a stronger example of Autechre's range than  SIGN . This does come at a cost, where the cohesion of their previous album is somewhat lost on this most recent one; this is especially telling in the latter half of the album, where the programming becomes somewhat disjointed. Nevertheless, any Autechre project is worth praise solely due to the duo's consistent aural innovation. New music from them is always a treat by any measure and given their prolific streak, it likely won't be long until we hear more.

2020-10-23,Brock Thiessen,7,"POP AND ROCK,JAZZ,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Augusto Martelli's 'Black Sound from White People' Is '70s Italy at Its Best — Just Ignore That Title,,"First things first —  Black Sound from White People  is an unfortunate album title, especially in the year 2020. But considering the title was thought up way back in early '70s Italy — and that it was no doubt coming from a place of genuine respect — it's one that should be forgiven. After all,  Augusto Martelli' s album is definitely one worth celebrating.    For many,  Black Sound from White People  marks the high-point for Martelli, who rose to fame as a composer, conductor, arranger and TV presenter. And while Martelli may not be have reached the same great heights as some of his contemporaries in creatively charged 1970s Italy, this album stands tall as top-notch piece of jazz-funk fusion of the sleaziest order.    Originally released in 1972 by Philips,  Black Sound from White People  has very much become a cult record over the years, with originals now costing collectors more than a few pretty pennies. So it makes total sense that the tastemakers at  Sonor Music Editions  would now want to step up to shine a light on a largely forgotten gem.    Right from the get-go with the jawdropper of an opener, ""Loco Love Motion,""  Black Sound from White People  packs quite the groove, weaving together swirling layers of Latin-flavoured tropicalia, Far East exotica, meat-and-potato funk and some high-minded jazz. With an airtight backing band that includes the likes of Tullio De Piscopo, Giancarlo Barigozzi and Pino Presti, the album rarely makes a misstep, with the floating, psych-minded flute lines often hitting a serious sweet spot. And though the record is largely instrumental, mantra-like spoken word pieces arise now and again to throw in a bit of extra variety.    It's no wonder several tracks from this record and others by Martelli frequently appeared on the esteemed Easy Tempo comps over the years. After all,  Black Sound from White People  recalls some of the best ""island albums"" by the likes of Piero Piccioni, Armando Trovajoli and Piero Umiliani, where a certain easiness can be found in the recordings that takes you somewhere far, far away and yet a place so familiar.

2020-10-26,Kaelen Bell,7,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",William Prince Explores the Bridge Between Indigeneity and Christianity on 'Gospel First Nation',,"William Prince 's  Gospel First Nation  is an incredibly complicated record that sounds like a summer breeze. Raised in Peguis First Nation, Prince comes from a long line of preachers and his latest is a careful and subtle navigation of his Christian upbringing and the significant role that the church has played in attempting to eliminate Indigenous identity.    It's a tricky and, to many, a likely impossible gulf to bridge. But Prince seems acutely aware that his formative associations with church and prayer are perhaps an outlier among Indigenous people, and the crux of  Gospel First Nation  is that friction.    But to hear Prince sing it, it doesn't sound much like friction at all. For all the painful histories and social intricacies at the heart of this record, it feels as though Prince has found some sort of solace at his spot between worlds.  Gospel First Nation  is his attempt to give this in-between place a song. Prince is one of Canada's finest living songwriters — capable of softening even the hardest truth into a warm reassurance.    However,  Gospel First Nation  finds him mostly singing the words of others, with only three tracks penned by Prince himself, one being the waltzing ""When Jesus Needs an Angel,"" which was written when Prince was only 14. Those familiar with Prince's first record of 2020, the beautiful  Reliever , won't be surprised by any of the music on  Gospel First Nation.  These are gospel songs in spirit more than execution, with Prince leaning into his classic country sound more completely than before. He bathes his unfussy arrangements in gentle strings, brushed percussion and glittering threads of pedal steel; when a choir does appear, it's soft and supportive, a whisper from the reeds rather than a shout from the mountaintop.    Unsurprisingly, the best song here is one of Prince's own. The title track, with its complicated sense of faith and beautiful lyrics — ""You could sit for hours and / only hear the sound of / the trees keeping the lake and sky apart"" — is the record's unquestionable peak.  Gospel First Nation  is a lovely record, one that raises difficult questions without ever asking them directly. It's a document of one man's relationship to family and faith, of reclamation and history and the unknown, suggesting that perhaps everything is connected after all.

2020-10-26,Kaelen Bell,7,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",nêhiyawak's Matthew Cardinal Drifts into Astral Ambience on 'Asterisms',,"For such improvisational, airy music, there's little breathing room on  Matthew Cardinal 's  Asterisms  — no long stretches of silence, no pieces that drift by on wisps of lonesome tone. It's a substantial and constantly shifting record — a sky of billowing clouds, heavy with texture and depth. Cardinal's debut solo record sometimes feels pulled from the same haunted waters as  nipiy , the debut full-length from his band  nêhiyawak . It's an altogether quieter and more astral creation, however, an entirely wordless snowfall.    The sounds throughout are uniform — crystalline swirls of analogue and modular synths, electric piano and tiers of processed voice, all of it dissolving in reverb — and on first listen, most individual tracks are indistinguishable from those around them. The emotional rhythms, while moving and enriching, are opaque and ambiguous. Though the pieces are described as snapshots of Cardinal's emotional and mental state at specific periods, they're unbound by any kind of narrative or obvious sonic cues — like peering into Cardinal's mind through a pane of frosted glass.    The overall effect is that of being caught on a powerful draft of wind — there is rise and fall, subtle changes in temperature and light, but you'll need to fill in the specifics yourself. There are exceptions — more obvious peaks and valleys that reveal themselves in time. The brief, pooling ""May 25th"" feels like a series of deep inhales, while the icy ""August 23rd"" moves with spidery paranoia, tense slivers of sound layering like stiff frost. It's these small glimmers of clear emotional intention that give  Asterisms  its anchor — its obscurity not due to lack of conviction, but an understanding that few things we feel are so easily explained.

2020-10-26,Bryon Hayes,7,"JAZZ,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Cloud Nothings Go Jazz on Baldi/Gerycz Duo's Cathartic 'After Commodore Perry Service Plaza',,"As the progenitor of the noisy, poppy, post-punk group,  Cloud Nothings ' Dylan Baldi doesn't immediately appear to be steeped in the American free jazz movement, but to quote an old adage, don't judge a book by its cover.    The songwriter does claim that his first paying gig involved performing jazz music for a dinner party in his native Cleveland — so really, this is nothing new for Baldi, he's just going back to his roots, allowing those subconscious urgings to stray from songcraft and let those improvisational chops loose.    All would be for naught if Baldi hadn't brought Jayson Gerycz into the Cloud Nothings fold. The drummer introduces a sense of versatility and heft to every song he performs; he is the kindling for Baldi's flint to spark a flame.      After Commodore Perry Service Plaza  is the duo's second foray into blistering free jazz, carrying on from where  Blessed Repair  left off. The proceeding begin on a rather subdued footing with ""Hermit Thrush / Vat of Oil,"" Baldi's lone saxophone calling out plaintively. Gerycz eventually answers with a skittering and faint smattering of cymbals and snare hits. Then, the fire takes hold and the pair begin to wreak havoc. There are peaks and valleys, but the energy and symbiosis are strong with these two.    Where things really get feisty is in the relatively short closing piece ""The Holy Retrievers (In Transit)."" Gerycz fires off a series of drum salvos, to which Baldi applies heaps of wailing skronk. This is intense and definitely fit for brevity, if only to allow the players not to outpace their own endurance. This final quick-burning pool of accelerant is the perfect way to cap off an intensely cathartic record.

2020-10-26,Bryon Hayes,8,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Luciane Cardassi Spans Continents and Generations on 'Going North',,"Brazilian-Canadian pianist and artist  Luciane Cardassi  has been actively pursuing her creative vision within the contemporary classical world for 20 years. Her sense of versatility and adventure leads her to explore innovative works within the musical realm, as well as to wholeheartedly embrace collaborative experiments that span modes and media. She champions new music from both her native Brazil and from Canada, and this curatorial drive is reflected in  Going North .    Cardassi has selected eight pieces, composed by artists from Brazil and Canada, that infuse her dynamic playing with electronics and her own voice. The performances are presented as individual microcosms that encapsulate unique aspects of her experience. Having had a personal connection with all of the composers at some point in her career, Cardassi's selections feel incredibly personal and are furnished with emotional weight.    Of course, Cardassi knows her way around the piano. She possesses a keen understanding of the many vocabularies that the instrument offers, especially when extended techniques are employed. The vocal elements, the electronics and pre-recorded passages and all equally effective; together, the components coalesce into a whole – if one aspect were missing, there would be a void left unfilled.    This sense of completeness becomes apparent immediately with ""AhojAhoj,"" composed by Terri Hron. Cardassi's raw piano manipulations are augmented by the voices of the composer's relatives— recordings of her parents communicating with relatives located in Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia. There is a sense of temporal dislocation in the way Hron incorporates sounds from the cassette deck used to make and play back these recordings that were sourced from decades past, yet Cardassi's piano is locked in synchronicity with the electro-acoustic sounds, rounding off the narrative.     Going North  concludes with Cardassi performing a piece written by late composer Fernando Mattos, to whom she dedicated the album. Mattos was a contemporary of Cardassi in Brazil, a close friend, and her first collaboraor. On ""The Boat Sings,"" the pianist weaves a guitar improvisation performed by the composer himself into her own piano playing. The resulting piece is incredibly moving, as Cardassi engages in a posthumous duet with someone she respects and holds dear.

Produced by Montreal's  Lucatheproducer ,  Little Italy  explores a doomed relationship — one that Cinzia had her own hand in destroying.     Little Italy  tells a linear story; the four-track EP opens with ""Under Control"" — a spacey, sad, piano-based ballad, where Cinzia's  Florence + The Machine  influence shines bright. The opener describes an emotional push-and-pull with a love interest, where she denies her own feelings and pushes her potential lover away.    ""Can't Let You Love Me"" follows Cinzia's fear of vulnerability as she refuses to open up to her love interest. Always a talented vocalist, the track falters not for lack of technique, but originality, since   the beat and echoing background vocals leave you wishing Cinzia took more of a risk.    Title track ""Little Italy"" is the strongest track on the EP; the song is both an apology and confession, where Cinzia admits to ruining relationships with the people she loved out of fear of intimacy. The footsteps, grain and mumbles of a crowd seemingly plucked from past memories turn ""Little Italy' into a nostalgic track, transporting you to a time you wish you could rewind.    ""RUNAWAY"" wraps up the EP with a triumphant declaration of self-acceptance. Mistakes have been made, relationships have changed for the worse, but Cinzia is done with sitting in self-pity. She's ready to move forward and leave her past behind. The brightest of the four tracks, Cinzia has released the weight holding her down. Her unbeaten vocals surround clapping hands, a plucky guitar and an atmospheric beat that will have you itching to take to the road.    Cinzia faces her own flaws — the personal failings that many of us have trouble admitting. Judging by the lyrics here, she's made bad choices that hurt the people she loves. By the end of  Little Italy , she admits her wrongdoings and apologizes to the people she hurt, in order to find the space to heal and grow into a stronger, more well-rounded person.  Little Italy  is a vulnerable and honest debut that sets the artist on the path to a promising catalogue.

This series of quick classic punk tracks has been drenched in a much heavier fuzz distortion than heard on past releases, ultimately giving the album a much fuller sound. The group has continued with their exploration of keys and sound effects, specifically heard on ""Cop Kar,"" ""Lose My Mind"" and ""Wurms."" With these notable additions comes an authentic atmosphere shift, transporting you to the days of catastrophic mosh pits.    The album artwork and song titles exemplify the band's thoughts on the reality of the current climate — not just seen in America, but through the impressions of those around the globe. It's no secret that, while simplistic and to-the-point, these songs take on a strong message for themselves. With so much to express in just 17 minutes, the Spits' anger, pain, stress and frustration powers a wind-up of rage.     VI  is an ode to the roots of punk-rock — stripped back and exposed to its purest form. There are crippling moments of nostalgia and definite growth since the Spits' debut self-titled album. It's a perfect homage without even trying.

Lousy Riders , on the other hand, utilize this wonderful grey area that explores a wide range of subgenres to the best of their abilities.     Lousy Riders'  End of Light  sends its listeners on an emotional rollercoaster that is unlike any other in heavy music. Melody reigns supreme throughout the record — whether it is the biker groove on ""Black Box,"" the vocal chorus on ""Forever"" or the off-beat swing of ""Orphans,"" there is something unexpected throughout the album. Just when the listener has settled into what they feel the album will offer,  End of Light  offers something completely different.    Often considered a faux pas in the genre, Lousy Riders have utilized guitar solos in a way that contributes to the album in a meaningful way, including the shredding passages on ""Forever"" and the full on blues assault of ""Kill My Young.""  End of Light  can be enjoyed in a variety of ways.

2020-10-28,John Amen,7,"PUNK,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",The OBGMs Offer an Undiluted Punk Manifesto on 'The Ends',,"The OBGMs ' version of punk is one of unadulterated confrontation and catharsis, a visceral response to contemporary life, the durability of conditioning and the crippling effects of dualism.    The follow-up to their 2017 debut,  The Ends  opens with ""Outsah,"" a riff-y and atmospheric grunge track, with Densil McFarlane's mix of guitars, Joseph Brosnan's bass and Colanthony Humphrey's drums driving the onslaught, and McFarlane's screaming vocals conveying a sense of explosive urgency. McFarlane snarls and shrieks on ""Cash,"" the tuneful chorus reminiscent vocally and melodically of  David Bowie 's ""Suffragette City."" ""Triggered"" is an adrenalized holler-fest accompanied by a bulldozer alloy of straightforward instrumentation. ""Karen O's"" brings to mind the heavier side of  Jane's Addiction . The album's closer, ""Move On,"" is a blistering anthem, a pop-sensitive melody buried alive in a palimpsest of saw-toothed guitars, sledgehammer bass and jackhammer drums.    The OBGMs' primary debt is probably to  Bad Brains , though one can also detect the impact of  Public Enemy ,  Rage Against the Machine ,  Living Colour ,  Bleach -era  Nirvana , and the classic punk lineage –  Sex Pistols ,  Clash ,  Black Flag , et al. That is to say, the OBGMs have absorbed and reconfigured the work of their progenitors, crafting their own amalgam of guitar-driven punk. Rather than tackling specific issues via accessible lyricism, McFarlane tends to use his voice instrumentally – tonally more so than verbally transmitting rage, sorrow and indignation, as well as a volatile sense of ambivalence.     The Ends  is founded on that perennial blend of confidence and self-loathing, a paradox that seems to be part and parcel of most successful punk rock. The directness and propulsive nature of the album serves as an undiluted manifesto — about Blackness in the Western world, and about an individual navigating the hard lines of groupthink – a punk purge during the age of division.

2020-10-29,Matt Bobkin,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Like a Motorcycle Rip the Music Industry a New One on 'Dead Broke',,"I try to avoid reading the press materials for an album until I've given it a few listens, because it can too often be easy to just rehash it for the review, sprinkling in a few observations here and there to pad it out. But even without the literature on  Dead Broke , the scorching new album from Halifax punks  Like a Motorcycle , the album's subtext is obvious: they got burned, badly, by a record deal gone wrong. And they're fucking pissed about it. With  the music industry basically on life assistance  and touring a non-viable option for the foreseeable future, Like a Motorcycle have picked the perfect time to drop a furious take-down of a system that profits off of musicians without so much as giving them the basic support they need.    It sets the stage for a high-octane album that doesn't let up for a second over its 13 tracks and 30-minute runtime. With murky basslines and spiny bursts of guitars, Like a Motorcycle take on the world, from the predatory practices that squeeze out every last drop of humanity from bright-eyed youngsters to the celebrity-industrial complex at large. The lyricism is sharp and to-the-point, and the music sounds like  Cloud Nothings  performing to arena-sized crowds, ready to rouse the audience into setting fire to basically everything.    Built around a series of hook-laden singles like ""Satan Does the Numbers,"" ""Swept Out"" and ""Wide Awake,"" the record makes their anti-capitalist missives as clean and easy to digest as possible. There are plenty of rock riffs and shoutable lyrics (personal favourites are ""They've been telling me 'I'm my own enemy,' so I chewed up every hand that was feeding me"" and ""If you don't work then you won't eat either"") to chew on as the messages lodge themselves into listeners' brains. But  Dead Broke , with its cheap dinner imagery and shouted yelps against injustice, is at its core a punk album — ""Work,"" a minute-long blast with a single lyric repeated ad nauseam (""If I die tonight, then I won't have to work tomorrow if I don't wake up"") has just as much pathos as the record's more fleshed-out, pop-structured songs.    For all of  Dead Broke 's venomous, moody explorations, there's a sense of triumph and accomplishment in overcoming a seemingly never-ending series of obstacles and conflicts with ideals intact. On closing track ""Wide Awake,"" Like a Motorcycle send the record off with one last middle finger at the world that tried to keep them down — along with one last reminder of the unsustainability of it all: ""I'm unable to breathe, what a relief I made this far / I'm unable to breathe, hard to believe I made it.""    Like a Motorcycle don't deal in subtlety:  Dead Broke  is in-your-face and obvious with its insults, and is all the better for it. By not aiming for some sort of vague universality, Like a Motorcycle infuse each of  Dead Broke 's songs with a searing specificity that makes it a refreshing jolt of building-burning punk rock, brimming with fury and life.

2020-10-21,Anthony Augustine,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Mountain Goats Channel the Spirit of Memphis on 'Getting into Knives',,"Dismissing the idea of allowing 2020 to go to waste,  Getting Into Knives  is the follow-up to  John Darnielle 's solo album,  Songs for Pierre Chuvin , which the  Mountain Goats ' bandleader recorded on a boombox over the month of March following the COVID-19 induced shutdowns that scuttled the band's intentions to record in North Carolina and then hit the road for the better part of the year.    With the music industry on pause, the group worked within the ongoing tension and headed to Memphis, Tennessee  —  the city known as the spiritual centre for blues, soul and country music. Recording at Elvis' favourite post-show hangout in Memphis, Sam Philips Studio,  Getting into Knives  would serve as a counterpoint to the stripped-back lo-fi feel of  Songs for Pierre Chuvin , with an open-door policy giving the album a spontaneous, off-the-floor vibe that only comes from a group of musicians comfortable enough to let the song serve as the guideline, never letting ego clutter their art.    Right from the brushed snares, the doubled-up vocals and Darnielle's staccato delivery on ""Corsican Mastiff Stride,"" it's clear the collaborative live vibe of the past 19 albums was going to come shining through. Anchored by the vibrant percussion work of Jon Wurster,  Getting into Knives  moves from the rock-flavoured ""As Many Candles as Possible"" to more piano-fronted cuts, including ""The Last Place I Saw You Alive"" and ""Wolf Count.""    Pulled together over a busy week in Memphis this past summer, many of the songs examine elements of time — things passing on or reflecting on emotions that drive us to do the things we do. Although at times Darnielle's wordplay can come across as a series of unrelated platitudes, it's not indicative of the rest of the songwriting.    Spread out over 13 songs, it's apparent that the spirit of Memphis inspired the album, with touches of country, jazz and rock meeting with the folk tradition that are the root of the group's songwriting. Such a wide breath of influences can come across as convoluted in the hands of less-skilled musicians, but Darnielle has always had the right people around him to understand his vision, whether its voluble tracks like ""Rat Queen"" or the stripped-back shuffle of the title track.

Their fifth album,  The Jungle , is the band's most melodic, rhythmic and textural sequence to date, as well as their most authentic-sounding, devoid of posturing and contrivance. As a result,  The Jungle  shows Plants and Animals claiming a consummate aesthetic, the band's eccentricities coming to stylistic fruition.    The album opens with the title song, featuring a sinewy bass and electronic-sounding drums, ambiently percussive sounds that conjure sultry locales, moody synths wafting atop the danceable rhythms. Melodic lines weave around and between Warren Spicer's and Adèle Trottier-Rivard's complementary vocals. On staccato bass-driven ""House on Fire,"" Spicer offers a vocal and melodic tribute to  David Byrne , the band crafting an irresistible hybridization of  The Suburbs -era  Arcade Fire  and  Talking Heads  circa  Remain in Light .    With ""Get My Mind,"" the band slow the pace and embrace a lo(wer)-fi production approach, opening with an acoustic guitar, the addition of raucous instrumentation contrasting effectively with Spicer's breathy and delicate vocal. ""In Your Eyes"" is the most buoyant track on the album, evoking an optimistic and pop-sensitive vibe. The album closes with ""Bold,"" spotlighting some of the set's most lavish textures and seductive hooks.    Since their debut, each of Plants and Animals' releases have drawn from recognizable precedents and playbooks, their sets built on signature rearrangements and reconfigurations.  The Jungle , too, clearly displays its references; this album's transmutations, however, are the band's most consistently sublime and seem to have been rendered effortlessly in comparison to previous work.

Adam Byczkowski, has found a vent for passionate, pull-on-your-heartstrings torch songs on the Berlin underground circuit, cultivating a reputation for silky sophisti-pop and evocative 80s Europop, as championed on 2016 six-track  It's Only You . Recent support slots on tour with  TOPS  have also served to promote the singer-songwriter's name amongst certain indie-pop circles.  Something to Lose 's genesis is subsequently borne out of successive time spent between Montreal, Los Angeles and Berlins — an experience that found Byczkowski striking up a creative partnership with  MGMT 's Ben Goldwasser.     Better Person's first full-length LP represents a more expansive state of affairs, to some extent, affording more breathing room to the emotionally craving lyrical space inhabited on preceding outings. The influence of acts such as Deacon Blue and  Sade  is alluded to, while tracks such as ""True Love"" hint towards  the Radio Dept. 's synth-heavy moments. ""Close To You"" similarly revolves around an electro-beat strut, alongside Byczkowski channelling a pining,  Mark Hollis -esque vocal croon. This results in tonal peaks and troughs, morphing between the unrequited and peppy, examples including the Style Council-level of simmer applied on ""Bring Me to Tears,"" words steeped in poignancy: ""Oh, crash my heart to pieces / I wanna try something I can feel.""      Something to Lose  is evidence of Better Person committing further to terrain covered on his earlier EP, mining often overlooked musical traditions with obvious enthusiasm and yearning credibility, an effect that is elevated when paired with Goldwasser's expertise.

They were no longer a couple once the album was being mixed.    In the first track, ""Freedom Feeling,"" Veirs sings, ""I'm sighing for all the dreams deferred and I'm searching for that freedom feeling, for you, for you, for me."" The sound and sentiment conveyed in the album is less sombre and sad as it is complex and expansive. The album should be unsettling — but it isn't.    Veirs is primarily a folk musician and this is still primarily a folk album but with some additional influences. Throughout the album, the presence of the Bizarre Stars Strings (Patti King on violin, Kyleen King on viola and Anna Fritz on cello) gives the sense of grandeur, with orchestral swells heard here and there, while Justin Chase's synth repertoire give a post-human sound.    For contrast, ""End Times"" features just Veirs singing and playing the piano. Veirs admits to intentionally steering away from a downcast sound at times; ""Turquoise Walls"" is composed of playful banjo and Nashville guitar against despondent lyrics about being in the room that she painted with her then-husband.

2020-10-21,Scott Roos,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM",The North Sound Walk a Different Country Road on 'As the Stars Explode',,"As the Stars Explode , the sophomore outing from Saskatoon-based country roots rockers  the North Sound , is a slick, radio friendly record punctuated by the songwriting guile and instrumental prowess of Blackfoot singer-songwriter Forrest Eaglespeaker backed by Nevada Freistadt's tight, crisp harmonies. Collectively drawing comparisons to  Steve Earle ,  the Allman Brothers ,  Crosby, Stills and Nash  and fellow Saskatchewanian country artist  JJ Voss , it's no small wonder that this group has garnered the attention they have, with several singles landing in the top spot of the national Indigenous Music Countdown.    After a somewhat bizarre, hip-hop-esque spoken word introduction, the record kicks off with the rollicking ""Young, Dumb, Drunk and Not Doing So Good"" and stellar single ""Between the Ditches."" Eaglespeaker then gets political with highlight track ""This Land,"" where he weighs in on the Colten Boushie tragedy with the frustration and cynicism of someone who has, no doubt, seen plenty of these sorts of situations transpire during his lifetime. Topically, much of  As the Stars Explode  is making not necessarily political statements but more or less serving to tell Eaglespeaker's story as he examines, sometimes in great detail, the events he has lived and worked through, such as addiction and sobriety, mental health and intergenerational trauma.    Eaglespeaker offers a fresh take, both musically and lyrically on  As the Stars Explode.  The album takes a different route compared to the usual country music norms that at times stifle the genre, and it really works.      (Independent)                           MUSIC   REVIEWS   FOLK AND COUNTRY   ALBUM              More North Sound",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/the_north_sound_as_the_stars_explode_album_review
2020-10-21,Matt Yuyitung,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Northcote's Authenticity Shines on 'Let Me Roar',,"It's hard to dislike  Matthew Goud .  Let Me Roar , his latest record as  Northcote , shows an artist eager to please with frank, heart-on-sleeve lyricism and comforting acoustic arrangements. Reminiscent of the earnest energy of indie-folk acts like  the Head and the Heart ,  Frank Turner  and  Passenger , Goud's latest is a brief but enjoyable statement geared towards winning listeners over with its easygoing, folksy charm.    Goud works hard to create an intimate, welcoming space on  Let Me Roar  and he largely succeeds. The record benefits strongly from its warm production touches, including lots of ringing lead guitar lines and light synthesizer backdrops. Tracks like ""Keep on Saying Goodbye"" bring an emphatic vocal performance on one of the record's stronger choruses, while ""Streets of Gold"" is a more stripped back affair that uses background synth pad touches well.    Goud is not immune to overly clichéd lyrical clunkers, but his earnest and genuine delivery makes it easy to forgive him. His approach to lyricism on  Let Me Roar  suggests he's not necessarily mining for profound truths, but rather letting his own perceptions speak for themselves. It makes for a pleasant, likeable record, where it's hard not to be disarmed by Goud's authenticity.

2020-10-22,Vish Khanna,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Jeff Tweedy Wrings Joy from Today's Wilderness on 'Love Is the King',,"Wilco  vocalist  Jeff Tweedy , backed up by his sons Sammy and Spencer, spends most of the pandemic-produced,  Love Is the King , crying out from the new wilderness of self. The vibe is folk, rock, country and kind of homespun and laidback but, like early  John Lennon  records, there is sharpness to the starkness.    To counter anxiety and chaos, some long for parameters that might help them focus. In keeping with his endearingly useful new book,  How to Write One Song , Tweedy and his boys strove to compose and record a single song a day in Wilco's own Chicago studio, the Loft. Far from scrappy, each of these tunes feels fresh with the spark of invention, while also revealing something about the players; their raw instincts are on display — their feelings as musicians and as people.    Jeff has been playing with words a lot more as of late but seems particularly drawn to economic, efficient language, finding poetry in stretched out syllables that make existence last a little longer. See the countrified ""Opaline"" and its vivid, to-the-point scenes: ""There's nothing worse / than a hearse / driving slow."" Hurry up, death! I've got end of the road rage!    The mortality mania continues on ""A Robin or a Wren,"" which also skews sonically to Tweedy's country music past and reflects upon not wanting to die. ""Even I Can See"" is more plaintive — an ode to his wife and a lifetime of love, which is, most unexpectedly, under external threat. The record has lovely acoustic instrumentation, but there are also playfully upbeat arrangements like ""Natural Disaster,"" which sounds like late-'60s  Dylan  taking a twirl with late-'70s  Neil . Again though, it's a song where the analogy is that love is a natural disaster. Some dark stuff.    Imagine writing one song a day during April 2020 when there's a pandemic raging and nobody knows what's going to happen or how to live anymore; you'd probably play a lot of sick guitar solos with your kids, taking some joy in the wildness and the comfort of such a dynamic, but mostly, you'd sing your new sad songs fairly evenly, fearful that too much emotion might somehow provoke the virus.    Instead, you try to chill, whistling while you work (literally) and appreciating that when there's no choice in the matter; love rules all and that's got to be enough for Jeff Tweedy when the world falls apart.

2020-10-22,Vish Khanna,8,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Bruce Springsteen Is at His Rawest and Most Reflective on 'Letter to You',,"A reverential, loyal dude,  Bruce Springsteen  has long carried himself like someone who owes his good fortune to those who came before him. As singular and iconic as his musical trajectory has been, Springsteen has shaped his songs and his live revue of a show distinctively and originally — feats that may scream 'That's the Boss!' but bear traces of all of his musical and cultural influences. Some emanate from heroes he's never met, some from the friends and players who got him started in his earliest days in New Jersey.    On  Letter to You , Springsteen is at his rawest and most reflective. He and his beloved  E Street Band  sought some kind of urgency here, recording 12 songs in four days, live off-the-floor with no overdubs in the Boss' home studio. They've never taken such a tack before, and based on the record's tribute to both youthful, auspicious expression and those who are lucky to tend to enduring legacies, this is one of rock's finest writers — following up both a memoir and an acclaimed run for his storytelling Broadway show — with a song-based historical meditation, that finds him getting meta about his whole public life.    On the powerful ""Last Man Standing,"" Springsteen acknowledges his boyhood friends from his first band, the Castiles, all of whom have now passed away. He writes with a survivor's guilt but also of the joyful persistence it takes for someone to never surrender their dreams to some boring, waking life. The same impulse has surely guided Springsteen to unearth three songs from his early-'70s, solo-acoustic demo for  Columbia Records : ""Janey Needs a Shooter,"" ""If I Was the Priest"" and ""Song for Orphans.""    It's one thing for a 71-year-old to sound as strong vocally as Springsteen does; it's another to hear him transform into his 20-year-old self, slipping into that younger way of singing, phrasing, and particular way of vocab-rapping (on early Springsteen records, he attempted to use all of the words in the English language available at the time). If the fidelity of the recordings was a bit rougher, we'd be fooled into thinking these were vintage performances, though the band are better now than they were pre-1975.    It's a bit bizarre, Bruce Springsteen emerging with a love letter to the very act of being in a rock'n'roll band with your friends and storming the world with a tight, killer show, when all of that has been suspended. That said, we need this reminder about the spirit that galvanizes us and the spark that first got us into music, as both performers and fans.  Letter to You  may well be Springsteen addressing his most significant bandmates and his audience with love, but it may as well be something he wrote and sent ahead to 2020.

The album begins strong and familiar, but the epic doom metal odyssey that was to be expected quickly turns into a brooding, meandering walk to nowhere.    It sounds ridiculous to say it, but some of these songs just go on way too long, a statement once so unthinkable to utter regarding the band's music. The band's ""ability to navigate away from the monotony of repetition"" that we praised on 2017's  Heartless  is missing on  Forgotten Days . ​The overdriven weight of the guitars that forge the very cornerstone of Pallbearer's sound are quickly brought to heel by the second song and don't fully emerge again until the end of the album. Gone are the crushing riffs and transitions, replaced with subdued progressions. It's a real blight on much of the record, unable to keep the listener enthralled or interested.    The album reclaims some glory towards the end with it reaching a climax at the emergence of the title track carrying on and arriving at a destination resembling the strength of Pallbearer's earlier albums on the final three tracks. While the shift in Pallbearer's composition isn't swift or particularly extreme, fans of Pallbearer's foundational albums can only hope that the future direction of the band doesn't go the way of  the Sword .

2020-10-22,Sydney Brasil,7,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The Elwins May or May Not Have Found God on 'IV',,"Sparing no subtleties when it comes to religious imagery, it's uncertain whether  The Elwins  have found God on  IV , their aptly titled fourth album, or there's supposed to be some higher literary meaning. The deeper you get into the record, the more obvious these references become. It starts on the galloping snares of ""Let Her Be the One,"" with a chorus that appropriately repeats ""My God, let her be the one."" This follows through to ""Daughter Song,"" detailing the crucifixion of Jesus.    Something about the string arrangements and chord progressions of these reverent songs reveals a folk-pop inspiration, giving a sense of optimism. These tracks, as well as the rest of the album, show what has always been true of the Elwins; they're lyrically simple, but just a touch corny. However, there's still enough charm to remember the roaring choruses with fondness.    Despite these new flares,  IV  is still chock full of familiar Elwins-esque regional pop-rock and it makes sense that this would be the natural next step for the band. They've retained enough of their original sound to not draw attention to themselves while continuing to settle comfortably into the indie pop paradigm of southern Ontario.    Though it's mostly a tame album, there's a muffled saxophone solo on ""Slow Motion"" that breaks up the chant-along anthems;  IV  is pretty solo-heavy generally, this one stands out because of its simplicity. By switching out the guitars just this once, it adds a suaveness and gives a sense of attitude. There's enough to show that the Elwins know how to write fun and catchy songs, but whether you like it or not, this record will live in your head rent-free.

2020-10-19,Matthew Blenkarn,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Loma Prove Brian Eno Right on 'Don't Shy Away',,"Loma  never seemed long for this world. Originally a side project for  Shearwater 's Jonathan Meiburg and Cross Record's Emily Cross and Dan Duszynski, the group were already in jeopardy before they released their slowcore-indebted debut. Cross and Duszynski divorced during the recording process, throwing the album's release into question. It did come out, and a long supporting tour followed, but the idea of a follow-up – let alone one featuring all three members – appeared dubious.    Against all odds, Loma are back, and  Brian Eno  deserves partial credit. The ambient icon praised the trio's 2017 single ""Black Willow"" in a radio appearance, and his words helped motivate the band to reconvene.  Don't Shy Away  is the result of that reformation, and it finds Loma in a more experimental mode. There's even an Eno contribution on the album's closer, ""Homing.""    At first, the shift is subtle: the presence of woodwinds on opener ""I Fix My Gaze,"" the horn interlude on lead single ""Ocotillo."" As the album proceeds, though, the arrangements become more diverse and the compositions reflect broader influences. A koto forms the backbone of ""Elliptical Days,"" and there's a hint of  Steve Reich  to the energetic piano line snaking through ""Breaking Waves Like a Stone."" If ""Thorn"" brings early  Portishead  to mind, ""Given a Sign"" is closer to synthpop. Straddling genres is nothing new for Loma – their first album blurred the lines between folk and a few strands of '90s indie rock – but  Don't Shy Away  pushes that ethos further without sacrificing cohesion.    In fact, the new record seems like an inverse of Loma. Where that record retained an analog warmth,  Don't Shy Away  is its colder digital counterpart. The cathartic dynamic shifts are gone, replaced with subdued crystalline hooks on tracks like ""Half Silences"" and ""Don't Shy Away."" It makes for more understated listening, maybe, but it's no less stirring.    All of which makes the band's return a welcome one.  Don't Shy Away  is ultimately as gratifying as it is ambitious. Brian Eno was right: Loma are the real deal.

's second horrorcore opus is unavoidable. Like a slasher movie sequel,  Visions of Bodies Being Burned  goes for the jugular with Daveed Diggs' lethal flows, mind-bending production from William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes, and an impressive host of guests.    The central loop of ""Say the Name'' derives from the  Geto Boys  classic ""My Mind Is Playing Tricks on Me"" — an apt summation of this album's stylistic foundation. Over a dynamic, slow-burning beat, Diggs hinges tales of racial injustice around the Candyman — the hook-handed, vengeful spirit of a lynching victim. Coupled with immersive soundscapes, Diggs' sordid storytelling and cutting commentary reinstate clipping. as horrorcore overlords.    Be it the harsh noise jump scare of ""Intro"" or the hair-raising dissonance of ""Invocation,"" clipping. approaches hip-hop like horror cinema. Similarly, the accidental demon summoning skit ""Wytchboard"" and the zombie horde field recording ""Drove"" evoke sleazy B-movies. Speaking of zombies, Diggs envisions a swamp full of cannibals on ""Eaten Alive."" Adorned with Ted Byrnes' percussive collage and jazz experimentalist Jeff Parker's anti-riffs, the song is absolutely spine-tingling.    Replacing the vampiric undertones of  There Existed  with undead imagery, ""Pain Everyday"" finds Michael Esposito's string arrangements mourning the wrongfully killed, while Diggs calls for resurrecting and wreaking havoc. He elaborates on this idea with ""Something Underneath,"" spitting reanimated retribution with incredible speed and raw ability over disjointed, distorted feedback blasts. His revenge fantasies get more brooding during the droning harmonies and sub-bass pulses on ""Make Them Dead,"" and reach a climax with ""Body for the Pile."" A plunderphonic tapestry of loading and firing guns, clattering bullet shells and wailing sirens follows the bloody trail of a spectral cop killer: ""three little pigs and they can't do nothing.""    Diggs' conceptual scope manifests in the savage empowerment of  ""96 Neve Campbell,""  an ode to the ""final girl"" of many a horror flick: ""This bitch boss / Come in talkin that shit / And you gon' have to die about it."" With killer bars from the fatal twosome Cam & China, the song's crisp clap-track and metallic clangs hit as hard as the cacophonous manslaughter anthem ""Looking Like Meat."" The punkish abandon of Ho99o9 supercharges this song's clipped bass and whacking backbeat, as well as its tough-talker-meets-pure-evil mantra. There's two ways to interpret ""wear that face out,"" and neither sound pleasant.    For all the heady subject matter and sounds akin to  Coil  or  Prurient , this album actually offers more for fans of Gravediggaz and the old-school Memphis sound. Deep cuts like the hushed, paranoid bounce of ""Check the Lock"" and the rattling abstract trap of ""Enlacing"" give  Visions  more hip for its hop than  There Existed .    Back with arguably more certified bangers than before, clipping. throws caution to the wind with soul-rending sonics and elite-tier rapping.

2020-10-20,Chris Gee,9,"ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK",Adrianne Lenker Distills Complex Feelings into 'songs',,"At the start of the pandemic and amid a breakup,  Big Thief 's  Adrianne Lenker  hid out at a cabin in the mountains in western Massachusetts — surely a good decision during a time of heightened uncertainties. For most artists, isolating in the woods to record an album sounds like a terribly overdone gimmick. But for Lenker, it seems entirely natural for her to recharge and reset among the whispering trees and chittering birds, as she has done in the past with or without the rest of the band. Perhaps it's how Lenker is able to write music at a remarkable rate, releasing at least one or two records per year since Big Thief's debut  Masterpiece  in 2016, all of which are adored by her rapidly growing fanbase and critics alike.    This time around, Lenker recorded not one but two new solo albums, appropriately titled  songs  and  instrumentals . The former is a collection of visceral tunes featuring only acoustic guitar and Lenker's soft-spoken voice. The freshness of the mountain air seems to permeate these incredibly raw recordings, as Lenker aligns her nurturing candor with internal healing and reckoning.    ""dragon eyes"" is thoroughly grieving, with an effortlessly fluid melody recorded as if Lenker were quietly strumming right next to you as she tenderly weeps, ""as the coastline is shaped by the wind, as we make love and you're on my skin, you are changing me."" Similarly exuding similar grace, ""ingydar"" is hopeful with Lenker gently playing her guitar in time with the gradual pace of the nature around her. Lenker's observational words wrap around peculiar tempos, creating intense imagery that is dripping in nuance. The way Lenker softly sings lines like ""the juice of dark cherries cover his chin"" and ""chewing a cigarette and repeating shadows of words I said"" evoke an understanding that there is an unspoken, heavier meaning than the commonplace yet tender moments on the surface.    Lenker's songwriting is driven by her intuitive sense of emotion and spirituality, intertwining them in ways that become grounded and tangible. ""come"" begins with the pitter patters of raindrops and Lenker zeroing in on a mood that feels transparent and right on her acoustic guitar, techniques that she later explores further on  instrumentals . On album closer ""my angel,"" Lenker methodically works her way through spindly guitar before focussing on the repeated refrain of the title of the song, a reflection on an ex-lover.    It's easy to imagine Lenker's delicate, finger-picked songs like ""two reverse"" and ""anything"" being turned into full-fleshed Big Thief tunes with the simple crackle of a snare or scraggly electric guitar garnish, but for now they are naked and beautiful — a moment of mending for Lenker untouched by reinterpretation. Lenker's work continues to reimagine love and loss, and albums like  songs  are her way of turning those complex emotions into something timeless.

2020-10-20,Chris Gee,8,"MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Having Trouble Meditating? Adrianne Lenker's 'instrumentals' Might Help,,"On  instrumentals ,  Adrianne Lenker  of  Big Thief  works through a session of restorative musical therapy, enabling feelings of self-awareness and peace. Recorded as a companion piece to the more traditional  songs  while she isolated in a small cabin in the mountains at the start of the pandemic, Lenker sifts through a range of autumnal moods as she calmly makes her way on the acoustic guitar for two long, improvised wordless songs.    Throughout the record, Lenker's nimble fingers work their way up and down her fretboard, feeling out the auras and spaces around her at those exact moments. We hear her fingertips lightly brush against each individual string and the creaks of the guitar's wooden exterior brushing up against her body as Lenker shifts positions to express a slightly new angle of emotion. It's a rough, raw and deeply intimate glimpse inside Lenker's wildly creative mind, sprawling towards different directions, exploring the duality of love and loss that stems from a single seed of emotion.  instrumentals ' A-side, ""music for indigo,"" is Lenker's heartbreaking journey through processing a recent breakup. There are repetitive harmonics, painfully heavy sighs, and bright, uplifting bouts of energy scattered throughout like freshly fallen pine needles.    Sometime during ""music for indigo,"" Lenker exhales, ""I'm starting over"" and, just like the wind changing direction, her strumming tenderly moves into a soft wave of relief and tranquility before neatly folding into the second half of the album, aptly titled ""mostly chimes."" On  instrumentals ' B-side, Lenker's rangy guitar is accompanied by playful songbirds just outside her window before the aforementioned chimes makes its pacifying entry. Seemingly unaffected by this instrumental shift, the birds continue their distant chirps and twitters to the rhythm of their own daily lives of catching worms and mating rituals.    This part of the record is entirely devoted to coaxing the listener into a meditative trance with the calming sounds of ASMR-like rustling of leaves and unexplained soft-socked footsteps. On  instrumentals , Lenker settles down from  songs ' busier thoughts, indulging in the stoicism within to achieve moments of serenity, if only briefly. Deep breaths, everyone.

Each song tackles sovereignty from a different angle, amplifying the message with searing guitar solos and Segall's incendiary drumming.    From the get-go,  III  is raw — the minimalistic production allows sharp edges to sing, and the album feels like it could be a live recording. ""Returning"" kicks things off with an explosive storm of drums and larger-than-life riffs. ""Spit,"" which rattles rhythmically as though on the verge of falling apart, is followed by ""Time Collapse,"" a meditation on wholeness in isolation that disintegrates into melodic chaos. On ""Nothing People,"" we hear ""I'm not telling you how to sing, I'm gonna do my thing,"" and that is exactly what the trio does for all eight tracks of the record. The result is playful, but never loses focus.     III  is fuzzy, fast-paced and ferocious in all of the ways we would expect from FUZZ.

2020-10-20,Daryl Keating,8,"MUSIC,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",'Maya' Blows John Frusciante's Previous Electronic Forays Out of the Water,,"""Give me a motherfuckin' breakbeat."" These aren't exactly the words you'd normally associate with long-time  Red Hot Chili Peppers  guitarist  John Frusciante , but they're the first ones you hear on his new album,  Maya . The whole record, in fact, is inspired by his favourite type of music: '91 to '96 UK breakbeat hardcore and jungle.    This might come as a bit of surprise to some, even to fans of his  Trickfinger  pseudonym, which flexes his acid techno muscles. There were lesser-known hints of Frusciante moving towards this style though, particularly his 2010 joint effort with  Venetian Snares  (whose record label is putting out  Maya ) and Chris MacDonald, titled  Speed Dealer Moms  — a short EP of cacophonous blips and breakcore. Hardened Frusciante fans might also remember him tinkering with these elements on some earlier solo ventures, like his 2012 record  Pbx Funicular Intaglio Zone .    However,  Maya  simply blows any of Frusciante's previous electronic efforts out of the water. He has somehow pulled an IDM-infused jungle record out of his backside that could easily rival any of  Squarepusher 's, which is an enormous feat for a first try. Considering how comfortable Frusciante sounds in his new suit, you'd swear he's been making this kind of jungle for years. Tracks like ""Flying"" and ""Usbrup Pensul"" seem like they've been crafted by the hands of a seasoned veteran, which of course Frusciante is, just not in this sphere.    Those tracks, and many others on  Maya , aren't just rapid-percussion onslaughts either — they're also armed with offbeat, funky breakdowns, which just adds a whole other level to these already weighty songs. Another neat tack that Frusciante employs is the use of bluesy soul vocals. While your face is being battered by drums, left and right, a sweet voice will emerge from the fray, ready to guide you through. On ""Reach Out,"" it even sounds like  Destiny's Child  are the ones on guide duty.    If you're wondering why this album is released under Frusciante's real name and not Trickfinger or some other alias, you won't be alone. The truth is, this sounds nothing like his output as Trickfinger, so it wouldn't really make sense, but there's a more personal reason too.

2020-10-20,Daniel Sylvester,8,"ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Actress Nimbly Balances Many Ideas, Moods and Collaborators on 'Karma & Desire'",,"There was reason to worry when Darren Cunningham (a.k.a  Actress ) released  88 , his 48-minute mixtape, this past July. Consisting of a fluid jumble of warbling, drifting instrumentals broken into 22 pieces, the only beacon of hope came from the accompanying PDF that promised more new music from before year's end. The album in question,  Karma & Desire , shows that the Wolverhampton musician isn't actually bereft of ideas after all.    Over 17 tracks and 68 minutes, Actress runs the creative gamut, allowing a bevy of sounds, moods, themes and collaborations to help shape his sixth proper album. Not only does Cunningham use excellent guest vocalists across the LP — including folk/pop singer-songwriter  Zsela , LA trance producer (and occasional  John Frusciante  collaborator) Aura T-09 and London electronic soul musician  Sampha  — he makes great use of their contrasting styles, often grouping artists together to create multiple suites across the album.    Darren adds interstitials to bridge the more structured tracks, but these straightforward ambient instrumentals still manage to exude personality and mood, as the album sets the tone with an alien pair of breathy speak-sing tracks featuring Zsela (""Angels Pharmacy"" and ""Remembrance""), while the hazy meditation of ""Glided Squares"" almost works as an intro to the eight-minute haunted piano of the Sampha-assisted ""Many Seas, Many Rivers.""    Despite the thumping four-on-the-floor beats that mostly take over the bottom third of the LP, including the dancefloor-lite ""Loveless"" and ""Turin"" (both featuring Aura T-09) and the wiggly ""Loose"" (featuring Christel Well),  Karma & Desire  never comes close to being a dance record — it's much too opaque and fragile and weird for that. Instead, listeners are left with a longform thinkpiece that's expertly conceived, well executed and brilliantly sequenced.

2020-10-20,Francis Baptiste,8,"POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Sam Lynch Finds Sturdy Footing in an Unsteady World on 'Little Disappearance',,"Sam Lynch 's delicate, lilting voice is achingly melancholy and relatable. There's an underlying sense that whatever the Vancouver-based singer-songwriter is going through, you've gone through it too, and that potential shared emotional experience is endlessly endearing. It can bring the listener back to life's moments of isolation, self-doubt, and confusion. As daunting as that sounds, there's solace and comfort in going back to those places with a guide like Lynch. And that she captures those murky waters so crystalline makes the journey ever more cathartic.     On ""Not My Body,"" the opening track to her debut album,  Little Disappearance , Lynch sings about the experience of disappearing from one's self. The soothing layers that kick off the album lay a silky foundation for Lynch's sage-like voice to ponder the pangs of losing one's sense of self. Yet the song, like many others on this album, builds to a hopeful and lustral crescendo. On ""Off the Rails,"" Lynch shows her ability to approach heavy, stigmatized subjects with tact. While the song is about medicating potential mental illness, it does so in the comfort of a mildly bouncy, playful tone.    In  Little Disappearance 's seven tracks, Lynch expertly controls the cadence and quiet swell of her meditative style of songwriting.  Little Disappearance  is an album about looking for sturdy footing in an unsteady world; it's about losing and finding yourself, letting go and growing. Lynch has a talent for recognizing the powerful moments in her life and turning them into powerful moments of music, and  Little Disappearance  demonstrates that in spades.

2020-10-20,Daryl Keating,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Autechre Are as Accessible as They Can Possibly Get on 'SIGN',,"Even as a die-hard fan, listening to an  Autechre  album can sometimes be a daunting task. You have to be prepared to witness a shapeshifting vessel assemble, launch into hyper-speed with a refractory new turbine engine, land on some mechanical planet, and then have its inner workings disseminated — turns out it's human after all. This all sounds like a feature film, and some previous Autechre records clock in at about the same length:  Exai  is 120 minutes, the 5 parts of  elseq  total over four hours, and those  NTS Sessions  from 2018 are the equivalent of a full work shift.    So, it's not too much of stretch to assume that their latest undertaking would be something gargantuan, but it's not at all.  SIGN  has a reasonable 11 tracks, all of which are a fairly standard length (each around six minutes). In terms of sonics, they've opened things up a bit too. There isn't as much need to sift through the floating detritus of rusty girders and frayed wires to reach that bright shining core. Don't get us wrong, we love the detritus — it's what makes Autechre the incredible act that they are — but it can sometimes be a mental undertaking to dismantle tracks that are so dense and complex.    Conversely,  SIGN  is mostly stripped back, and kind of beautiful at times. ""gr4"" is the most positive Autechre have sounded in years, the ebb and flow of ""psin AM"" is downright hypnotic, and ""esc desc"" might actually tug at your heart strings. It seems oxymoronic to place the word 'accessible' anywhere near Autechre, but  SIGN  could almost be considered breezy in terms of the duo's back catalogue. It's certainly their version of accessible, at the very least.    While Autechre have largely jettisoned the beats on SIGN, they haven't gone fully ambient either. ""au14"" bubbles with jittery percussion, which is interrupted by sharp shots of laser sounds. ""si00"" also bubbles, but the percussion is more of a consistent pulse that slowly gains speed throughout.     For seasoned fans looking for their next fix of boundary-pushing explorations, this will likely seem a tad pedestrian, but  SIGN  is still an incredible piece of work, even if it's not bending the rules of music production into infinity. Plus, it might allow some new listeners to finally penetrate Autechre's tungsten outer shell, and that's nothing to turn your nose up at.

Success is merited by the friends you make along the way and the skills you teach each other. While some major artists try to mask the countless teams helping them achieve their stardom, this crop of young creatives acknowledge every single person involved in the process.    Being a figurehead of the scene and creator of Helix Tears, Hamilton, ON-based producer  blackwinterwells  provides a platform for rising talent and embraces the scene's many innovators. Every track on her sophomore album,  Stone Ocean , features at least one or two prominent glitchcore artists, representative of a roster of talented young musicians.     Album opener ""algae"" is a euphoric introduction that, despite its short runtime, thoroughly transports listeners to blackwinterwells' idiosyncratic world. Algae is an apt metaphor for this scene; blackwinterwells is the sun and her fans and friends are the photosynthetic creatures that thrive under her warmth. ""crystallize,"" another standout, is an emotional song about something unrequited and the inadequacy it brings. The disjointed delivery and computerized stutters add texture, and the way that the vocal effects unravel as the song progresses reads like a story.    The album closes with ""until i break"" featuring Dolly, who is featured both on the first and last track in a cyber-circle of life. This ever-growing community shows the importance of having fun online and working hard with friends, and the power that emerges through teamwork and positivity.

During this period, Morby and producer Brad Cook worked together from their respective homes to put the finishing touches on  Sundowner , which was previously written during a similar state of seclusion in the singer/songwriter's hometown of Kansas City back in 2017, and later recorded in 2019 at Sonic Ranch by the Texas-Mexico border.    Both of the locations where the album was made — and that sense of isolation — heavily inform the album at its core.  Sundowner , which — as explained by Morby in a press release, refers to someone who ""feels increased melancholy during twilight hours"" — evokes alluring visions of middle American scenery: golden valleys, whooshing rivers, long stretches of empty highway, and the sun setting on a vast pastoral landscape. This imagery paired with Morby's lyrical storytelling, capturing feelings of sorrow and tenderness, make for a heavily pensive record.    Casting aside all the gospel elements and angelic choirs of  Oh My God  for twangy guitars, some drums and organ,  Sundowner  is largely stripped-down and bare — and reminiscent of some of Morby's earlier work. ""Valley,"" the steadily rollicking folk rock tune, stands as a strong opener, and ""Campfire"" builds a mellow melody that breaks down to the crackling sounds of an open fire. The song's lyrics refer to the deaths of  Those Darlins ' Jessi Zazu,  Richard Swift  and  Anthony Bourdain .    Elsewhere, ""Don't Underestimate Midwest American Sun"" slows things down for a sparse and strolling acoustic tune, while ""Wander"" is a short, harmonica-tinged ditty with a catchy hook.     Sundowner 's glow begins to fade in the album's latter half. The final two tracks, the instrumental ""Velvet Highway"" and ""Provisions,"" are pleasant enough, but taper the album off on a muted note. It's a minimalist ending showing that less isn't always more.

While she had already established herself as a powerful vocalist with her debut,  flowering head , she's clearly responded to the praise of music critics by taking her voice to a whole new level and allowing it the room to shine throughout the record.    While Banai's bio refers to her music as being pop, her compositions are noticeably more sophisticated and thoughtful than those common in pop music. Even on its most pop-sounding track, ""Shadow Thoughts,"" there lacks an attention-grabbing hook. That's not meant to be a stab at the track, since this is an album of subtlety and tact. At times throughout the album, Banai's jazz influence is prominent, though the songs stay accessible. At times, as in the two instrumental tracks ""Something Soft"" and ""Timshel,"" it even dips its toes into dream pop.    On tracks like ""Intermittent Heart"" and ""Daunting Dazzler,"" Banai's voice twists and turns expertly, meandering itself into something resembling the crooners of times past. It's hard to pinpoint the high point of her performance, because the quality is so consistent throughout these 12 tracks.    It's also worth noting that Banai persistently employs her skills as a classically trained violinist throughout the album. It adds a layer of musical identity to her sound and a touch of refinement and polish to the whole production.

2020-10-15,Chris Gee,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Gulfer Keep Canada's Math Rock Torch Burning Bright on Self-Titled Album,,"For almost eight years, Montreal's  Gulfer  have been one of the most prominent math rock bands in a genre that has never been well-represented in Canadian music. On their earlier releases, culminating in 2018's underrated  Dog Bless , Gulfer crafted blissful punk-adjacent songs that were among the best of the mid-2010s emo revival. Now, Gulfer's new self-titled album, their third full-length, find the group giving their songs a sense of space allowing their pop hooks to shine through.    ""Heat Wave,"" one of Gulfer's best songs to date, showcases of what the band do best — spritely give-and-go between guitarists Joe Therriault and Vincent Ford with twinkly, tender moments revealing hidden inner thoughts about complex relationships with lines like, ""And I don't wanna walk past your apartment cause you're acting strange in this heat wave."" Lead single ""Forget (Friendly)"" is drenched in moody down-stroked guitar and Ford's passionately flared lead vocals asking, ""You call me up just to talk to me, am I wasting your time?"" Like all great anxiety-driven lyrics, they are most therapeutic when yelled, point blank, over big, loud guitars.    There are still plenty of moments where Gulfer show off their intricate guitar interplay and technical prowess. ""Letters"" is carried by kinetic, playful guitars and Julien Daoust's rapturous drum fills while ""Blurry"" turns on a dime at several points, with wound up guitars elastically volleying between of crackling eruptions and overlapping chains of polyrhythms.    Gulfer's math rock never feels challenging or overwrought — on  Gulfer , the band often pull back and lets their frenzied emotions soak, while everything is held together by bellowing undertones from bassist David Mitchell. Gulfer have channeled their energetic approach towards rejuvenating melodies and lingering, raw feelings and their latest is a truly satisfying embodiment of their most collaborative songwriting effort to date.

Their music, meeting at some offbeat and danceable crossroad between noise, industrial and electronic rock, pulls threads of beauty through raucous worlds.    Three-quarters of the tracks on the Los Angeles outfit's newest collaborative LP,  DISCO4 :: PART I , have been released as singles over time since late 2017. But one of the most striking things about this collection is how skillfully HEALTH fit disparate artists into such a cohesive package.     Take, for instance, the skittering beats and floating melodies of ""MASS GRAVE"" that are accented by the interplay and harmonies between  Soccer Mommy  bandleader Sophie Allison's and HEALTH vocalist Jake Duzsik's euphonic deliveries, or  JPEGMAFIA  spitting menacing verses over eerie rhythms and atmospherics on ""HATE YOU."" There's also the  100 gecs -accompanied ""POWER FANTASY,"" a noisy industrial EDM mashup that builds and pounds to a brief lull before dropping into a squelching chiptune breakdown before transitioning again into high-pitched vocals and punishing electronics.    If mid-album number ""FULL OF HEALTH"" with extreme metal mutants  Full of Hell  attempts to rip the earth open to swallow the listener up, the following track ""COLORS,"" with  the Soft Moon , is their walk through the netherworld. ""DELICIOUS APE,"" the album's  Xiu Xiu -featuring longest song, has a dreamy and beautiful spaciousness to it. But the song ripples with a sense of unease that finds its way near the end as it lifts off and blasts forward before crash landing in some mournful realm.    With only one of the twelve tracks, throbbing and glistening opener ""CYBERPUNK 2.0.2.0."" being attributed exclusively to HEALTH,  DISCO4 :: PART I  is a wild and mesmerizing experience.

This is important in understanding the sound of  Kaigo Kioku Kyoku , the debut album by her grandson,  Hiroki Tanaka .    A garden is a marker of someone who takes pride in their home, yet it involves dirt and rain, and, like life, is messy and beautiful.  Kaigo Kioku Kyoku  is an impossibly intricate garden of sound springing from meditations on life and, in particular, death in all its messiness. The album is built around Tanaka's reflections on caring for an uncle with terminal cancer as well as for Goring as she experienced Alzheimer's disease.    Tanaka is best-known for having been the lead guitarist in art rockers  Yamantaka // Sonic Titan , who theatrically blend Asian, European and Indigenous art forms. In full scale, Yamantaka // Sonic Titan are a performance art ensemble who scale down to a rock band for touring purposes. While  Kaigo Kioku Kyoku  seems to be even smaller scale, it is actually the fertile ground for something far grander than its initial quiet folk sound might suggest.    Theatrical elements are present in  Kaigo Kioku Kyoku , as well as Japanese folk hymns, field recordings, spoken word poetry, and a solo harp rendition of the hymn ""Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence,"" performed by Jacqueline Goring (Tanaka's aunt and Kathleen's daughter). The house in which Tanaka took care of Kathleen was also the house Tanaka was born in. The percussion in ""Blue Eyed Doll"" is created from found objects in that house.    In ""Snowdrops,"" a 10 minute piece that combines experimental, folk, and spoken word, featuring a  reading of Tony Hoagland's poem ""I Have Good News"" and an interview with Goring on reminiscences of life and meditations on the meaning of life, she concludes by talking about how each snowdrop has a tiny source of heat that allows it to push through the frozen ground.    It seems a metaphor for the album: Tanaka's art carries him through a difficult chapter of his life.

2020-10-15,Adam Feibel,7,"REVIEWS,MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM",The National's Matt Berninger Sets Aside His Indie Cred on Solo Debut 'Serpentine Prison',,"A year after  the National  released their eighth album,  I Am Easy to Find ,  two of their members are back in the spotlight again with high-profile side-projects. While guitarist  Aaron Dessner  gained widespread attention and acclaim for producing and co-writing much of  Taylor Swift 's  folklore , singer  Matt Berninger  has struck out on his own for an admirably made debut solo album.     Serpentine Prison  draws on previously untapped influences and songwriting styles without venturing all too far from what Berninger has done for years. Produced by the legendary  Booker T. Jones , the album takes a more classic approach than the modern indie rock of the National. It evokes the timeless feel of the family's old record collection: fond memories of listening to anything from  Willie Nelson  to the Gershwins to  Marvin Gaye  to  Olivia Newton-John  to  the Smiths . But  Serpentine Prison  doesn't feel dated; it's just a record that already feels worn-in.    You might hear the harmonically rich finger-picked acoustic guitar on ""Oh Dearie"" and think of Kansas' ""Dust in the Wind."" The uptempo yet subdued ""One More Second"" bears the teensiest resemblance to Howie Day's ""Collide,"" spruced up with the rhythmic, sexed-up melodies and soulful Hammond organ you'd find in a Motown tune. ""Loved So Little"" sounds like  Nick Cave  after a night of bourbon and cigarettes at an Old West saloon. Meanwhile, the piano waltz of ""Take Me Out to Town"" sounds like it could've made it onto  Trouble Will Find Me .    ""Distant Axis"" is an excellent single (co-written by  the Walkmen 's  Walter Martin ) that brings to mind  Phoebe Bridgers , with whom Berninger collaborated for the  Between Two Ferns  movie . ""Collar of Your Shirt"" is a lovely ballad with a marvellously warm and listenable arrangement. The swinging soul of ""Silver Springs"" benefits greatly from Jones' musical prowess, as well as the smooth, satiny vocals of Gail Ann Dorsey. Berninger's voice is as deep and rich as always, but his lyrics are more straightforward and easier to interpret than the melancholy abstraction he brings to the National; it's yet another reason for  Serpentine Prison  to find broader appeal.    With this solo venture, Berninger's most likely audience — outside of the National fans, of course — might be among the type of mass audience that has previously gobbled up adult-contemporary products like  Coldplay , the Fray,  Matchbox Twenty  and  Vance Joy . Dessner brought his indie cred into the modern pop mainstream with Swift; Berninger decided to set his aside. For a solo debut,  Serpentine Prison  seems like a natural first step and a safe bet for both the artist's individual ambitions and the comfort of existing fans.

2020-10-16,Jordan Currie,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC,POP AND ROCK",Leith Ross Turns Vulnerable Songs into Universal Sentiments on 'Motherwell',,"The eight songs that make up  Leith Ross ' debut EP were recorded in one afternoon, but it's a body of work that doesn't feel rushed in the slightest. In fact,  Motherwell  oozes with contemplation, taking its time in telling an amalgamation of years' worth of memories associated with the aching growing pains of getting older.    Ross, a 21-year-old graduate of Humber College, teamed up with their fellow classmates to record the songs live off the floor. Drawing inspiration from singer-songwriters like  Phoebe Bridgers  and  Feist , Ross has crafted a debut full of fear and hope that will resonate with people going through the same transitional periods of life.    Motherwell reads like a series of melancholic diary entries, but with buoyancy rather than dragging the listener down. The feather-light vocals on ""Grown Up"" lulls about the confrontation of getting older. On ""Prayer,"" Ross discusses being faithless but wishing they weren't, backed up by a metronome-like strumming guitar. ""Tommy"" is a tribute to Ross' grandfather and how the memories you carry of people can impact you forever. The phrase ""wise beyond their years"" implies that young people don't experience the world as deeply or intellectually as older people, but the wisdom that Ross applies to their music pierces on each song.    ""Coming Back"" is a piano-led conclusion to the guitar-driven collection. It's languid and dreamlike, fitting for a song that mentions sleep frequently. ""I used to talk to my mother about how I just couldn't wait to get old,"" Ross croons, and, just like that, the listener is catapulted back to the hopefulness of childhood.    Ultimately,  Motherwell  is a simple debut with a universal premise that may not be groundbreaking. It's Ross's penmanship and vulnerability, however, that make it an EP that can be listened to at any age and be a reminder of the fear and beauty of growing up.

While the band's reference points are evident, their seamlessly rendered eclecticism makes for a transcendent sound, a modish blend with the potential to win over a variety of listeners.    Following the opening track's instrumental cacophonies and tuneful breaks, tracks two through five of  Shades  unfold as pop gems, featuring buoyant melodies, exultant guitar-and-bass lines and horn-plus-synth noise interludes courtesy of CJ Calderwood. Raisa Khan's vocal is immediately and sustainedly compelling, her delivery, like that of  Broadcast 's Trish Keenan, paradoxically cerebral and visceral, detached and vulnerable, automatonic and seductive.    ""This Skin"" is driven by a repetitive yet riveting guitar riff that conjures side B of  Nevermind . Calderwood's ambient flourishes appear and disappear, a tribute, perhaps, to  John Coltrane 's and  Ornette Coleman 's free jazz ventures. Khan's delivery, a droll mix of singing and speaking, may remind some listeners of  Dream Wife 's Rakel Mjöll. On ""Reaching,"" Khan's vocal rises from a welter of distorted guitars, bass, and drums that brings to mind early  Sleater-Kinney . ""Bubble"" is a return to avant-pop virtuosity. ""Keep looking without / keep looking within you,"" Khan sings, juxtaposing New Age-ism and the satirical nihilism of neo-punk.    ""It's snowing in August / and it's sunny at Christmas,"" Khan sings on the title song, a tongue-in-cheek stoner pop anthem about global warming. ""Taking"" is a jab at the Western world's dependency on pharmaceuticals: ""This pill's for my blood / This pill's for my heart / This pill's for my trust / This one's for luck."" The driving riff in ""Universal"" reinterprets Kurt Cobain's guitar part from  Incesticide 's ""Dive,"" the song an apt closer, integrating noise, an impeccable melody, experimental instrumentation and Khan's grounded/grounding vocal.     Shades  spotlights a band with diverse influences and the ability to cogently and cohesively re-contextualize them. Additionally, the album features one infectious melody after another, Raisa Khan emerging as one of the more intriguing voices of her generation.

2020-10-16,Oliver Crook,6,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Ian Daniel Kehoe's '80s Throwback Is a Little Too Accurate on 'Rock & Roll Illusion',,"Ian Daniel Kehoe 's music has always felt like a throwback. The multi-instrumentalist — known as a former member of  Attack in Black  and the drummer for  Andy Shauf  and  the Weather Station  — released his mournful pop album  Secret Republic  just last year. Now, he's back with the official release of  Rock & Roll Illusion  — an album he dropped on Bandcamp as part of a  trio of releases in August .    The other two Bandcamp records are completely different:  Disco Body Buzz  is, yep, disco, while  Charging the Stone  has an alt-country feel.  Rock & Roll Illusion , on the other hand, feels like a mellowed out  Eddie Money  album.    Everything about it is '80s arena synth-rock. From the cover art's aviators and tussled hair to the distorted, airy guitars, it's an ode that borders on mimicry. This is not a comment on the quality of the music — if the record had come out in 1983, like it should have, it would have rivalled Bob Seger and John Mellancamp. Rather, it's an acknowledgement that Kehoe hasn't attempted to mess with the form at all.    Tracks such as ""Bye Bye Innocence"" and ""Deja Vu"" come complete with the cheesy synths and stuttering guitars that encapsulate the era. Kehoe has that soft affectation which brings back memories of ""Summer of '69,"" but without the heart-tugging emotion.    Therein lies the problem with this record: Kehoe is chasing an illusion, a ghost of a bygone era that can't be recreated — even by those who were there.    All of this gives a strange sense of knowing the songs on first listen, making it feel tiresome over eight songs.

2020-10-16,Ryley Remedios,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",beabadoobee's Rock Star Dreams Become Reality on 'Fake It Flowers',,"With a dedicated Gen-Z fanbase,  beabadoobee  — the moniker of musician Bea Kristi — has become a household name to fans of bedroom pop playlists and viral TikTok videos.  Fake It Flowers , her debut full-length album, aims to blur the genre barrier between '90s garage rock and lo-fi pop, finding her on the cusp of breaking into mainstream radio while remaining a budding rock star in her own right.    Fuelled by her love for Britpop, the album carries a deep nostalgia for that era of grunge, chipped vinyl and vintage threads. The songs sound like they were recorded while rocking out with her friends in the garage with a no-fucks-given attitude toward music — and it works.    There are the fuzzy standout hits like ""Care"" and ""Sorry,"" about childhood trauma and the masochism of her past. She channels all her teenage angst through broken patch cords, giving her sweet demeanour a jagged edge, drawing from her tumultuous journey from being expelled from high school to teaching herself how to play guitar via YouTube tutorials to signing a record deal with  the 1975 's label, Dirty Hit.    She takes a feminine stance on ""Dye It Red,"" then puts her angst on overdrive with ""Charlie Brown,"" which is the farthest thing from her lo-fi comfort zone. There is some pretty guitar picking on ""Back to Mars,"" while the delicate string arrangements on ""Horen Sarrison"" underscore the sweet love song to her boyfriend and collaborator, Soren Harrison. (""You are the sun that I need for my mental state / Convinced you're from outer space."")     Although there are messy guitar techniques and screeching slides all over the record, Kristi hones her craft on ""How Was Your Day"" with careful lyrics and a contemplative sound. And then just when you think she's embracing peace and quiet, she kicks off album closer ""Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene"" with a fart joke before hurling right into a fun track that showcases how her anthemic rock star dreams have become her new reality.    Kristi has embraced the cliché that she was born in the wrong generation, wishing she lived in the '90s. With bleached hair, butterfly clips and brutally honest lyrics, she is unapologetically herself, and encourages others to do the same. She is loud and thoughtful. The melodies are flirty and messy.  Fake It Flowers  is an album made to play with guts and grit. At such a young age, Kristi knows herself extremely well, yet is mindful enough to give up only so much of herself to this strong collection of songs.

""Called Out Your Name"" opens the project with an unapologetic aplomb that sets the scene for an emotionally testing, but fun, country-rock road trip. The lively ""Paper Thin Walls"" is reminiscent of a darker ""No Hurry,"" and is the sort of single you can expect from Lightfoot — chock-full of sunny guitar riffs, crashing drums, but with the raw lyrics of a relationship on the edge. Lightfoot dips even further into heaviness on ""Empty House,"" where the artist bemoans her dependency and loss of identity during a partnership: ""When you're gone, I'm up for rent / I am an empty house again / When you're gone, I've got nothing left.""    While the album is familiar in all the ways that make Lightfoot's Americana sound so loveable, there's a sense of familiarity at the centre of  Consider the Speed . ""Love You So,"" ""Midnight Choir,"" and ""Ramblin' Rose"" act as a form of sonic déjà vu, and they disappear amongst the raging guitars and roaring vocals on the piece's stronger tracks. Country-rock clichés make unfortunate appearances — imagery rife with pickup trucks, wild horses and long drives down deserted roads. Although flawless production and Lightfoot's effervescent vocal performances keep the tracks enjoyable, the laundry list of overworked themes get tiresome after the first listen. However, Lightfoot makes up for it by crafting honest and relatable stories about love and loss.    Thanks to Lightfoot's songwriting strengths,  Consider the Speed  stands as the most emotionally developed project from the Hamilton singer-songwriter so far.

Reminiscent of 2013's  Vapor City , Stewart's latest album succeeds in capturing the same smooth pace and genre-bending magic but enmeshed with new blood thanks to some impressive collaborations.       Featuring  Sub Focus ,  Chrome Sparks ,  Father ,  Freddie Gibbs ,  Mono/Poly , Tigran Hamasyan, Jesse Boykins III,  Rochelle Jordan  and Tanerélle,  A View of U  sees Stewart distill a number of different styles and musical influences ⏤ from Armenian jazz to American hip hop ⏤ into a carefully crafted electronic cocktail. His ability to fuse various sounds, melodies, vocals and tempos to his liking shines bright; drum and bass, hip hop, IDM, rave, dance, jungle and more fall into line with an ease that only the North Carolina-born producer can manage.     A View of U  is a grandiose, expansive and starry-eyed journey that sits comfortably in its suspension of belief. With meditation as the inspiration, it's no surprise that Stewart begets meditative music. Highlights include Gibbs' bombastic swagger on ""Kane Train"" and Sub Focus' drum and bass seduction on ""1000 Miles"". Machinedrum's latest venture is out of this world, so to speak, and it's a much welcome addition to the veteran's venerated discography.

However, its sound is far harder to pin down.    Jeen O'Brien has been known to collaborate with others who are thought to have defined a Canadian sound, whatever that may be, but her work steers clear of any sort of national mythology. This is not her first collaboration with Canning; they play together in  Cookie Duster . Other Canadian musical influencers she has collaborated with include  Serena Ryder  and  Hawksley Workman . Jeen also welcomed Great Big Sea in the oddly mesmerizing ""Everywhere I Go"" on her 2015 album,  Tourist  — she was backed by their haunting harmony, stripped of its usual rousing folksiness.    One thing that is to be expected, this most recent album brings both sounds of the '90s and early 2000s, with Jeen's sweet and strong vocals reminiscent of  Neko Case . Blurton's skilled guitar playing is rounded out by Canning's upbeat bass and O'Brien's brother, Ben. Jeff Heisholt joins them on synth, Kevin Fox handles cello, and Stephan Szczeniak provides the drums. Even with a fairly small lineup, the mishmash of sound hearkens to the ""collective"" ensembles prominent in the early 2000s — of which Canning's  Broken Social Scene  is a prototype.    The catchy, upbeat ""Deep End"" is, as stated by Jeen, about smiling when you feel like shit. ""Slow and Low,"" is a  Beastie Boys  cover (by way of  Run-DMC ). Both earlier versions have the same punchy, angsty sound, but Jeen's is smooth and cool. Actually, Jeen's vocals seem always smooth and cool. But knowing the original version of ""Slow and Low"" makes one wonder what kind of angst is lurking just a little bit deeper in the layers of her other songs, as well.    Women are often told to smile — though, of course, there is more complexity to the identity lurking behind the veneer. The most spacey-sounding ""Anything You Want"" is about being true to your path and not the ones others choose for you. The sound on Jeen's self-titled album conveys the period of suspension as you search for that path.

2020-10-08,Angela Morrison,7,"MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS",Bahamas' 'Sad Hunk' Lives Up to Its Name,,"""Is there some trick to being happy?"" asks  Bahamas  (a.k.a. Afie Jurvanen) on ""Trick to Happy,"" the opening track on  Sad Hunk , his fifth full-length album since 2009's  Pink Strat . This question seems to animate the album, filled to the brim with chilled-out meditations on domesticity, marriage, making a living as a musician, and navigating the contours of being ""cool."" Perhaps such existential questions are natural given that Jurvanen and his family recently relocated from Toronto to a quiet town on the coast of Nova Scotia.    Despite his change in scenery,  Sad Hunk  features Jurvanen's regular collaborators (Don Kerr, Felicity Williams, Christine Bougie and Mike O'Brien) along with new addition Sam Weber on guitar — musicians whose gentle, precise playing combines perfectly with Jurvanen's laid-back energy. Their prior LP, 2018's  Earthtones  pushed the band in new, unexpected directions in their collaborations with James Gadson and Pino Palladino, the legendary rhythm section from  D'Angelo 's  Black Messiah  (2014). Here, they return to their trademark soulful indie folk, a sound that is easily recognizable yet never formulaic.     Sad Hunk  is perhaps the perfect title for this record, encapsulating Jurvanen's sweetness and sense of humour (""I'm not looking for another wife / I'm just looking at you, babe"") as well as his melancholic edge and thoughtful nature. The album's first single, ""Own Alone,"" is a shuffling, almost frantic groove on which Jurvanen proposes a toast to ""cold and broken, lonely me,"" proclaiming himself ""Too old to understand that selfie / Too far gone for you to help me."" Jurvanen alternates between lighthearted and ponderous on songs such as the twangy ""Done Did Me No Good"" and ""Up With the Jones,"" a plucky tune punctuated by handclaps and guitar tones that evoke  Fleetwood Mac .    A running lyrical theme throughout, perhaps related to the question asked in ""Trick to Happiness,"" is the value of economic security and cultural capital, touched upon in ""Own Alone"" (""Too broke to feel so wealthy"") and ""Not Cool Anymore,"" and directly addressed in both ""Can't Complain"" and ""Fair Share."" The latter two songs trace Jurvanen's feelings toward his career as a successful musician with Bahamas, wherein he expresses gratitude for being able to make a living with his art but asserts his wish to avoid a ""bad deal with Warner"" and symbols of wealth such as pension plans and private schools. Williams' lovely, gentle backing vocals provide a perfect counterpart to Jurvanen in the bluesy ""Fair Share,"" in which Jurvanen offers advice to young musicians, in turn prompting him to ask the question, ""Where does all of that leave me?""    The questions posed throughout  Sad Hunk  are perhaps unanswerable, yet reflect Jurvanen's deceptively complex, philosophical lyricism. Unassuming yet laid-back and confident, Bahamas have quickly become one of Canada's most beloved folk staples, as evidenced by a multitude of JUNO Awards and nominations.  Sad Hunk  captures the band's lively chemistry, proving that five albums in, Jurvanen and company are still finding ways to make ""something new for all of you with some old refrain.""

2020-10-08,Luke Pearson,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Mat Zo Gives the 'Illusion of Depth' with Turn-of-the-Millennium Electronic Sounds,,"After two successful albums — 2013's  Damage Control  even earned a Grammy nomination — London DJ/producer  Mat Zo  has returned with  Illusion of Depth , an energetic and (as usual) stylistically eclectic tour, this time through the landscape of late '90s and early '00s electronic music. There's dancehall-inflected big-beat in the vein of  Groove Armada ,  Daft Punk -style disco-funk, and lots of  Chemical Brothers  worship (some embarrassingly devout) — all held together with Zo's steady hand.    This variety definitely keeps things feeling fresh, but there's also a tendency here to indulge too heavily in some of the aspects of these styles that caused them to fall out of favour in the first place — press material kindly describes the style as ""brash,"" but ""obnoxious"" would be more accurate. Zo's instincts navigating this era are otherwise good though, and the pleasant surprises on  Illusion of Depth  ultimately outweigh the missteps.    That said, he doesn't exactly put his best foot forward, opening the album ""In Media Res,"" a tiresome exercise in pounding beats and drawn-out buildups that never lead to anything worthwhile. Zo unfortunately has a real soft spot for uninspired  Fatboy Slim -style builds like this, the kind where you can tell after the first half-second how he's going to handle the next 30.    No one looms more largely over the album than the Chemical Brothers however — especially on ""Problems,"" which mimics the style, structure, production and instrumentation of the Brothers' ""Out of Control"" (track three from 1999's  Surrender , look it up) so closely your eyes will bug out. Zo nails it often enough, however, distilling the swaggering attitude of the period well on driving cuts like ""The Next Chapter"" and ""Petrushka"" for instance, both of which wind and pulse with a late '90s,  Wipeout XL -type energy; cool stuff.    Also successful are the moments when Zo reverts to what is arguably his signature style — the glitched out, starry-eyed EDM of the early 2010s that he helped popularize with the likes of  Porter Robinson  and  Zedd , a style he's on record saying he tried to explicitly distance himself from here. Fair enough, but late album highlights ""Dangerous Feeling"" (a revisiting of the euphoric palette from ""Easy,"" the cut that helped earn him his Grammy nod on  Damage Control ), and the blissed-out ""Colours"", which sounds like a long-lost gem from one of your old Ministry of Sound comps, threaten to steal the show from all the heavy-handed, big-beat bluster that precedes them.    Zo manages to keep his feet in two separate eras fairly successfully here, and if  Illusion of Depth  is a bit of a mixed bag, it at least means you're more likely than not to find something you like in it.

Her self-titled debut album, intended as a state of reflection for dealing with complex emotions, is powered by vocals that echo and swirl atop atmospheric and at times sparse instrumentation.    In the opening track, ""Feeling,"" a happy beat is a soft bed in which the words ""maybe just a little bit sad"" are repeated with juxtaposition over and over, getting into the listeners' head but playfully rather than irritably. ""Go in the Morning"" is hypnotically uplifting, the lyrics simple but sung operatically and with motivational purpose. ""Go in the morning to the highest place that you can find and walk around,"" she recommends, as though starting the day with a sense of power is the best way to deal with emotions.    The hypnotic quality is a theme throughout. In ""I'll Buy You Lunch,"" a rapid but bare beat sets a pace for Linaire's vocals, which sing the same lines over and over, unthreateningly and pronounced. Towards the end, these vocals are layered with a slight delay — an effect that's central to ""Oh Who,"" where the vocals vary in pitch and become a little chaotic. ""There has never been a clearer path to you / The sidewards baseball cap and plastic jewels,"" she states, while a violin reminiscent of a car alarm is set off midway through. The multiple voices, all proclaiming the same thing, gives the impression of being lost inside one's own thoughts.    As an album sonically exploring beauty and discomfort, many of the songs are wrapped in an illuminated darkness — melancholic but glittery. ""The Inside, the Outside"" is one of these, as is ""Best I Can."" With the operatic vocals and hint of whimsicality, the album recalls Norwegian artist Susanne Sunfør, as emphasized by closing track ""Long Long Line,"" which glides along like a plane approaching a landing in a city at night.    ""Worked That Way"" perhaps best sums up the album. Beginning a cappella, a twinkling melody enters, creating a slight otherworldliness and dreaminess. It's subtly melancholic orchestral additions are incorporated into the electronics to maintain a sense of playfulness. Lyrics from ""Oh Who"" are repeated again, merging the songs so they are all part of one entity.    Having established a career in the music industry, with two solo albums and a multitude of projects within theatre, film and dance, Atkinson taking on the role as Linaire comes fully-formed and conceptualized. The self-titled album is accessible, intriguing, and a simple exploration of what can be done with instrumentation and voice.

Gargoyl 's self-titled debut album succeeds in this task by taking its listeners on a emotional rollercoaster that is full of sonic twists and turns. Luke Roberts and company have created a sonically unnerving masterpiece that is the perfect soundtrack for our times.    In a field of music that often prides itself on becoming further and further dissonant, Gargoyl thrive in finding melody through unorthodox means. Frontman Luke Roberts is able to weave Layne Staley-style vocal patterns in ways that almost seem impossible. Take the song ""Waltz Dystopia"" for example; instrumentally, the song becomes more and disorienting and dissonant while the vocals become more melodic. It is this juxtaposition throughout the album that makes Gargoyl stand out amongst others.    Gargoyl's album builds up to many climactic moments throughout. Whether it is the euphoric chorus on ""Plastic Nothing"" or the mind-bending guitar solo on ""Nightmare Conspiracy,"" Gargoyl have the kind of contrast that works to constantly demand the listener's attention throughout. Just when you think you have the record figured out, Gargoyl offer you another nuance to consider.    Gargoyl have truly created a metal album to be excited about. The combination of  Alice in Chains  grunge mixed with modern progressive metal yields an album unlike any other this year. For a record that brings back the kind of youthful excitement one has upon discovering metal for the first time,  Gargoyl  is an experience unlike any other.

With Avina's spacious soundscapes, the 11 tracks of new album  Unearth  possess a beautiful flow, as one would expect from minimalist folk.    On  Unearth , Avina digs deep into the emotional well, unafraid of what she might discover, her introspection hopefully leading to growth. It's perhaps why the lyricism is so stark and sparse; there is clear restraint, the emotions still raw and unexplored. The opening song ""Cups"" considers the challenges of communication in a relationship: ""You can say what you want to but that won't make you listen,"" Avina sings with weary conviction. On the tender ballad ""Inner Garden"", she quietly hopes that, ""In time, we'll start to see eye to eye.""    Avina's voice flits between ethereal vulnerability and striking determinism. The aching yearning of ""Fit Into"" sees Avina lower her defences as she ponders changing herself to satisfy another (""Fit into him / I wanna try / I wanna try / I wanna glow""); as the momentous ""Night Sky"" brings the record to a close, she sounds more confident and free of doubt.    Given the sparseness of the words, the album lives in its instrumentation. The tender guitar patterns and silvery cymbals create a safe cocoon for Avina's thoughtful introspection to flourish at its own pace. The four lines of ""Feeding That Beast"" are perhaps the most encapsulating of the messiness of relationships: ""Feeding that beast / I wouldn't know / And when I held him / I thought I was holding gold""; as the writer David Foster Wallace put it, ""How odd I can have all this inside me and to you it's just words.""

He's done time in Vancouver punks Reserve 34, Seattle metal outfit  Black Breath  and San Francisco dream-pop crew  Modern Charms , to name but a few. His musical transience appears matched only by an apparent constant need to keep moving.    Perhaps the one constant has been a dedication to songcraft which he brings to the fore most prominently in his newest project,  Supercrush . Worshipping at the feet of fuzzed-out '90s power pop icons like  Teenage Fanclub ,  the Posies  and  Velvet Crush , the band are a throwback in almost every way possible. The songs are short, punchy and filled with beautiful vocal harmonies about love and heartache.    Yet at no point do Palm and his bandmates, including  Shook Ones ' Phil Jones, who also co-produced, feel like they're trying to just recreate the past. Rather, the songs on full-length debut  SODO Pop  — last year's  Never Let You Drift Away  was mostly a collection of singles — feel like a continuation, a passing of the baton. Palm is using the sounds of yesterday to explore his current point of view.    From the slow-burn jangle of ""I Didn't Know (We Were Saying Goodbye)"" to the shoegaze-y blur of ""Parallel Lines,"" the familiarity of these 10 tracks is like an itch you can't quite scratch; a hook, a melody, even a guitar tone so familiar, yet you can't quite place from where.    In this sense, their closest analogue is probably  Beach Slang , a group similarly fronted by a DIY lifer (James Alex) using old sounds to excise current fixations. Palm hasn't quite reached Alex's sublime amalgam of the new and the old. But  SODO Pop  has enough idiosyncrasies to push past its influences and be embraced on its own terms.

With this album,  Mav Karlo  offers up an instant classic of an album, studded through and through with gems. With the album's soft sound and incisive lyrics, Mav Karlo will make you feel less lonely.    Mav Karlo, with its fodder-for-folklore beginnings, is the solo project of former  Hollerado  frontman Menno Versteeg. While the project's  Reno Tapes  from earlier this year was a pared down and meandering EP,  Strangers Like Us , Mav Karlo's debut full-length album, is brassier, with catchy choruses that'll stay with you for days.  Katy Goodman  (of  Vivian Girls ) provides backing vocals, and her voice is an interesting complement to Versteeg's, adding delicate texture as it beautifully echoes choruses and carries melodies.  Dizzy 's Charlie Spencer is on keyboard and drums (and it shows, in a good way), and ex-Hollerado bandmate Nixon Boyd is on guitar and bass. Chris Coady ( Beach House ,  Grizzly Bear ) produced the album.    Versteeg's voice has always been distinct. Here, however, it's honeyed and soothing, inquisitive sometimes as it negotiates with an unseen force. He has always excelled as a lyricist and storyteller. On  Strangers Like Us , his words steal the show on track after track — from the heartbreakingly nostalgic romp through Honest Ed's that is ""Dig a Hole"" (""Dust-covered clues to the tastebuds of simpler days"" is the most perfect thing I've heard all year) to the anthemic, plaintive cry of ""Treasure"" and the grittiness of  ""Detonator""  (""So embarrassed by my behaviour I had to pretend not to care"").    There's nothing overwrought about this album; it's simple and safe, and this is why it's so effective. It makes no grandiose claims. The words focus on deeply idiosyncratic and lonely impressions, on microcosms gravitating around and within Versteeg, but they tap into something so deeply human that you see yourself in Versteeg's place. The tracks are like parables that, while telling Versteeg's stories, serve in turn as advice and as cautionary tales to listeners. Mourning a city lost, hoping for a safe individual and collective future, hoping for a stable mind, for bravery, the album speaks to a desire we all have: to be okay. He tells gritty stories — sometimes with a wily sense of humour, other times with grim realness — of a life deeply felt. And these stories are couched in a sound that isn't overbearing and that never overshadows Versteeg's or Goodman's voices — all components intersect stunningly. (Hats off to Coady.)    Versteeg has stated that writing this album served a therapeutic function for him, but listening to it is also deeply healing. You're left feeling as though you're not the only one in pain, mired in confusion, or blinded by anger. Not so much a rallying cry as a reassuring hand on our shoulders,  Strangers Like Us  is a relatable and beautiful debut from Mav Karlo, artist of the people. After all, its title is effectively ""us.""

On her previous two records released under her own name — 2014's  Pink City  and 2018's  Angels of Death  — Castle sings of nature, love, death and their interwoven beauty. On her new record,  Monarch Season , Castle returns to these themes, but this time she performs her songs in a minimalist setting. Her messages, in turn, feel louder, even though you will find yourself instinctively leaning in to catch every moment.      Primarily recorded at Castle's home in Port Stanley, ON, with producer Jeff McMurrich,  Monarch Season  is a simple record but it poses big questions: ""Justice, my sister, I need you this very hour. Where are you?"" Castle asks on ""Justice."" On ""Broken Hearted,"" she asks, ""What becomes of a broken hearted? Will they ever heal? Will they ever love again?"" These questions blossomed under the glow of the moon, a source of wonder and strength for Castle, who, about the album, writes, ""[ Monarch Season ] is a reminder to cherish openly that which reflects off and onto me. A reminder that stone orbs only become meaningful moons when they experience the gravity and light of others.""      Castle is the lone musician on  Monarch Season , playing guitar, piano and harmonica, and the songs thrive in this quiet. On ""NYC,"" Castle distills the din of a busy city into tender blows of a harmonica, and, on ""I'll Never Walk Alone,"" Castle and a roving guitar melody guide you through cavernous anxieties until the absurdity of being alive seems a little more manageable: ""I'll never walk alone or be homeless / My home is forever my bones."" Through the windows that were left open during recording, the sounds of nature flow through  Monarch Season  and cover you. Do you hear the wind? The crickets?      On the album's title track, a goosebump-inducing ballad, Castle traces the flight path of a butterfly with a simple piano melody.

2020-10-14,Joe Bagel,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Helena Deland's 'Someone New' Is a Confetti Cannon Filled with Breakup Roses,,"Like a parcel of breakup roses compressed into a confetti cannon,  Helena Deland 's debut album is explosive, belaboured and totally intoxicating.    After years of feather-flicking her audience with EPs and singles, the Montreal singer-songwriter has finally delivered the goods, with 13 painstakingly arranged songs of elegiac guitar pop, woven together like your comfiest quilt.    Emotionally,  Someone New  is a saturnine affair; it's  Nick Drake  with synthesizers, or  Natalie Prass  with a pout, and while not every song on the album oozes  Elliott Smith  as much as the stripped-down album closer, ""Fill the Rooms,"" Deland has picked up his torch of musical melancholy and sprinted away with it very far indeed — with a caravan of Polaris-truck-chasing PR men in her rose-petalled tow.    Partially produced by close friend Valentin Ignat, as well Gabe Wax ( The War on Drugs ,  Adrianne Lenker ) and Jake Portrait ( Unknown Mortal Orchestra 's bassist, and past studio contributor for  Porches ,  Alex G ,  Whitney ,  DIIV , et al.), Deland makes the most of the indie pop A-team at her disposal: her smoke-sculpted vocals are the eye of the tempest, with textural guitar licks and synths and ad libs and overdubs and occasional strings and judicious drum tracks all working in total subordination to her audacious songwriting vision.      Suavely juking the Spotify-friendly,  Mazzy Star -aspiring waif rock dogpile of her contemporaries, Deland's lyrical style is instead firmly planted in the hardscrabble school of  Liz Phair . Album stand-out ""Lylz,"" a maudlin celebration of female friendship, contains hints of it in wry one-liners (""I've got my driver's license / And you will need to practice"") and bombastic sentimentality (""And if one of us dies / The other will make sure / Her life's work goes down in history""). In ""Dog,"" her vulnerability is evoked in visceral images (""I hate to be your dog / But I got everything to gain from your hand on my head / Like I'm about to be dragged""), but that vulnerability is then delightfully subverted when a tongue-in-cheek Deland goes full husky in the chorus, howling out ""Awoooo.""    Dog 1, boys 0.    Lest one get the wrong impression, Deland has not entirely foregone the pop-friendly filigrees which dazzled us in all her prior singles — ones which seem like rightfully set-aside A/B tests of a voice yearning for its perfect vessel. Deland has clearly found that in  Someone New ; so when she does put her chops on display, especially on a song like ""Mid-Practice,"" the emotional release of the funeral pyre performance is made ever-more-magnificent for the songs that precede it, for the brooding milieu Deland has wrought and lured her listeners inside.     Someone New  is an exploration of heartache, lust, dissatisfaction and resignation to the perennial (and tedious) shittiness of men in her orbit — but it's also about how those feelings of weariness and romantic ambivalence can so quickly knot up with ones of jealousy and longing. There is, of course, no resolution in sight by album's end. But it's in these in-between-spaces where Deland thrives. It's a gestational document, thrilling to witness.    After 13 rounds of it, Deland bows out with a pledge: ""I will fill the room with music"".    When she's done, we'll be screaming ""come back"".

2020-10-01,Scott Roos,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Smokekiller's Satisfyingly Straight-Ahead 'Chiba' Is Begging to Be Turned to 11,,"Chiba , the seven-song opus from Saskatoon indie scene stalwarts  Smokekiller , is a masterclass in straight-ahead, small-venue, plug-in-and-play riff-rock. Musically a strange hodge podge of the folk rock sensibilities of  Paul Westerberg , the vocal aloofness of  Weezer  and the four-on-the-floor anthems of  Foo Fighters , Smokekiller know where their lane is and stay in it for the duration of  Chiba .    Kicking off with the up-tempo, heady, hooky, nostalgia-laden neo-CanRock of ""Feeling Good,"" frontman/guitarist/evil genius  John Antoniuk  clearly knows how to milk a heavy groove to its very fullest. He can also shred a pretty tasteful guitar solo. Throughout each of the seven tracks on  Chiba , Antoniuk's guitar work is evident and, while not a focal point, still adds to the overall vibe and appeal.    Perhaps the most interesting aspect of  Chiba , however, is Anoniuk's innate ability to create tension in his vocal delivery by jumping up an octave or pushing the volume of his voice, creating an emotive strain. He does this on a number of these seven tracks, most memorably on ""Don't Wanna Tell You.""    The devil is in the details when it comes to  Chiba . The simplicity of a lot of the arrangements can be deceptive. The melodic hooks, and Antoniuk's overall use of tension, are the forces that makes  Chiba  such a palatable series of meat-and-potatoes grunge anthems, perfect for listeners who want to crank something to 11 and recount their '90s glory days.

2020-10-01,Tom Piekarski,7,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE",SUMAC Offer Brutal Empathy on Their Art Metal Epic 'May You Be Held',,"SUMAC ask that you interpret their fourth full-length as an expression of care: unconditional care for yourself, for others, and for the world at large. The interpretative task might not be an easy one, as the band is most associated with genres whose musical signifiers do not often call to mind vulnerability, solidarity or empathy. But SUMAC have been a band about love since their inception, and  May You Be Held  is its most unreserved expression of this ideal yet.    That result is indebted to the improvisation on the album. Those paying close attention will note that each consecutive SUMAC offering has increasingly integrated free-form and textural approaches into their otherwise crystalized compositions.  MYBH  is characterized by a rethinking of the band members' musical relationships with each other, especially when untethered to the expectations of musical form.    For instance, album opener ""A Prayer for Your Path"" finds drummer Nick Yacyshyn on bowed vibraphone, a move that reinterprets his role in the band. Where his drumming is often painterly, weaving in and out of the structured solidity that guitar and bass riffs provide, the bowed vibraphone sounds utterly tectonic in his hands. It grounds the fleeting swells and screeches of the rest of the band while calling to mind massive shifts over deep time.    Bassist Brian Cook is well-known for running the tonal gamut, but even he achieves something immaculate on ""The Iron Chair."" Not only does he showcase his breadth of sound, but he does so while blending into the track so as to almost disappear. It's an essential contribution, as ""The Iron Chair"" is without a doubt the album's most potent track. Unlike the two other free-form explorations on  MYBH , it shows that all three musicians are capable of being improvisatory without entirely abandoning the brutality they are best known for. The band achieves perhaps their most ecstatic moment to date about three and a half minutes in, when, after a single second of silence and a five-hit drum fill, Aaron Turner launches the band into a frenzy with the yell of ""a black chair!""         For those not moved by this more unhinged side of the band,  MYBH  may prove disappointing. The kinds of heights previous records achieved by knotting riff after pummeling riff together are scant. In moments when the band members do find themselves coalescing towards a more unified effort, the results are decidedly less heady than on past albums. Indeed, much of the middle third of the title track is about as knuckle-dragging as SUMAC can conceivably get. Still,  MYBH  makes the case that the field recording that plays out album closer ""Laughter and Silence"" is now as integral a part of the Sumac sound as any other. If you're willing to consider a musical choice like that to be just as ""heavy"" as a lurching dirge or a colossal chug, then  May You Be Held  will prove a rewarding and expansive listen.

On 2017 sophomore album  True to Self , Tiller recognized his assimilation into R&B stardom — a position he aspired to but also criticized on  Trapsoul . Here, Tiller's voice is a recognizable return to his essence, sharing his honest but shallow versions of vulnerability.      Anniversary  does not shy away from Tiller's notable flips of cassette tapes and voicemail recordings from an array of displeased women. It also gives listeners a much-hyped Drake collaboration in ""Outta Time."" Despite years of hints at a collaboration between the two, with Tiller having almost signed to Drake's OVO label, the song feels short-lived without a hook.     ""Timeless Interlude"" demonstrates Tiller's growth from the 502 come-up kid to an established artist who has finally acknowledged his place in the game: ""If Jesus take my life? / At least I made it to the greatest heights.""

The album put a spotlight on 21 as a talented lyricist served best on Metro Boomin's specialty — murder music beats.  Savage Mode II  was to be a return to their roots, with the Pen & Pixel-created, '90s-esque album artwork solidifying their intention to create throwback music reminiscent to their earlier works, even if that was just half a decade ago.    Whether they hit the mark with their sequel is debatable. While  Savage Mode II  is by no means a lacklustre album, it may not be the exact product their fans hoped for. Songs like ""No Opp Left Behind"" and ""Glock in My Lap"" are up the right alley, while tunes like ""Said N Done"" and ""RIP Luv"" give the album a softer touch. Unsurprisingly, guest features by  Drake ,  Young Thug  and  Young Nudy  add a delightful switch-up from Savage's flows.    Riddled with sporadic narration by Morgan Freeman, his involvement feels more like crossing off an item on the duo's bucket list rather than a necessity for the album. As well, 21 could have benefitted from toning down his use of female genitalia as his go-to adlib (a whole 85 times).    In all,  Savage Mode II  will satisfy any 21 Savage and Metro Boomin fans who have been awaiting its release. Yet, in response to Freeman's question on ""Runnin,"" ""Are things better or worse the second time around?,"" it is no debate that the follow-up is not better than its predecessor.

Hope and longing meet in a sea of synths, drowning in one moment only to come up for air in the next.     As Long as You Are  is an album of culmination and release, of healing and introspection. On the 11-track foray through past and present, Herring belts about relationships, self-love and resilience.    The album reflects external shifts as well as internal ones. Drummer Mike Lowry is a full-fledged member of the band as of this year, transforming the group's songwriting process. The four also took on production duties for the first time, working with engineer Steve Wright in Baltimore.

2020-10-06,Adam Feibel,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",METZ Are at Their Most Vicious on 'Atlas Vending',,"Hell still  hath no fury  like the band  METZ . The Toronto noise rockers are functioning like a well-oiled and lethally dangerous machine on their fourth album,  Atlas Vending . Hayden Menzies hits the drums like he's trying to break them — or, if he can't break them, then beat them into the ground. Chris Slorach's bass makes it feel like the Earth's gravitational force has suddenly tripled. Alex Edkins plays his guitar as if he's wildly hacking and slashing his way through an unholy tangle of thorny vines and barbed wire. Your fingers might start to bleed just listening to some of these riffs. (Turn it up loud enough and your ears might, too.)    Following up 2017's confident and mature  Strange Peace , METZ return with a record that's as loud, energetic and chaotic as ever — if not more so — while also being their most astutely developed.  Atlas Vending  is highly dimensional and articulate in its noisiness. It's like the bright lightning of  Drive Like Jehu  meets the rolling thunder of  the Jesus Lizard , with the underworldly dark-rock of  Young Widows  keeping things on edge. Guided this time by Seth Manchester ( Daughters ,  Lingua Ignota ,  the Body ), the band expertly layer their steady and propulsive rhythms under a crooked, abrasive frenzy of guitar, with Edkins shouting dispatches from the dysfunctional maze of modern society through the clamour of it all.    The metronomic dissonance and pummelling beat of ""Pulse"" is a Daughters-esque sensory assault that's sure to get your blood pumping. (Note: If your pulse is anything like this, seek medical attention.) ""Blind Youth Industrial Park"" is a four-on-the-floor stomper that makes use of ominous contrasts. ""Draw Us In"" channels the janky, twangy riffs of  In Utero . ""Framed by the Comets Tail"" leans on bent harmonics that feel like a hypnotic trigger or the tick-tock of a countdown to something horrible. ""The Mirror"" sounds like wires reaching their tensile limit and violently snapping. ""A Boat to Drown In"" rushes like a river that you'll think is safe on the surface before being swallowed by the undertow. This imagery is all quite threatening. Given that Edkins spends the album exploring topics such as social anxiety, addiction, isolation, restlessness and paranoia, it's also quite fitting. ""Can't seem to find a way to get free,"" he intones early on.    But the main highlight of  Atlas Vending  has to be ""Hail Taxi,"" a song that shows what happens when twinkling Britpop meets the sledgehammer of noise rock. Half of it is pulverizing, and the other half is genuinely pretty — not a word that normally describes METZ's music. The band have lost none of their viciousness; their eagerness to explore a softer side just gives them more of a reason to linger in your head long after the song has ended — and it makes it harder to predict the next deafening blow. METZ are an animal that's evolved to its benefit, with an appetite that's more refined and teeth that are still razor sharp.

2020-10-06,Adam Feibel,8,"PUNK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Touché Amoré Return to Their Essential Form on 'Lament',,"In 2016,  Touché Amoré  took a creative leap forward with their distinctive style of emotive post-hardcore for their fourth album,  Stage Four , and vocalist Jeremy Bolm  dedicated the entire album to mourning the loss of his mother to cancer . He did so with brutal honesty and detail, pouring out his grief for all the world to witness. The result was an intensely cathartic album that marked a defining moment for a band that has long been associated with intense catharsis. That posed a challenge when it came time to make another record: how do you top that?    The answer for Touché Amoré is that you can't possibly match the emotional fury of  Stage Four . But what you can do is what you've always done — and do it more skillfully than ever. The Los Angeles band's fifth album,  Lament , is solid and noticeably confident. Helmed by legendary producer Ross Robinson ( Slipknot ,  At the Drive-In ,  Glassjaw ),  Lament  taps into Touché Amoré's core energy and unleashes it with skillful precision. Bolm, meanwhile, wisely shrugs off the pressure to deliver as gut-wrenching of a performance as  Stage Four . The shadow of death still lurks in the corners, but  Lament  is an album about the people who go on living.     Lament  distills the sound that Touché Amoré has been honing for more than a decade, while taking subtle cues from influences like  Envy ,  Interpol ,  Leonard Cohen  and  Cocteau Twins . ""Savoring"" and ""Deflector"" all but perfect the band's shifts from blastbeat frenzies to melodic serenity that they pursued most intently on 2013's  Is Survived By . ""Come Heroine"" perfectly pairs the breakneck speed of 2011's  Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me  with the post-rock grandeur of  Mogwai . Bolm and Andy Hull are a perfect match on ""Limelight,"" a song that reaches the cinematic heights of  Manchester Orchestra 's  A Black Mile to the Surface .  Julien Baker  returns to lend her voice to ""Reminders,"" an uncharacteristically fun and upbeat song that sounds closer to a punk rock party anthem (with a bridge that takes a page straight from the  Latterman  playbook) than the funeral march of ""Skyscraper,"" Baker's guest appearance on  Stage Four . The addition of Nick Steinhardt's slide guitar — on ""A Broadcast,"" most prominently — lends a bit of an Americana feel that sounds surprisingly right. The band also benefits greatly from Robinson's spacious, layered mix that brings everything into crisp focus.    As always, Bolm's emotional fervor often commands the most attention. Here, he returns to familiar themes of Touché Amoré records — vulnerability, regret, anxiety — while trying to make sense of life as it happens. Bolm doesn't wish to linger on the subjects of death and grieving (especially when it comes to being approached as a bereavement counsellor by others who have lost loved ones: ""I don't want this role / I give it up,"" he professes in the late-album highlight ""I'll Be Your Host""). Instead, he's intent on finding comfort and purpose in everything that still remains. ""I've healed more than suffered,"" he sings in ""A Forecast,"" a vaudevillian piano ballad with clear-eyed and unusually playful candour.    While Bolm and company still have plenty to figure out about themselves, Lament finds them at a stage in their career where they know exactly who they are as a band.  Stage Four  was a momentous release that found ways to musically express its heart-wrenching story.  Lament  feels more like Touché Amoré's essential form.

Through looping, prowess and an experimental spirit, the Los Angeles-based harpist crafts evocative and breathtaking worlds that revel in moods, melodies and contrasts.    Lattimore has released several solo and collaborative collections to date, not including playing on recordings by artists like  Kurt Vile ,  Marissa Nadler ,  Hop Along  and  Sharon Van Etten . For her newest outing,  Silver Ladders , Lattimore worked with  Slowdive 's  Neil Halstead , who produced the album and contributes guitar. And while this is not officially a collaborative piece, Halstead's artistic touch is notable.    ""Pine Trees"" opens Silver Ladders beautifully with light harp strums that are cast into haunting layered melodies. Humming bass and slow-rolling waves of synth fill out the space. Then, Lattimore comes into the foreground, gleaming overtop it all, and as everything began, it fades away. At almost 10-and-a-half minutes, longest track ""Til A Mermaid Drags You Under"" is a slow burner with deep and billowing tones, Halstead's shadowy figures floating and Lattimore's flittering shards of light shining through the miasma. ""Don't Look,"" opens with Lattimore's harp moving with restraint before blooming like little bursts of fireworks amongst booming and rattling bass and Halstead's glistening guitar wavering around it all. At times her harp sounds akin to diamond raindrops, creating a timbre that's otherworldly and elegant, as on the swaying and swelling title track and the droning and windblown ""Chop on the Climbout.""    Low-end synth tones throughout the album provide a melancholy aura that at times is given additional weight from Halstead's dreamy, wistful notes. But together, it all paints an exquisite picture; dramatic worlds that in themselves can evoke vast seas of emotion. Like the sum of life moments, memories or feelings encapsulated in songs, every element with its own purpose. And amongst these parts, Lattimore's harp feels like flickers of hope or revelation, whatever keeps people awake.

Aside from one single from supergroup  Killer Be Killed  this year, the multi-talented musician has been largely focusing on his synthwave skills in lieu of visceral musical beatdowns.    That's changed now though as the musician embarks on his first-ever solo record,  Child Soldier: Creator of God , which brings together Puciato's hardcore and metal experience, his electronic leanings and a hefty dose of industrial-tinged grunge.    Following a short acoustic-driven kickoff, Puciato brings in ""Creator of God,"" which walks the line between the Black Queen's electronic atmosphere and Dillinger's noisier, industrial aspects. This theme of branching together various aspects of Puciato's professional career carries throughout the record too, exemplified by the quick shift to his signature hoarse screams belting out in ""Fire for Water"" over top of chaotic skittering hardcore.    Puciato does a good job with his well-proven strengths, but on this record, he excels in what is less expected, such as  Child Soldier 's grungy noise rock tracks. His passion for '90s-styled tones comes to fruition in the bass-driven ""Deep Set"" or the alt-rock leaning ""Down When I'm Not,"" and while these moments shine, they don't appear often enough. In other places, some of the material on the album feels like unused ideas for the Black Queen, such as ""Fireflies"" or ""Evacuation,"" which may satisfy fans of that project, but comes off as limiting.     Child Soldier: Creator of God  is impressive in that it features Puciato's first pieces of solo music and displays his ability to work alone, as he composed and performed everything aside from drums. The downside of the record comes in its flow as well as restraint in pushing such a good musician's skills to their full potential. It works more like a collection of very strong singles than a cohesive album from beginning to end, but anyone who has enjoyed even a snippet of music from Puciato will have plenty to enjoy from this record.

With a society that lives in a bubble filled with dreams and false realities, it seems we've forgotten what the world can allow us to experience when we live with each other in the moment. Max Clarke, otherwise known as  Cut Worms , explores this narrative into deep measures and graces us with an extraordinary double LP release.    At first glance, a release so lengthy may seem intimidating, but Clarke has managed to find a way to enrapture the listener from start to finish. The record possesses winsome nostalgia explored through timbre; seamless transportation to a moment in time when the chaos of life was null and enriched by a sense of pure bliss. Clarke's penchant for country and western psychedelia is imbued in every song through incorporating pedal steel guitar, saxophone, and honky-tonk piano.    The album's poetic narrative is conveyed through clever delicate imagery. Clarke's approach sparks a light within your sub-conscience, allowing your mind to open up to exploring conviction in everyday consumption patterns. There's something to be said for simplicity that evokes such a powerful message; awakening you to the faults of human nature. Listening to Clarke decipher through these thoughts with a slight pull rather than push may lead a listener into realization.    From start to finish,  Nobody Lives Here Anymore  is a seamless expression of nostalgia, love and hope for brighter days to come.

2020-10-07,Anthony Boire,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Luka Kuplowsky Rewrites the Singer-Songwriter Playbook with 'Stardust',,"Why is it so difficult for folk artists to expand their arrangements with larger and more sonically disparate instrumental palettes? Often, on follow-up records, folk artists that succeed with sparse guitar-and-vocal arrangements find themselves incorporating so many new sounds that their unique, character-rich vocal deliveries and heady lyrics drown under the weight of a wall of sound.    Toronto's  Luka Kuplowsky  rarely has this problem. Since his third full-length record, 2017's  What Kind of Animal  — released under prior mononym  LUKA  — he has successfully expanded upon the simple singer-songwriter arrangements found on his earlier releases. A record with such tasteful flourishes of musicianship is a rare thing, but at last we come to this year's  Stardust .    The album blends Luka's smooth baritone with joyful bursts of saxophone, flute, trumpet and strings that dance around each other in unison, giving each element that all-important room to breathe. Not once are lyrics buried beneath seven musicians hammering the same chord, and Kuplowsky reads the room with delicate tonal shifts in his singing, aided by the warm additional vocals provided here by Felicity Williams and Robin Dann.    At times,  Stardust  lands on a sauntering Western feel, like on album opener ""Do I Have to Be"" and closer ""Be New."" Mainly, the album settles into a sort of lush and slinky take on folk rock, with saxophone fills and warm keys. Some tracks lyrically betray this atmosphere, like the stellar dystopia of ""City By My Window."" Here, a fretless bass riff skitters around loose, shuffling drums to contrast the repeated line, ""Perfection is a noose,"" which itself slowly begins to fight against increasingly chaotic instrumentation. One imagines Luka, imprisoned in some concrete condominium tower, softly crooning to the grimy urban sprawl from his windowsill. The album's single, ""Positive Push,"" is also its most outwardly ""rock"" track, using stuttering guitar and  McCartney -esque bass riffing to create a danceable, tense drive. Kuplowsky goes for a more biting vocal tone here, rising far above the wispy baritone here with playful nasality.    These arrangements can sometimes repeat themselves. A few songs into the record, these saxophone and string flourishes reappear with diminishing returns. This seems a shame when explosive surprises exist in small pockets all over these songs, like the bizarro jazz-rock guitar solo that caps the closing track. Luka Kuplowsky's arrangements are full and warm, but repeated listens may lead to listener complacency.    The minimal hard edges and risks that do show up bely an artist with an ear for the weird. His moment to expand upon these more ear-catching ideas may still be yet to come.

2020-09-28,Daniel Sylvester,5,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Thurston Moore Is a Pale Imitation of His Former Self on 'By the Fire',,"Throughout his 38 years as a recording musician,  Thurston Moore  has lived numerous lives: no-wave pioneer, experimental drone musician, MTV Buzz Bin staple, label boss and indie rock icon. So, to see the 62-year-old crafting something as forced and tedious as  By the Fire  isn't just disappointing, it's practically insulting.    Considering that Moore's greatest critical and commercial success came from his days as a member of  Sonic Youth , it was no surprise when Moore tried to recreate his alma mater in 2014, crafting two good-to-great LPs with his  Thurston Moore Band  that featured an art rock guitarist (Nøught's James Sedwards) and a noise-friendly bassist ( My Bloody Valentine 's Debbie Googe) à la  Lee Ranaldo  and  Kim Gordon , along with actual Sonic Youth drummer  Steve Shelley .    On  By the Fire  opener ""Hashish,"" Moore and his trio wholesale borrow the intro, main riff and melody from Sonic Youth's 1998 single ""Sunday,"" while the most poppy and compact track on the LP, ""Cantaloupe"", freely cops the guitar rhythm of SY's 1992 classic ""Sugar Kane."" But once Moore becomes tired of repurposing old riffs, noise breakdowns, and tunings, he reverts to simply repeating intros and harmonies across the album's nine tracks and 80 minutes, melding together elements from the sluggish ""Calligraphy"" and the guileless ""Dreamers Work.""    As Moore made some of his best solo work a decade back by bringing in odd bedfellows like harpist Mary Lattimore and violinist Samara Lubelski, he simply seems uninterested in challenging himself sonically this time around, aside from adding in famed experimental electronic musician Jon ""Wobbly"" Leidecker's ambient noise (which isn't utilized enough beyond the mostly excellent 17-minute standout/sore thumb ""Locomotive"")    But what may make Moore' seventh solo LP most appealing to long-time fans comes from the level of comfort and familiarity present here, as much of the material sounds like Sonic Youth, even if the quality isn't there. Witnessing Gordon and Ranaldo successfully reinvent their sounds over the past year just makes the failures of  By the Fire  that much more painful to accept. But as Thurston Moore himself once said, kill yr idols.

2020-09-28,Sydney Brasil,5,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC,PUNK,POP AND ROCK","With 'ACR Loco,' A Certain Ratio Go from Trailblazers to Followers",,"When acts stick around for so long they're inspired by the artists who once looked to them, their output often becomes cautious.  ACR Loco  is an interesting example of this, as it's basically the musical equivalent of a reserved but somewhat cool uncle telling you stories about his scenester past. It's exactly what to expect from the first  A Certain Ratio  record in twelve years, as the band have continued to make interesting choices stylistically. However, a lingering dryness remains.    At its best, the record holds onto A Certain Ratio's signature percussive ornamentation. The addition of cowbells, whistles and xylophone keeps the songs moving akin to a slow-burning dance track. This has the effect of making the songs feel longer than they actually are. This isn't always a bad thing, as it allows the more electronic elements to stand out without becoming overbearing.    That said, not all of the ornamentation on the album works to its benefit. Though the vocals have their moments — especially on tracks like ""Friends Around Us,"" where Jez Kerr's vocals have a soothing yet tinny phaser effect — the vocoder bits on ""Supafreak"" and ""Bouncy Bouncy"" teeter on being too much. It's in this way that  ACR Loco  sounds like a late  Franz Ferdinand  effort.    Because it's pretty pared back, all of its elements are able to shine through, for better or for worse. There's nothing super memorable about this record, nor is there anything horribly offensive about it either. Ultimately,  ACR Loco  doesn't match A Certain Ratio's past glories, but it doesn't erase their legacy either.

2020-09-28,Dylan Kavalsky,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Sing Leaf Blasts into the Cosmos on Beautiful, Otherworldly 'Not Earth'",,"Sing Leaf  is the moniker of introspective, innovative Toronto songwriter David Como. His latest release,  Not Earth , is a psychedelic folk album that goes beyond the unusual limitations of the genre. It is more like an interstellar vehicle that takes your mind to other worlds, evoking that same sense of wonder that you might feel while looking at the stars at night and wondering what could be beyond them.    The album's opening track, ""Easy on You,"" is true to its name. It features gentle, acoustic guitar playing and equally soothing vocals, establishing a folk palette that is pervasive throughout the record. It is also complemented by choirs, synths and sounds of nature that make you feel like you are walking through an enchanted forest.    The third song of the album, ""Honeyeater,"" marks a point when Como begins to truly experiment with atypical, alien-like noises that let you feel like you are swimming through a lake on Mars. As the tune progresses, a steady drum loop comes in, and so does a sweet melody on the flute, allowing the vibe to become more grounded and accessible.    ""Magnetic"" and ""Eggtooth"" maintain a space-y, experimental vibe, while ""Forever Green"" returns to a forest of folk. ""Sunshine"" is a highlight of this album, as it combines a moderately fast pace with an optimistic melody to make you feel like you are making a cheery reentry into Earth's atmosphere.    Como's instrumentation masterfully straddles the line between the unconventional and the familiar, while his lyrics engage on an emotional level by speaking about relationships and the most human aspects of being alive. It is not everyday that someone can weave a sonic tapestry that feels so adventurous, soothing and authentic. Kudos to Como. (Tin Angel)                           REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC               More Sing Leaf",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/sing_leaf_not_earth_album_review
2020-09-29,Kaelen Bell,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC","The World Is Finally Ready for Beverly Glenn-Copeland, and 'Transmissions' Is the Perfect Introduction",,"Following years as a precious secret to a fortunate few,  Beverly Glenn-Copeland  has suddenly arrived. Now in his 70s, the songwriter and composer possessed of a mystical warmth is enjoying the adoration that somehow evaded him for decades. His  story  has come to light over the past two years, and it holds a rare balm at its core — the knowledge that sometimes the world is a fair and kind place, even if it runs a little late.    And with the release of  Transmissions: The Music of Beverly Glenn-Copeland , new listeners are invited to witness the fascinating breadth of his music, to feel what's been out there all along just beyond scope. It's this collection that truly tells the story of Beverly Glenn-Copeland.    Though it's touted as a career retrospective,  Transmissions  isn't sequenced chronologically. This means Copeland's 70s folk compositions, like the gorgeous ""Don't Despair"" and ""Durocher,"" and a jazz-tinged live rendition of his crown jewel ""Colour of Anyhow,"" sit alongside the joyous, synthetic keyboard treasures of ""La Vita"" and ""Sunset Village.""    The nonlinear tracklist seems like a missed opportunity to trace Copeland's artistic trajectory, but it makes a sort of sense — his music exists on a whirling spectrum, only growing more adventurous with age, a wheel of sound unconcerned with time or barriers.    From his self-titled 1970s folk records to his 1986 landmark album  Keyboard Fantasies   to  Transmissions ' newest song, the haunting ""River Dreams,"" Copeland's music radiates a nearly uncontained delight. However, this isn't to say his music is always cheerful, that it isn't tearful or lonely. It's to say that his music contains the pulse of life, the understanding that even in heartbreak there is joy — that being alive, feeling at all, is a gift in and of itself. Finally, the world is ready to listen.

2020-09-30,Katie Tymochenko,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Born Ruffians Take a Non-Linear Path to Indie Rock Catchiness on 'SQUEEZE',,"While most bands had a relatively quiet summer,  Born Ruffians  found the time and inspiration to release two full-length albums between April and now. What was initially supposed to be the band's sixth studio album quickly turned into recording two albums simultaneously. Due to the abundance of material, the band decided to release both albums,  JUICE  and  SQUEEZE , this year.    Upon first listen,  SQUEEZE 's opening track, ""Sentimental Saddle,"" suggests that this will be textbook indie rock record. It's a slow start with simplistic guitar riffs and monotone vocals until a  Neil Young -worthy harmonica solo kicks in and instantly elevates the song to the next level. After some fun harmonies, the song ends on a new wave electro-rock vibe, giving fans a compete 180° from what they heard two minutes prior. It's an interesting start to the record that foreshows the rest of the album's non-linear path to indie rock success.    The band continues their experimentation on both ""Sinking Ships"" — the album's groovy dance track — and ""Waylaid / Perpetual Adoration."" The latter builds off the album's psychedelic palette and clocks in at over five minutes long, taking listeners on a respectable sonic trip.    Halfway through, listeners are treated to one of the album's highlights with ""Rainbow Superfriends."" The song is melodic and catchy — the kind of song that will get stuck in your head on the first listen. The track's wholesome aesthetic is reminiscent of an older sibling passing along advice to their younger self, giving the album one of its most satisfied song conclusions.    Initially, the gloominess of ""Death Bed"" accurately projects the feelings most of us have experienced over the past few months, but the song's upbeat acoustic chorus provides a light towards the end of the album. While the lyrics are sombre, the addition of a tambourine makes the track oddly uplifting. Concluding the album is ""Albatross,"" another grand orchestral tune that leaves listeners on an open-ended conclusion, allowing fans to draw their own assumptions about the sounds and songs they just experienced.    While the band's indie rock sound still holds true on  SQUEEZE , the addition of '60s-inspired instrumentation sprinkled throughout the album make it an interesting yet enjoyable listening experience. Born Ruffians have given fans an album full of familiarity and surprise all in one.

2020-10-01,Adam Feibel,5,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Jónsi Storms into Futuristic Pop Territory on 'Shiver',,"A full 10 years after his first solo album,  Go , Icelandic musical ambassador  Jónsi  sets aside the picturesque post-rock of  Sigur Rós  and fully commits to the cutting-edge sounds of ultra-modern pop with this long-awaited followup,  Shiver . Collaborating with the audacious English producer  A. G. Cook  ( Charli XCX ,  GFOTY ,  Hannah Diamond ), Jónsi storms into new territory with an updated arsenal of sounds while unfortunately leaving some of his identity behind.    Like much of his work with Sigur Rós, Jónsi's solo debut bloomed like the flora and fauna of spring. It incorporated tasteful bits of digital sampling into a wider landscape of natural, earthly sounds. That's not the style of A. G. Cook, whose polarizing  PC Music  record label is known for dense, noisy, tightly compressed and exaggeratedly synthetic takes on pop music. So, what you get with  Shiver  is a dense, noisy, tightly compressed and exaggeratedly synthetic take on Jónsi.    Part of PC Music's whole thing is about creating hyper-modern personas for their artists and deliberately drawing attention to the artificiality of the music. But Jónsi's artistic identity was written into the pages of public consciousness long ago, and the appeal of his music thus far is that it tends to evoke natural, earthly beauty — all the vast expanses of untouched land, the deep blue reaches of the ocean and the unreachable heights of the sky. Here, he garbles that image with sci-fi scenes of claustrophobic raves and computer hacking. Instead of being in the open air of Iceland, we're in the dystopian technopolis of  Blade Runner 's Los Angeles.    Songs like ""Shiver"" have so much beautiful melody that's buried in sonic scratches and glitches; any emotional resonance is overtaken by the kind of bass thump and gated electronics you'd expect from a  David Guetta  set. ""Swill"" takes a song that belongs at the sentimental ending of a feel-good movie and adds industrial buzzsaws and thundering hammers, placing it halfway between a drive-in theatre makeout session and a day at the local auto parts factory.  ""Salt Licorice""  works quite well as a vehicle for  Robyn , who steals the song with her sugar-sweet voice and extraordinary ear for electronic pop, yet it sounds out of place, not only in the broader Jónsi catalogue, but also among the already scattered ideas on  Shiver .     ""Cannibal,""  with its sombre atmosphere, crystal guitar sounds, deep washes of reverb and a lovely contribution from  Cocteau Twins ' Elizabeth Fraser, is among the most resilient to the digital interference of the PC Music effect. Yet that's followed immediately by ""Wildeye,"" a sonic assault that's absolutely consumed by that style; the percussion is absolutely pulverizing — at higher volumes, it's literally painful. Sometimes Jónsi and Cook will add random noise just for the hell of it: ""Kórall"" sounds like they ran Sigur Rós's ""Festival"" through FL Studio and an 8-bit PSG and then decided to blow it to smithereens.    Conversely, ""Sumarið sem aldrei kom"" (""The Summer That Never Came"") is a more barren landscape of minimal piano and vocal harmony, hewing closer to the ambient, choral sounds of Jónsi's duo with partner  Alex Somers  (who also co-produced  Go ). Likewise, ""Grenade"" employs lush, breathable instrumentals that complement, rather than distract from, the captivating countertenor that's the main source of his power. ""Exhale"" might even be one of the best songs of the year; it's spacious and still, with a chorus that feels like a weight coming off your chest: ""It's just the way it is / It isn't your fault / It isn't your fault / Just let it go.""    Yet ""Exhale"" is betrayed by the rest of the album, which tries to suffocate what traditionally brings Jónsi's music close to the heart. Throughout, he seems to be zig-zagging between adherence to his established mode de vie and a full-on commitment to this aesthetic.  Shiver  has moments of excellence, but rarely does it feel like this is how it's supposed to be.

2020-10-01,Manus Hopkins,6,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",DevilDriver Sound Like a One-Man Show on 'Dealing with Demons I',,"The new wave of American heavy metal (NWOAHM) was one of the most exciting music movements of the '00s. There are certain bands who grew past the scene and found bigger success, like  Lamb of God  and  Killswitch Engage , but they were the outliers. As the excitement of the NWOAHM wound down, several main players, such as  Chimaira ,  Shadows Fall  and  God Forbid , fell apart with it.      DevilDriver  managed to survive, but not without also taking some hits. The band had a fairly steady lineup for the first decade or so, until the early-to-mid 2010s brought a mass exodus of key members, some of whom left on less-than-good terms. With the entire rhythm section throwing in the towel and frontman Dez Fafara busy with a  Coal Chamber  reunion, it seemed like the California quintet was going the way of so many NWOAHM peers. But a new version of DevilDriver bounced back in 2016 with a solid and successful record,  Trust No One .    Since then, the band have become increasingly more centred around Fafara, the group's only remaining original member (although guitarist Micheal has been by his side since 2004). Though  Dealing with Demons I , the first volume of a planned double album, marks this lineup's third outing, it still feels like the ""new version"" of DevilDriver, and a vehicle for Fafara now more than ever.     The album doesn't start on its strongest foot; opener ""Keep Away From Me,"" is by no means a bad song, but would have been better placed later on, after a few higher-energy tracks. Things do pick up afterwards, though, with ""Vengeance Is Clear"" and ""Nest Of Vipers,"" two riff-packed bangers that almost make it feel like this is still the same DevilDriver fans know and love. From there, the album keeps up a hit-and-miss pattern: ""Iona"" is a pretty classic DevilDriver-sounding track, but ""Wishing"" would be better off without the out-of-place and somewhat distracting clean vocals on the verses, which is disappointing given that it has one of the album's best choruses and a scrupulous guitar solo. Much of the album's bottom half is a little too by-the-books, with ""You Give Me a Reason to Drink"" being the only real standout.     It's unfortunate but inevitable that this record will be compared to DevilDriver's earlier work. The band has yet to truly prove that they've still got it with a changed lineup, especially after the blunder that was 2018's  Outlaws 'Til the End Vol. 1 .     Dealing with Demons I  has its moments, but the music is ultimately plagued by the inescapable realization that DevilDriver are better as a band than as Dez Fafara and company.  (Napalm)                           REVIEWS   ALBUM   METAL AND HARDCORE   MUSIC              More DevilDriver",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/devildrivers_uneven_dealing_with_demons_i_suggests_their_best_days_are_behind_them
2020-09-30,Hayden Godfrey,7,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC",Ben Kunder's 'Searching for the Stranger' Will Make You Want to Become Friends with Him,,"If one had to describe the voice of Toronto-based singer-songwriter Ben Kunder, words like ""pleasant"" and ""friendly"" would undoubtedly come to mind. Everything about his vocal delivery, from the softness of his entrances to the steady power of his enunciation, makes for an accessible and inoffensive listening experience. This vocal charm, among other things, is on full display on his newest record,  Searching for the Stranger .    Though decidedly more instrumentally expansive than his previous release, 2018's shimmering  Better Human , his third effort maintains the intimacy while strengthening his musical and atmospheric reach. The record's flow wholeheartedly supports this, with each successive track becoming more welcoming than its predecessor.    Composed exclusively of tracks with one-word titles, Kunder's songwriting is brimming with colour, with the warm, polished-turned-triumphant backbeat to ""Berlin"" and the snappy chorus of ""Year"" serving as brilliantly accessible chapters in his musical story. Elsewhere, the straightforward ""Breakers"" and  Bruce Cockburn -esque title track illuminate the more obscure passages.    Lyrically, Kunder's tranquility shines through on nearly every track, with raw narratives accompanying every stanza. On ""Lunenberg,"" he and guest vocalist Carleigh Aikins gracefully tell us to ""breathe in, breathe out,"" reassuring listeners that ""it'll all work out."" Though a slightly overused sentiment, it's enlightening and relaxing coming with his tone. The same goes for the rest of the record; otherwise ordinary phrases are made incredibly personal and touching by Kunder's mature yet natural vocals.    While there are some more predictable musical moments scattered throughout the album's 40-minute runtime, the record is an honest, neatly packaged collection of stories with solid sonic flow.    Though not groundbreaking and sometimes predictable,  Searching for the Stranger  is a satisfying and seamless listen. A melodically holistic effort, Kunder's evolving artistry is comfortably evident, making his latest effort a strong and worthy listen for fans of intimate indie rock with an atmospheric twist.

2020-10-01,Adam Feibel,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Bartees Strange's Ambitious Creative Vision Comes to Life on 'Live Forever',,"What a year it's been for  Bartees Strange . He kicked it off with  Say Goodbye to Pretty Boy , an EP of five captivatingly reimagined covers of  the National  that turned the heads of not only online music nerds but actual famous people like  Hayley Williams ,  Ryan Reynolds  and the National's own  Matt Berninger . Six months later, the Washington, DC, artist follows it up with a debut album that's enjoyed a good amount of hype among indie critics and eager fans. He did all this while working a full-time day job at a non-profit environmental organization and, of course, navigating a year in which the average person's mind has been more than preoccupied by a global pandemic, natural disasters and a treacherous climate of racism and political chaos. But as  Live Forever  clearly demonstrates, Bartees Strange is not an average person.    Imagine this:  TV on the Radio ,  Moses Sumney ,  Burial ,  Kings of Leon ,  Death Grips ,  the Killers  and both the early and recent work of  Bon Iver  — all of these sounds colliding in one place. It's an unprecedented concoction, and it works. Goddamn it, how does it work?    It's challenging to be truly ""genre-defying"" without being in the grips of an identity crisis. But the reason  Live Forever  works is that Strange isn't trying to do too much; what we're hearing is an expression of all the art and experience that's inside him. It isn't an abundance of ideas lumped into a pile. It's held together by Strange's versatile, distinct voice and his singularly ambitious creative vision. It doesn't defy genre so much as ignore the lines between them and embrace the multiplicity of Strange's musical being. It's music for people who love music.     ""Boomer"" is the epitome of this. Strange effortlessly raps over cascading post-punk guitars, breaks into a soulful rock 'n' roll chorus, traverses a bridge section of straight-up Delta blues, and closes it out with a bit of '90s power-pop and just a touch of breezy surf-rock. Strange's singing voice is full, strong and robust — the result of a childhood spent in the opera — as he muses on spirituality while recalling a night spent smoking up with his prideful dad. ""Boomer"" sounds like a lot of things, but nothing sounds like ""Boomer.""    There's also ""Mustang,"" an infectious guitar-pop song about Strange's upbringing in his ""overwhelmingly white and racist"" hometown in Oklahoma, featuring crunchy guitars and a sparkling synth refrain, interlaced with sly cuts toward his roots in hardcore punk. Then there's the jazzy ""In a Cab,"" the rave-ready ""Flagey God"" and the fluid R&B of ""Kelly Rowland."" Before moving into late-album tracks ""Far"" and ""Fallen for You,"" which sound like they're from the vaults of early Bon Iver and  City and Colour , you'll first be violently plunged into ""Mossblerd,"" a dark, grimy, bass-heavy hip-hop track that warps and warbles ominously as Strange raps, ""These genres keep us in our boxes."" The shape-shifting idiosyncrasy of it all is underpinned by important thoughts on Black life and the racist systems — white supremacy, the prison-industrial complex, cultural stereotyping and industry-wide underrepresentation — that have shaped the perspectives and lived experiences of Strange as an artist and as a person.     Live Forever  has that  John Coltrane  philosophy: ""I start in the middle of a sentence and move both directions at once,"" the sax legend once said. Strange's future efforts may apply that way of thinking with even greater focus and intent, blending his influences into a one-of-a-kind sound (as ""Boomer"" does so impeccably), rather than serving them up side by side.    As intriguing as Strange's music already is,  Live Forever  demonstrates that there's still tremendous potential left to unlock. The word is that at the time of  Live Forever 's release, he'll have already entered the studio to work on a second album. Whenever that drops, it's entirely possible that it will be unanimously hailed as one of the best indie albums of that year.  Live Forever  is itself not quite a masterpiece, but it's a clear picture of someone who's destined for greatness. Bartees Strange is a visionary artist worth watching closely.

Midnight Manor , the second studio album from  the Nude Party , is the product of undeniable artistic development. Living in such beautiful chaos while experiencing real-time turmoil has shaped the band's dynamic and expression, which is laid out on full display.    The album opens up with a fast-paced, rockin' anthem ""Lonely Heather"" — a track that evokes the band's energetic live performances, leaving you reminiscing for the days of boozy live shows and that late-night dance fever.

Spurred on by a quickly established friendship with  Weyes Blood 's Natalie Mering and her colleague, Drew Erickson, Heidecker marvelled at how a lush and beautifully orchestrated collection of 12 songs about mid-life were appreciated and brought to life by a wondrous band.    For those who follow Heidecker's intricately vast comedy universe, which is often fuelled by meta caricatures and satire so rich, it can be tricky to tell reality from fiction, ""Prelude to Feeling"" might hint at more gentle pranking to come.

Heidecker hollers, leading the chorus of the rollicking ""Come Away with Me,"" which is a love song about being so sick of a place and the way you're living in it that you'd do anything to leave. By the next song, the lovely,  Paul Simon -indebted ""Backwards,"" Heidecker and Mering are literally singing ""Oh Canada,"" and one can only wonder if the California-based bandleader has read enough writing on American walls to finally move his family up here.    There's definitely some loose and laidback jam band-inspired stuff here, like the title track, ""Say Yes,"" and ""Long as I've Got You,"" where you can almost see the sun shining into the band's eyes on some summer festival stage.    The truly revelatory things, though, are the ballads, which Heidecker revealed a penchant for on 2019's  What the Brokenhearted Do…  But these ones are more ambitious — harmonized vocals and string sections propel ""Someone Who Can Handle You"" and the Mering-led, ""Oh How We Drift Away"" into  Elton John / John Lennon  territory. And ""Nothing"" is a perfect storm — a clever arrangement with some of Heidecker's best, wittiest and honest (and misty-eyed) lyricism.    On the artistic run of his life of late, with films, TV shows, a podcast, and a compelling command of most of the ""platforms"" we all use, Tim Heidecker should be immensely proud of  Fear of Death . It owes something to the great songwriters and studio tones of the 1970s, but it's also strikingly timeless and authentic rock music, helmed by an underground Renaissance man.

With a halt to recording a new Arcade Fire record due to  COVID-19 , Butler hasn't let his time under lockdown cease the process of making  Generations  in his Brooklyn studio.     The album explores Butlers' exploration into history and his calling as an artist. In a statement, he said  Generations  raises questions like, ""What's my place in American history? What's my place in America's present?"" Ultimately, it's about reflecting on our place in the world.     The album begins with ""Outta Here,"" a track with hypnotic energy, followed by ""Bethlehem,"" which exudes the same energy but in a punk-inspired fashion. The entire album feels nostalgic, especially on tracks like  ""Close My Eyes""  and ""Surrender,"" which recall Arcade Fire's 2010 masterpiece  The Suburbs . It's folk-like in nature, packing an intense punch but with a timeless spin. ""Not Gonna Die"" is another notable ballad featuring stellar saxophone and layering of guitars. Butler sings of ways he won't die and other ways he might — an eerie topic for sure, but a standout track on the record.       Generations  feature a magnitude of emotions, both raw and sincere. You can't help but ask yourself the same question the record poses: What do I do? What can I do?

2020-09-24,Sarah Chodos,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Sad13's 'Haunted Painting' Makes Morbidity Sound Like Fun,,"If you are fortunate enough to live somewhere where the air is getting cooler, and the leaves – and not the sky — are turning different shades of red, then  Haunted Painting  by  Sad13  might seem appropriate for a playfully macabre seasonal soirée. The title ""Ghost (of a Good Time)"" says it all.    The music is whimsical even in its morbidity. This isn't slowcore or death metal, it's pop; not so much drowning sorrows in cheap whiskey as in a bowl of glowing green punch.    But this is, of course, only a superficial read of  Haunted Painting . After her debut as Sad13, 2016's  Slugger , Sadie Dupuis — also a founding member of  Speedy Ortiz  — experienced crippling personal grief that prohibited her from making music. She was inspired by Franz Von Stuck's painting of the dancer Saharet, which appeared ghost-like to her. Confronting both losses of those close to her and a world that was crumbling, channeling haunted art seemed appropriate.    The tunes are catchy but with weird, distorted and atonal textures. ""Into the Catacombs"" is a very apt title for the first track, which opens with ominous string instrumentation. The main riff of ""With Baby"" is reminiscent of the  Ghostbusters  theme song.    While having command of many instruments, and inviting many similarly talented friends on the album with her (including a eight-piece orchestra), there is also a plethora of synths. Dupuis describes  Haunted Painting  as ""decidedly non-minimal"" and, her own instrumental repertoire includes ""toys, trash and ephemera.""    While many albums start out catchy and then become more introspective,  Haunted Painting  loses some of its moroseness to become more pop-ish. ""Market Hotel"" has a catchy, major-key feel, shot through with distorted guitar.    Dupuis, whose professional music career began as part of touring choir in middle school, previously spent a stint at MIT before dedicating herself to music and poetry. Beyond her work as Sad13 and with Speedy Ortiz, she has also collaborated with  Lizzo . It is clear that Dupuis is constantly looking for ways to expand the possibilities of what she can do, and this can be heard in her music. Morbid is a less apt description than memento mori: a reminder not to waste time.

The dream pop Young Galaxy were known for can certainly be heard in Riches' newest project,  Fantasy Chapel , and Holmes' work has been said to use ""dynamic movement and dance-based practices to ignite connection, creativity, and community,"" so it will be interesting to see the dance component of this, as well.    Dream pop combines with feminism, religion and folklore; it's all parts earthy and magical, with both playful and serious tones. This project is, indeed, intended to be multidisciplinary. From listening to the music, it is apparent that there is a clear story arc. Nine longer tracks are broken up with five brief instrumental interludes, referred to here as ""Thresholds."" Each with a unique mood, ranging from dreamy to ominous, they break the story arc into segments representing the characters' journey.    The first songs contain a hopeful expectancy; ""Fantasy Chapel,"" while not breaking from the trance-like feel of the album, has singable lyrics and a catchy, easy-to-discern melody. But then, ""Eyes Open"" and ""Thief In Your Eye"" express disillusionment both in the lyrics and the tone of the music, while ""Thief in Your Eye"" is tentative-sounding. The album finishes with a sense of reflective, resilient wisdom.    While this is clearly only one component of a multidisciplinary project, it also stands alone nicely. Connection, creativity and community have been ignited, and this is a springboard from which the larger project can develop.

2020-09-24,John Amen,7,"MUSIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC",Buildings and Food Makes the Retro Sound New Again on 'Up Down Strange Charm',,"Jen K. Wilson, a.k.a.  Buildings and Food , hones the synth-y instrumentals and avant pop heard on her prior album, 2018's  Quick Beat Save . The result is a set of retro yet voguish compositions and hook-infused songs, Wilson's stoic, sirenic voice reminiscent of  Broadcast 's Trish Keenan.     Up Down Strange Charm 's   ""FM a.m."" and ""Stretched to Our Thoughts"" feature vintage Casio-sounding synthesizers and primitive beats, the latter defined by a fetching refrain. On one hand, the pieces occur as background music, ideal to bob along to while, say, stoned and cleaning the house. On the other hand, there's a complexly bright tone to these compositions, a balance of casual performances and elegant production that warrants more focused attention.    With ""Streetlights,"" Wilson navigates a hip hybridization of dream pop and electronica, a song that might accompany the credits for a melancholy film à clef that closes with a happy ending. ""Swimming in Denton"" opens with a mix of melodic synths and roily beats, Wilson's vocal moodier, bathed in reverb, a blend of shoegaze-y pop à la  I Break Horses  and sultry textures reminiscent of Vanishing Twin. ""DdNt"" is a spacious ambient composition replete with an echoing mix of mumbled phrases and distorted accents, a track one might hear playing at high volume in a West Village boutique store. ""The Shape of Ossington"" is the album's longest and most adventurous piece, featuring beat loops and sprawling synthscapes that bring to mind  Kraftwerk  or early  Daft Punk .     Up Down Strange Charm  makes use of two templates. Or, more accurately, a template and a half: catchy, synth-y, fluid instrumentals, some with seductive vocals and some without. The album employs a narrow palette and yet remains engaging for its eight-track entirety. While Wilson doesn't cover a great deal of territory here, what she undertakes she accomplishes with confidence, resourcefulness and a signature flair.

But the proto-geriatric cruise ships bearing down the St. Lawrence no longer play the arty siren songs of yore. Joining the pile of Mile End indie-absconders ( Win Butler ,  Graham Van Pelt , etc.)  Blue Hawaii  have fully jettisoned their art pop roots in  Under 1 House  — sandblasting off the edges from their earlier dance gambits like  Tenderness  and last year's  Open Reduction Internal Fixation  — to drop a mixtape of Berlin-by-way-of-Durocher house music. Does it work?    The mixtape launches out of the blocks with a boilerplate clubby drum sequence; a twittering of candy-coated synth soon follows. But even the bilious rock revivalist is quieted once producer Alex Kerby's drums pick up and Raphaelle Standell-Preston (of  Braids ) sets off with her signature coo. The girl with the golden voice bezels this record with heart-sundering sensuality, her soprano providing the sailing emotive counterpoint to Kerby's Ableton chisel.     Under 1 House 's high-BPM, supremely danceable through-line gives the singer ample room to stunt on — she capably scrapes the Himalayas in songs like ""Feelin"" and ""I Felt Love,"" and doeishly deadpans through the mixtape's highlight, the  Purity Ring -meets- Burial  ""Where Are the Keys?"".    However, the mixtape's most titillating ear candies come thanks to saxophonist Adam Kinner, whose fleeting snatches of glorious tenor give most songs on this mixtape their golden trim.    Forgiving them their mixtape's one-off whiff, the Shazam bait whodunnit ""No Drama,""  Under 1 House  is a surefire bet to get all hips on deck a-swingin'. With this collection, Blue Hawaii have climbed into the crow's nest of Montreal's dance music revival.

But, more than this, it's essentially Public Enemy trying to do what they do best — fight the power. With much of the record acting as a stunning  indictment of Donald Trump's presidency , and with an election coming in November, those who oppose extreme right wing politics in the United States could see this as one of the most important recordings of 2020.    After a brief intro track, the record kicks off with ""Grid"" and  Chuck D 's trademark husky baritone voice alongside guest verses from  George Clinton  and  Cypress Hill . ""Public Enemy Number Won"" is another highlight track that is propped up by the addition of  Run-DMC  as well as Ad-Rock and Mike D of  Beastie Boys  fame. The ""what's old is new again"" motif permeates this record, and an uptempo redux of the classic ""Public Enemy No. 1"" from 1987's  Yo! Bum Rush the Show  fits the bill to a tee. The track on this record that is destined to be an instant classic, however, is the punch drunk funk of ""Toxic."" It features Chuck D's much loved turns of phrase and instantly recognizable cadence throughout.    It was a  rocky road to get here , but Public Enemy's return to Def Jam records has proven to be fruitful. This is an enjoyable record front to back, chock full of surprising guest appearances from legacy artists and rousing protest anthems akin to  Fear of a Black Planet  and  It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back  is all there.

2020-09-25,Adam Wallis,9,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Deftones Return to Their Roots on Pummelling, Explosive 'Ohms'",,"It's been four years since fans were left polarized by the softness of 2016's  Gore , but now  Deftones  are showing their roots, with their ninth full-length LP,  Ohms .    This album offers 10 pummelling songs and though it may not have been written with the intent to do so, it serves as a perfect musical embodiment of this year: a seemingly endless vessel of dread, despair and existential crisis. A grim descriptor? Perhaps, but it's Deftones — what else would you expect?     Chock-full of ferocity and intense negative energy — a recipe beloved by Deftones fans worldwide —  Ohms  boasts songs like ""Urantia,"" ""The Spell of Mathematics"" and ""Pompeji,"" which unilaterally scream raw power and desperation. The latter ends with an ambient, synth outro, which recalls  Vangelis 's iconic  Blade Runner  soundtrack. The atmospheric instrumental seamlessly transitions into ""The Link is Dead,"" which could easily be the album's heaviest and most urgent-sounding number. There's no sacrifice in the melodic department either, as there are plenty of beautiful segments to sink one's teeth into.    Despite clocking in at just over 45 minutes,  Ohms  feels like it's over at the snap of a finger. This might be a result of its perpetually explosive nature, however, after nearly 40 minutes of being sonically beaten, the listener is given a chance to breathe again with penultimate track ""Headless."" The self-titled song, however, is, without a doubt, the cherry on top to this modern-day masterpiece, serving as a magnificent conclusion to yet another musical journey of exigency perfected by Deftones.     Other than the sour mood that  Ohms  is likely to leave you in — at least for a few moments — it's difficult to find any vices with this album. Whether you're more partial to their 1995 debut,  Adrenaline , or 2010's  Diamond Eyes , this collection has something for all generations of Deftones fans. The musicianship and diverse writing makes it blatantly clear that  Ohms  was a collaborative effort, with each member having their moment to shine. Take Sergio Vega's performance on ""Radiant City"" for example: it's a punchy, rapid-fire bass groove bound to impress.    Yes,  Ohms  forces us to reminisce on the band's glory days and yes, they brought Terry Date back into the studio, but that isn't to say they were just trying to recreate 1997's  Around the Fur  or rehash any old sound. This record is just as unique and innovative as each album before it. It's truly and honestly a breath of fresh air, it's just once again under the helm of the producer who fleshed out their unmistakable and haunting sound in the first place. But isn't that something most of us have been asking for since  White Pony ?

2020-09-25,Matt Bobkin,8,"POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Fleet Foxes Joyfully Grapple with Their Legacy on 'Shore',,"Fleet Foxes  are, in the grand scheme of things, still a relatively young band — it's been 12 years since  their self-titled debut  found them at the fore of the indie folk revival, and they've only released three albums since, including this week's surprise  Shore . But they're definitely no longer new and certainly no longer trendsetters — such is the case with how quickly the tides turn. And  Shore , their most ebullient record to date, finds them at peace with the idea of aging and the legacy that's already begun to form around them.    After two albums of dense, knotted song structures and complex instrumentals — 2011's moody  Helplessness Blues  and 2017's gnarled, prog-adjacent  Crack-Up   — Fleet Foxes return to the straightforward arrangements of their debut, but having swapped out the pastoral folk for the brawniest rock sounds of their career. Shore is a return to the band's roots, but with a potent acknowledgment that much has changed in the interim — like visiting your hometown and wandering around the streets, taking in all the familiar sights, sounds and smells while pointing out all the differences. A new development here, a long-shuttered favourite store there.     Change, memory and nostalgia are fresh in Robin Pecknold's mind. Fleet Foxes' dependable bandleader sounds finally settled in his own skin, content with his accomplishments and unencumbered by expectations. Second track ""Sunblind"" invokes the names of deceased music heroes, from  Jimi Hendrix  and  Otis Redding  to  Richard Swift  and  David Berman , as Pecknold grapples with the legacies of his heroes alongside the subtext of his own — how will he, and Fleet Foxes, be remembered in the decades to come? It's not that doesn't seem to care, but rather that he's focusing on the human elements over the critical: ""I'm going out for a weekend / I'm gonna borrow a Martin or Gibson / With  Either/Or  and  The Hex  for my  Bookends ."" It sounds like the greatest compliment one could give him would be a namedrop in a song two decades from now.    For a band whose imagery since inception has been dominated by the natural world in stillness and chaos, the contemporary references are a sudden change of pace that thrusts Fleet Foxes firmly in today's world, instead of gathering berries on a hill in the countryside. The harmony-laden, folk meditations are present on tracks like ""Quiet Air / Gioia"" and ""For a Week or Two"" — the latter featuring lyrics like, ""Piece of wheat / In your teeth / Carrying water, pears and bread,"" as if the band releasing the album timed to the autumn equinox wasn't on-brand enough — but  Shore  finds them exploring vaster range than before. No longer do they sound burdened by the need to commit to a particular mood; Pecknold sounds freer than ever to be himself.      Though Fleet Foxes certainly have no control over their mythology,  Shore  finds Pecknold letting the worries wash off of him. By rooting himself in the sounds and feelings of his most formative moments, he channels the jubilance of his early work without any of the anxiety and pressure.

2020-09-28,Chris Ayers,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Edmonton's Sadistic Embodiment Channel Their Disdain for the Modern World on 'Blood Spell',,"In the early '90s, death metal cover art was basically a buying guide: the more brutal the art, the more excited I'd be to purchase and rush home to listen to the album. If an album cover was censored or banned, that band hit the jackpot for extra sales.  Cannibal Corpse  were the kings of horror gore, and many bands have attempted to copy their aesthetic, with mixed results.    Enter Edmonton's  Sadistic Embodiment . Taking their name from a Cannibal Corpse song, the album art for their debut album,  Blood Spell , resembles more of a medieval torture device than the blood-and-gore majesty that the album's bludgeoning riffage underscores. The painting's figure (a bruised body in tatters, with a hungry raven pecking at his exposed leg) is central to an unnamed 18th century colonial punishment, though the music is anything but old-school death metal — and definitely nowhere near Cannibal Corpse.    Album opener ""Stranger"" begins with black metal blast beats à la  Dark Tranquillity , but the tempo shifts into more melodic  Kataklysm  territory with guitarist Wally Fischer's tasteful solos. The scorching ""Suicide Ceremony"" weaves dense tapestries of despair as drummer Bryan Newbury leads the band through desiccated forests at breakneck speed. His extreme technical prowess places Sadistic Embodiment at the forefront of Canadian death metal, much like  Cryptopsy  and  Gorguts .    With the departure of founding vocalist Nate Mandrusiak, the band decided to divide the work between three throats: Fischer, bassist Curtis Vieville, and rhythm guitarist Jason Cullen. The vocals on ""Gallows Hill"" resemble a cross between  Lamb of God 's Randy Blythe and  Gorefest 's Jan-Chris de Koeijer, while ""Catherine's Braid"" follows the more traditional death metal of  Deicide 's Glen Benton or  Immolation 's Ross Dolan.    ""Nebulae (Call of the Void)"" is a short instrumental that smacks of old  Morgoth , but the  Aborted -esque ""Flesh Disposition"" distills every facet of the band's sound: death-doom, melodic leads, and weighty yet venomous chords sodden with disdain for our modern, diseased world. Sadistic Embodiment have sculpted a dire vision, and  Blood Spell  captures their love for multi-layered death metal.

These are quick and concise, no-frills indie-rock songs flecked with just enough post-surf foam to suggest a deeper connection with the currents of tradition, and free of some of the more experimental structures the band has flirted with in the past — although there's still always room for a playful lead section here and there.    Some elements from their past that haven't made the cut, and that continue to be missed here, are the noisier aspects of their debut (""Swim"" stands above almost everything they've done since in terms of emotion and urgency, for instance). But if you're a fan of the less-intense, more easy-going vibe the band has gone on to cultivate over its career,  Carefree Theatre  will deliver the goods.    Originally slated for a spring 2020 release, the album was pushed back to the fall, adding an amusingly unforeseen layer of secondary meaning to early highlight ""Karen,"" a quick character sketch of a newly-inspired musician whose talents are perhaps dubious. As usual, there's a wry detachment to Pitts's stories and observations that keep things light, for the most part, but there are more thoughtful moods as well. The title track laments the demolition of the theatre that formed the centre of Pitts's cultural world growing up, its loss symbolic of disheartening shifts in cultural/governmental priorities. There is a subtle melancholy that hangs over the album in this regard — the realization that things don't stay the same, even in familiar places.    The album gets more interesting is it goes on, with some of the more arresting details occurring in its final moments — the cool synth interlude on ""Dewar,"" for instance (at five and a half minutes, it's the one track where the band allows itself to stretch out a bit, to good result), and the striking plucked-string melody of closer ""Rose Bowl,"" which is a dead-ringer for  Sting 's ""Fields of Gold"" in a totally good way.    While these and plenty of other prior moments certainly make  Carefree Theatre  worthwhile, some of album's more pedestrian elements slide by — bouncy, sing-song verses that Pitts can obviously write in his sleep and which come off as a bit insubstantial sometimes, the whole thing threatening to blow away with the faintest breeze.  Carefree Theatre  is certainly pleasant enough to get swept up in however, and a good capstone to a decade's work.

2020-09-17,Sarah Regan,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC",Elliott BROOD Turn Their Keen Eye Inward on 'Keeper',,"Elliott BROOD  have always been, what we might call, ""musical"" time-travellers. The Southern Ontario folk-rock trio's knack is creating works that are deeply immersed in history, offering dark glimpses into the past — their 2008 breakout album,  Mountain Meadows , revisited the aftermath of the Mountain Meadows massacre in Utah, while 2011's  Days into Years  took inspiration from an excursion to WWI military cemeteries in Europe. With  Keeper , members Mark Sasso, Casey Laforet and Stephen Pitkin deal with their own battlegrounds and emotional peaks and valleys, making for tale-telling that hits closer to home.    Driven by the carefree breeziness of the mandolin, ""Stay Out"" was purposefully crafted by the band to be a foot-stomper, but their personal lyrics, touching upon the difficulties of having children, reveal their genuineness as human beings. They sing, ""And I can't go home / I wanna stay out a little while"" — a longing for a respite from their children that most parents would be too ashamed to confess. For a song meant to be played with the sun out and the convertible roof down, there's a lot of depth here. This too can be said about ""Full of Wires,"" one of the tracks that tackles the recurring subject of family relationships: the complications that arise, but also the importance of forgiveness.    On the symbolic  ""Bird Dog,""  with its edgy undertones, and the 1950s-esque ""No Way Out,"" Elliott BROOD continue to push musical boundaries, moving beyond their acoustic roots by experimenting with new sounds and palettes. The synth-accented ""The Coast"" — mixed in by producer Sylvia Massy, who has famously worked on albums by both  Johnny Cash  and  Tom Petty  — is also telling of the band's desire to add a few twists. For fans of the band's earlier works, there is still the quintessential BROOD-like fashion throughout — rollicking strings and thrashing drums are not dismissed — but tracks like these adopt a fresh energy that's worth embracing.    Though still spirited in nature (""Out Walkin'"" takes us on an airy jaunt),  Keeper  is one of Elliott BROOD's most reflective works thus far. Just look to the questioning in gentle tracks ""A Month of Sundays"" (""Will I be seeing you less and less?"" and ""Oh Me"" (""What have we done, dear?""). The album stands out as a series of intimate stories tied together by matured family men. Dancing between melancholy and tenderness, the hardships and blessings of long-lasting relationships, it's like letting light pour into a dark room.

Set up by a high school student and played in a school's auditorium, this gig must've been an interesting experience for Monk. He certainly takes a few risks: on his solo in ""Well You Needn't,"" Monk plays with pauses, bouncing between phrases and hesitating just long enough you'd think he's finished.

The band stretch out on both ""Well You Needn't"" and ""Blue Monk,"" each going for over ten minutes, and showing how hot Monk's road-tested group (Charlie Rouse on sax, Larry Gales on bass and Ben Riley on drums) could get. But the real joy of  Palo Alto  is Monk's unaccompanied ""Don't Blame Me,"" where, for six minutes, his playing twists and turns, building into a slow, emotional climax.    For a 50-plus-year-old amateur recording, the fidelity is wonderful. It sounds like you're there — you can even hear Monk's stool squeak. It's a great document from late in his career (he'd retire from playing just three years later), but it's also a highly enjoyable listen to boot. Recommended.

2020-09-22,Kaelen Bell,9,"POP AND ROCK,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Marie Davidson Leaves the Dance Floor for Pop Allure on 'Renegade Breakdown',,"Marie Davidson  doesn't make untrue music. At its best, it feels like unbroken eye contact — her music is rarely cheerful, but it finds joy, humour even, in rage. As she deadpans on the title track of her new record, ""I betray everything I make / Anger is everything I am.""     Renegade Breakdown , the astonishing follow-up to 2018's  Working Class Woman , is credited to Marie Davidson & L'Œil Nu, as Davidson invites fellow Montreal DIY stalwarts Pierre Guerineau and Asaël R. Robitaille along for the ride. Equal parts angry and playful, hopeful and heartbroken, it's easily the best work any of them — individually or otherwise — have ever made.    The record opens with its outrageous manifesto of a title track —the clearest connective thread to  Working Class Woman , with its shit-talking speak-sing —and then explodes like a firecracker, chasing a dozen styles and moods to their ecstatic endpoint. From the prog-rock storm cloud of ""Back to Rock,"" to the metallic disco stomp of ""Worst Comes to Worst"" and ""C'est parce que j'm'en fous"" or the slate grey dissonance of ""Lead Sister,"" the record is a delirious reconfiguring of '70s and '80s pop textures.     There's little in Davidson's catalogue that could have helped predict  Renegade Breakdown 's lush, crystalline songwriting — those who know Davidson for songs like ""Workaholic Paranoid Bitch"" or ""Excès de vitesse"" will likely be thrown by the gentle acoustic sway of ""My Love"" or string-laden closer ""Sentiment."" The thing that holds it all together is Davidson herself, the star at the centre of this strange universe. The icy chill that defined  Working Class Woman  has thawed, allowing deep yearning and nostalgia to colour her typically hard-edged presence.     The undeniable highlight is ""Centre of the World (Kotti Blues),"" a shimmering acoustic ballad that shifts and dives like a murmuration of starlings. Davidson sings of regret and longing, of dreams confused and lost in life's intersecting paths — its sparkling guitars and cascading chimes are the record's loping heartbeat.  Renegade Breakdown  marks a thrilling deepening of Davidson's artistic voice. In its breathless exploration, Davidson blows open a dozen new doors. From here, she could go anywhere.

2020-09-22,Adam Feibel,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",IDLES' 'Ultra Mono' Is Punk Rock for the Twitter Age — for Better or Worse,,"Like it or not,  IDLES  may be the face of punk rock in 2020. The sneering British band has exploded in popularity since releasing two critically acclaimed albums just over a year apart: 2017's  Brutalism  and 2018's  Joy as an Act of Resistance . They've been embraced for their intensity, their vulnerability, their bluntness and their inclusivity; for letting out their sadness, their rage and their joy and turning it into a movement. They say what punks want to hear and they say it loudly and brazenly. Fuck Brexit. Fuck Trump. Fuck the patriarchy. Fuck white supremacy. Fuck the system. Destroy, rebuild and rejoice.    While IDLES' third album  Ultra Mono  draws heavily from the genre's canon, it's very much a product of its time. The record scrolls through earnestness, anxiety and ironic shit-posting at the speed of a finger flick. They are a self-serious yet completely over-the-top rock band, which — like anything that gains notice on the internet — makes them highly susceptible to skeptics, critics and haters. It's punk rock in the Twitter age.     Musically, IDLES are louder, heavier and rowdier than their neighbours in  Fontaines D.C.  and  Shame , stopping short of the hardcore punk of similarly acerbic groups like  Drug Church  and  Single Mothers .  Ultra Mono  is generally slower and sludgier than  Joy , full of midtempo jams delivered with bottom-heavy bass and two-tonne guitars. There are more industrial-influenced songs like ""A Hymn"" that share stylistic space with  Deftones ,  Hum  and  the Jesus Lizard  and fewer of the basement-party anthems and circle-pit starters like ""Danny Nedelko.""    In the hands of Nick Launay and Adam Greenspan, IDLES sound more tight and punchy than ever. With brash, uptempo songs like ""Model Village"" and ""Carcinogenic,""  Ultra Mono  feels a bit like hearing old-school  Dead Kennedys  worship crossed with the Bush-era sloganeering of  Anti-Flag  and  Green Day , redesigned for a generation that's been bred to be even more angry, cynical and snarky than their predecessors. According to the band, the record was also ""constructed to capture the feeling of a hip-hop record."" That's a stretch, even with contributions from  Kenny Beats  (whose other collaborators include  Denzel Curry ,  Vince Staples  and  03 Greedo ). But trying to tap into the success of hip-hop is very much a sign of the times. So if you're looking for a punk band that's of its era, IDLES have that part covered, too.     The centrepiece of IDLES has always been the howling hooliganism of Joe Talbot and his polemical, sardonic stump speeches. He's more unhinged than ever on  Ultra Mono , gear-shifting between smart-alecky shouting, full-blown bellowing and ornery exhibits of onomatopoeia. Talbot makes an astounding commitment to his bits, which means that he can pull off the type of belligerence that only  Serj Tankian  and a few others have attempted, whether he's hitting you over the head with the same word over and over again (""Model Village""), making the ""clack-a-clang"" sounds of a ""gun going bang-bang"" (""War"") or literally barking like a dog and gnawing like a beaver (""Kill Them with Kindness"").    While the theme of  Joy as an Act of Resistance  was self-evident,  Ultra Mono 's message is a bit muddier. It gives equal space to individualism and collectivism, to kindness and vengeance, to personal grievances and the greater good. Talbot takes issue with warmongers, flag-wavers, white nationalists, homophobes, misogynists, sexual abusers, capitalists, politicians, ""the machine,"" gatekeepers and general ""pricks."" He snarls at individual bad actors, but saves his harshest barbs for the broader systems of inequity. He repeatedly utters the mantra ""I am I,"" while also frequently urging unity. ""Do you hear that thunder? / That's the sound of strength in numbers,"" he declares in ""Grounds."" Absurdist analogizing and macho-political muscle-flexing tend to overshadow the record's more trenchant commentary, but Talbot has reasonably decided that clever critique is not as good of an on-stage rallying cry as a full-throated ""eat shit,"" and that it's not worth risking ambiguity in a song about the war industry (""War"") or sexual harassment (""Ne Touche Pas Moi"") when you could just scream ""anti-war!"" and ""consent!""     As they've gained notoriety, IDLES have been subjected to purity tests of both their politics and their punk cred, some unduly harsh and others quite reasonable. (Frankly, it is consistent with the commonly criticized performative allyship of social media to proclaim ""Black is beautiful!"" on an album that features a long list of guests — including  David Yow ,  Jamie Cullum ,  Jehnny Beth  and Warren Ellis — but no Black artists.) Consequently, vocalist Joe Talbot has developed a preoccupation with ""haters"" that, if left unchecked, could lead to full-blown  Eminem  syndrome. Listening to IDLES is obviously not the same as activism, but their intentions are good.    It's also worth noting that even at its most politically incisive and cerebral ( Propagandhi  and  Fugazi  come to mind), punk is fundamentally a visceral, physical art form. IDLES are at their best when they know their limits and play to their strengths. Like a hard liquor, they're harsh, bitter and indelibly intoxicating. They will provoke you to join a mosh pit or ram your head into a wall, and they might prompt you to vote Labour in the next election. They're not about to incite a revolution, but  Ultra Mono  encourages people to throw a punch in the right direction.

2020-09-22,Manus Hopkins,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Kataklysm Are at Their Tightest and Most Aggressive on 'Unconquered',,"During these tumultuous and unpredictable times, fans of  Kataklysm  were able to breathe a sigh of relief when frontman Maurizio Iacono declared  during a recent appearance on the MetalSucks Podcast  that bands delaying their albums amidst the ongoing global pandemic were ""unmetal.""    What this meant, in addition to confirming the Montreal death metal heavyweights' impressive work ethic, was that fans wouldn't have to wait longer than expected for the much-anticipated follow-up to 2018's  Meditations . Kataklysm have never been a band to keep fans waiting between releases, and have managed to maintain a consistent output without sacrificing quality for 25 years.     Unconquered  sees the band at their tightest and most aggressive. After a short melodic intro, opener and lead single ""The Killshot"" springs the album into full force. While each subsequent track brings something new to the table, they all sustain the record's intensity, including slower, gloomier tracks like ""Icarus Falling"" and ""The Way Back Home,"" which have some of the biggest musical hooks on the album, courtesy of guitarist J-F Dagenais. '""Cut Me Down"" smoulders with fiery ferocity, ""Stitches"" bleeds with impenetrable groove and ""Focused to Destroy You"" has a massive chorus that crowds will find impossible not to shout at the top of their lungs once the band gets the chance to perform this material live. The only real downside to  Unconquered  is that it doesn't end with more of a ripper — it feels as though it's one fast, in-your-face song away from having a perfectly chosen tracklist.    The  Unconquered  listening experience is hugely enhanced by the immersive mix, which gives just the right amount of space to each instrument. The guitars in particular are expertly balanced, and Oli Beaudoin's drums sound as if they're pounding the listener's brain. Nobody needs to prove that Canadians know how to make some of the most exciting death metal out there today, but this immense album is all that's needed to disprove anyone who says otherwise.  ( Nuclear Blast )                           METAL AND HARDCORE   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Kataklysm",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/kataklysm_unconquered_album_review
2020-09-23,Allie Gregory,10,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Sufjan Stevens Plots a Way Forward from Our Apocalyptic Present on Groundbreaking 'The Ascension',,"Twenty years into  Sufjan Stevens 's catalogue, there's still no way to predict what he'll bring to the table next. His records, while always highly conceptual, remain scattershot in their topics, genres and frequency. The latest in a string of experiments,  The Ascension , is no different. But something has changed significantly in his approach. Despite sharing common ground with both 2010's epic, electronic  Age of Adz , and 2015's autobiographical, grief-stricken  Carrie & Lowell ,  The Ascension  presents itself as something beyond the sonic comparison of the former and has somehow taken a massive step back from the intimacies at the forefront of the latter.    Conversely, Stevens is actively looking outward to the chaos of the world and our collective experience in real-time. He's no longer musing about abstract and whimsical concepts like the planets, the 50 states or the Chinese zodiac.  The Ascension  taps into something else altogether: the policies, conventions and emotional blueprints that bind us within our humanity and in the world — and the inherent problems therein. Here, he acts as the messenger for broader, existential topics. Having removed himself from the equation in this enormous new project, Stevens speaks to the greater whole, to a generation, and to a civilization on the brink of economic, environmental and political destruction to ask, ""Where do we go from here?""    It's a question that begets revolutionary theorizing. As it is, there is only so much that even studied, valid critique can do in the way of tangible change; it's not enough anymore to simply point to our problems and say ""no more."" We have to — need to — plot a way forward if we're going to survive.    Through its 15 tracks and gargantuan runtime,  The Ascension  does just that. Doing away with his more esoteric sensibilities, Stevens appeals to a broader base, using his intellect to drive home universal ideals through newly employed devices. Aggregating segments of the zeitgeist and the collective unconscious, low-art pop culture references, alongside a hardcore dance floor ethos, he is weaponizing the status quo for radical, challenging thought.     It's no assault, though. As a balanced collection of critique (""Sugar,"" ""Ativan,"" ""Video Game,"" ""America"") and compassion (""Run Away with Me,"" ""Tell Me You Love Me,"" ""The Ascension""), the record finds itself prioritizing the value in the intersection between self-care and progress. It's a polarizing undertaking that is at once apocalyptic and optimistic, and at either extreme, urgent. The resolve is clear. We all — Stevens included — have a lot of work to do on ourselves and among each other. We must re-evaluate our current systems and structures. How do they serve to protect us, uplift our culture and preserve our future? How does compassion for one another factor into capitalism? Does it?     In the absence of any real answer, the only way forward is through love. In the vital words of RuPaul, ""If you can't love yourself, how the hell are you gonna love someone else?"" It's this mission statement that has been sneaking into Stevens's work for years. He's tired of being quiet. He's done with subtlety. He's cranky as all hell with the state of it all and he's not going to shut up about it.     The antithesis to pervasive corruption — radical love — is at the forefront of the record, and most apparent in ""Tell Me You Love Me"". In its opening lines, Stevens sings, ""My love, I've lost my faith in everything / Tell me you love me anyway."" The song crests at the crushing refrain, ""I'm gonna love you / I'm gonna love you every day."" Even in emerging from the darkness of the anxiety-ridden ""Ativan,"" he sings, ""I'm doing the best I can (with what I am)."" These are two of many instances where his plans for collective ascension reveal themselves. To meet the dark with the light.    Sonically,  The Ascension  is a lot to digest, but its intentional severity works to its favour. It's densely packed with jarring, unfamiliar sounds and varies in its vocal cohesion. It's filled to the brim with contradictions and dualities. Gentle and aggressive, perplexing and comforting, the album is both an exorcism and an exercise. Incidentally, it's simultaneously a distillation of his many trademark sounds while also a massive departure from his previous works.    The album demands multiple, active listens, but it's well worth the effort. Hidden beneath its complex layers lies an endless well of new modalities, critical interpretations and potent ideas. Stevens's latest not only petitions for unconditional love and change among us all, but it also represents a dramatic metamorphosis for the artist as well. It's not an album we could have ever expected in 2020, but it is the one we deserve. It may very well be his most challenging and ambitious undertaking to date as well as a sign of the new era of Stevens to come.

2020-09-23,Vish Khanna,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Yves Jarvis Is Both Puzzling and Totally Brilliant on 'Sundry Rock Song Stock',,"It's hard to know how  Yves Jarvis  does it. His instrumentation and approach to singing all seem familiar enough, but on songs like ""In Every Mountain,"" with its start-and-stop structure, his music has less of a sound and more of a hue.    The Montreal-via-Calgary explorer of time, space, and his own instincts, is truly in top form on  Sundry Rock Song Stock . The multi-layered tunes get way down deep into your mind, curling up to pleasure points like a soulful, psychedelic cat. Jarvis's voice is some kind of collage machine; when he sings, many aspects of his persona have seemingly come to a mutual understanding of what needs to be said but don't quite agree on when to start saying it. It's a wash-y whoosh of expression.    Musically, Jarvis is on some weird Alan Parsons-meets- J Dilla  shit. ""Abrosia"" recalls a  Bitches Brew  cut with the drum faders pulled down to the ground, while something more peaceful, like  ""Victim,""  has the hallmarks of an AM pop ballad, until all of the Yves Jarvis-es whisper-sing together, somehow both tenderly but with just enough eeriness to be off-kilter.    As he has done on recent albums, Jarvis adopts colour theory again, moving from ""morning yellow optimism"" and ""midnight blue contemplation"" to what he believes is his ""natural state of green,"" which conjures ""feelings of wildness, boundless energy, and an anti-establishment streak."" Is this why Jarvis created an outdoor studio set-up to capture  Sundry Rock Song Stock  and its airy, liberated vibe? Your guess is as good as Wikipedia's entry about colour theory. All we can truly know is that Yves Jarvis has brought his insides out on a spellbinding album that's equally puzzling and gratifying.

With no hesitation or self-consciousness, Gently brings us back to the fun, empowering pop of 1980s stars like  Prince  and  Madonna  with the hooky, sassy songs of  Don't Wait to Love Me .    The drag alter ego of  Gentleman Reg , Regina Gently is pure id. The proper, modest Reg would rarely dare to be this bold and cocky, as Regina is on the scolding ""Any Other Boyfriend"" and ""Whole Wide World."" The persona has prompted more universal outspokenness too: ""Good people / Fucked over / Again"" she sings with seething resignation on ""Good People"" and boy, does the Madge ever come shining through on the inspiring ""Work it Out.""    Tapping into a similar vein as  Peaches  for raps on ""You Can be the Dancefloor"" and the call to arms (and legs and torsos) that is ""Sex All the Time,"" Gently is fun, flirty and assertive about what a good time lies ahead for everyone in her vicinity. Canadian TV fans who miss  Electric Circus  — not to mention everyone else who can't be in a club these days, where the walls and floor are shaking with joy — would do well to crank up  Don't Wait to Love Me  and lose themselves in the power of positive thinking.

All of the band's past records recall grown-up emo sounds, allowing the listener to leave the angsty days of  My Chemical Romance  and  Fall Out Boy  behind and transition into something a little more mature. Sure, the themes and topics stay the same (hometowns, New Jersey, Portland, exes, current crushes), but the language evolves.    The Menzingers are a band that has grown with their audience.  From Exile  is an acoustic version of their 2019 release  Hello Exile , offering a more tender look at the songs fans have grown to love — a chilled out, calmed take on pop-punk, slowing down and settling into autumn weather. Ballad ""Anna"" is mournful for a love lost, and opening tune ""America (You're Freaking Me Out)"" is a powerful starter song, discussing George Floyd, police brutality, living inequalities and drastic differences in common existence. It's a strong message, and even more powerful without dramatic production; slowed-down and sparse, the message shines through even more.    One of two pre-released singles from the record, ""High School Friend,"" is deep and personal. It seems to say: we've outgrown each other, we've moved on from here, but the place has stayed the same. A bit of a country-esque ballad-y homage to hometowns (in this case, Wayne County), they channel a highly relatable feeling when they talk about returning to their roots.    Though in essence a re-release,  From Exile  feels very new. Each acoustic rendition of an old song brings a new spin, a new way to absorb the messages and the secret story found within the lyrics.  From Exile  ends with ""Farewell Youth"" — a reminder that, just like the band, we've all grown up. It's fun to dive down and reminisce about nights spent suckling Jameson under bridges or on the playground, but we can't be kids forever; this helps us accept it.

Róisín Murphy , Ireland's unflappable patron saint of dance, is one of these artists. Her new record, the sweating disco onslaught  Róisín Machine , is evidence of an artist uninterested in zeitgeist-baiting, the sound of discovering new colours decades into an already kaleidoscopic career.    Those after the locked-in pop immediacy of 2007's ""Let Me Know"" or the playful bossanova of 2016's ""Lip Service"" may find themselves lost in  Róisín Machine 's marathon throb — this is music to move deeply to, to melt into and let your muscles react as they may. The entire record taps into the ecstatic robo-sensuality of  Donna Summer 's landmark ""I Feel Love"" — laced with moans and anchored by Murphy's smoky, never-been-better voice, it mines new depths of desire, humour, resignation and passion on the dance floor even as it moves with the air-tight efficiency of its titular machine.    It's built like a club mix, each song melting into the next in a pulsing chain, and the pre-released singles are reintroduced with slightly new arrangements. Murphy presides over these long, serpentine tracks with an untouchable cool, her delivery rarely belying the carnal humanity of the lyrics. Her power is borne of a refusal to be embarrassed by or afraid of her faults and feelings, and she runs the gamut of the heart here: ""I'm totally in love with you,"" she sings on shimmying highlight ""Shellfish Mademoiselle,"" while on superb single ""Incapable,"" she wonders, ""Never had a broken heart / Am I incapable of love?""    Its heights, from the gargantuan ""We Got Together"" to the tender groove of the Amy Douglas-penned ""Something More"" or the frantic funk of closer ""Jealousy"" — far outweigh its weaker spots, like the somewhat directionless throb of ""Kingdom of Ends."" Still, the lows are only relative to the highs —  Róisín Machine  is among Murphy's best works, a showcase for one of dance music's most endlessly fascinating figures.

2020-09-23,Daryl Keating,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Edmonton's Khotin Wields Nostalgia with a Deft Hand on 'Finds You Well',,"Anyone who's familiar with the work of Edmonton producer  Khotin  will know that he wields the subtle art of nostalgia with the deftest hand around. All of his releases ooze with a rich dose of sentimentality that never tumbles into mawkishness. It's a tough skill to master, but Khotin has nailed it, and it's this tricky skillset that he brings to new album  Finds You Well .    In order to talk about Khotin's latest, we're going to have to do something trite, something that's all too prevalent in music journalism: we have to compare it to  Boards of Canada . The sonic similarities, at points, are just too striking to ignore. It's impossible to hear  Finds You Well  tracks like ""Ivory Tower"" and ""Groove 32"" without BoC immediately springing to mind. After the Scottish duo released  Music Has the Right to Children  in 1998, scores of producers ( possibly BoC included ) have tried to capture that sound but never quite managed. Khotin has, and he does it his own way.    Where BoC have vocal samples of scientific narrators or people blankly blurting out random numbers, Khotin has benign, and sometimes sweet, answering machine messages strewn throughout the album. This means, as always, Khotin offers a certain warmth — something that's often lacking with this particular style. We're done with the BoC correlations, but it has to be said that  Finds You Well  just might be the best downtempo ambient record since  Music Has the Right .    While the first half of the album does feature those quasi-industrial, homesick beats that we love so much, the second half (or so) takes a more shapeless approach. It slows down significantly, taking you along some ambient paths to round out the record. This is not to say that it fizzles, however; more like it gently evaporates into a balmy cloud, ready to wash down on you all over again, once you re-press that play button (which you will).    We hope this album finds you well, quietly knowing that you'll find it very well indeed.

After their late '90s/early '00s commercial peak, 2009's remarkable  Embyronic  paved the way for a scattershot decade that saw them taking their sound into some dark and fascinating new places, as well as doubling down on their cloying earnestness and disregard for notions of indie credibility. On their latest release,  American Head , Wayne Coyne and the gang now seem to be moving away from both the electronic experimentation and the  Miley Cyrus collabs  for the time being, and they've recorded what might be the most straightforward set of songs in their career to date.    Featuring mostly piano or acoustic guitar ballads that are relatively unembellished, the album is a reminder of how influential classic rock staples like  Neil Young ,  Pink Floyd  and  the Beatles  have always been on Coyne's songwriting and vocal style, and songs like ""You n Me Sellin' Weed"" or ""Mother Please Don't Be Sad"" aim for the disarming lyrical simplicity of some of his best work. However, without the Lips' trademark guitar fuzz, electronic noise or symphonic grandeur, it just doesn't hit with the same force. Guest vocals from  Kacey Musgraves  provide an interesting counterpoint to Coyne's reedy emoting on penultimate track ""God and the Policeman,"" but its basic melody still struggles to get off the ground.    Discussing the album's title in interviews, Coyne explained his desire to be more conscious of his origins and his place in the world, and he perhaps felt a need to speak more directly to the recent political turmoil that has engulfed his country. For a band that's spun fanciful yarns from the farthest reaches of time and space and the inner recesses of their own minds, this grounded perspective could be another interesting change of direction. But for now, it feels more like a retreat.

While she liberally employs all varieties of instruments, from analog synthesizers to violins, the organ is Davachi's go-to, and she makes ample use of it on  Cantus, Descant . This double album (the first on her new label, Late Music) centres around all varieties of organ — pipe, reed and electric — with other instruments, most notably piano and strings, sailing in.    Appropriately enough, given Davachi's penchant for early music and her background in philosophy (she holds a B.A. from University of Calgary), this album could be interpreted through the ponderings of the 6th century musical philosopher, Boethius. He believed there were three essential types of music in existence, two of which were  musica universalis , the holy music of the planets, and  musica instrumentalis , the comparatively inconsequential sounds made by singers and instruments. The sprawling  Cantus, Descant  oscillates between these two worlds, balancing celestial, atmospheric tracks such as ""Hanging Gardens"" and ""Gold Upon White"" with vulnerable, intimate songs like ""Canyon Walls.""     This play between the human and divine is especially evident when Davachi's frail voice drifts onto the record. This is a new area for Davachi, who has never before sung on her recorded work. The fact that her voice only appears for two songs on this 17-track, 81-minute collection emphasizes its littleness; it's refreshing and surprising when the record is brought back to Earth, and highlights its beauty when it takes off into soundscape.     Cantus, Descant  is accessible without ever feeling thoughtless, plays to Davachi's sonic strengths, and provides just enough experimentation and variety to justify its daunting running time. It's a journey worth taking.

2020-09-15,Daniel Sylvester,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Osees' 'Protean Threat' Keeps John Dwyer's Hot Streak Impossibly Alive,,"In an era of rampant hyperbole and fake news, there's one singular truth; John Dwyer has never made a bad album under his  Thee Oh Sees  variations. After a trio of prog influenced, nearly-metal releases as  Oh Sees , the current lineup have eased back into their psychedelic garage rock sounds, while slightly changing their name to  Osees . Twenty-three LPs in, the San Francisco quintet roll out their tried-and-true blueprint and scribble some minor adjustments throughout this 13-track, 39-minute album.    Tightening two-thirds of the album's tracks up to wham-bam two-minute runtimes, Dwyer and company somehow make  Protean Threat  sound fresh and inventive. While a few of the record's tracks draw from Dwyer's recent musical endeavours, including the warped synth sound of his long-running  Damaged Bug  project (the brief instrumental ""Wing Ruin"") and his 2020 jazz supergroup  Bent Arcana  (the jammy five-minute standout ""Said the Shovel""), much of  Protean Threat  nonetheless works off of the energy and familiarity of Osees' guitar riffs and pedal racks. The 2018 addition of second drummer Tom Dolas has allowed tracks like fuzzed-out opener ""Scramble Suit II"" and synth/guitar hybrid ""Mizmuth"" to come off much noisier and more chaotic than anything they've done throughout their garage rock incarnations.    But once the listener is able to cut through the song effects, accessories and accoutrements (which really add to tracks like ""Dreary Nonsense"" and ""Toadstool""), its clear that Osees still know how to to give the fans what they want, as guitar chugger ""If I Had My Way"" and hyper-groover ""Gong of Catastrophe"" expertly demonstrate. Even though  Protean Threat  proves to be an adventurous, quirky and downright strange album at times, Osees manage keep the whole thing sonically grounded and consumable, all while keeping Dwyer's winning streak impossibly alive.

2020-09-16,Rachel Evangeline Chiong,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Decoration Day's 'Makeshift Future' Turns Life's Uncertainities into a Comforting Hug,,"Decoration Day 's debut album,  Makeshift Future , is a reflection of life's inevitable uncertainty. This theme hits close to home in the fall, a season known for longer evenings and new semesters. The album's titular track seamlessly captures the feeling of gazing out the window of your barely moved-in bedroom, hoping that the warmth of the season's first sweater guards you from the flood of new challenges in the coming weeks.    With sombre and whimsical instrumentation,  Makeshift Future  is a warm, assuring hug. Guitarist Justin Orok's strumming is a splendid and gentle fit for end-of-summer campfire ditties like ""Harry Goes to War."" The mix of woodwinds, upright bass and strings is playful and comforting, similar to the music that scored hand-drawn cartoons. The bumbling bass clarinet in ""Wild Birds Unlimited"" sounds like a dissonant chorus of birds and the vibraphone of ""Cattails"" imitates the delicate swaying of the cattails bending in the wind against a latte-coloured sky.     Decoration Day are the tiny, quiet voice that speaks to you in times of need. In ""Sadness in Disguise"", they remind you that ""seasons change when you do."" The lyrics are delivered with utmost care like ebbing waves or the kiss of a steaming cup of tea on a cold morning. By album's end,  Makeshift Future  has grown into its rich, picturesque vision. The final song, ""Meadows'', is in some ways a medley of the tracks that came before it. The song progresses like a slow cinematic zoom out, revealing how all the different themes from the previous songs made up one vibrant, coherent scene.    Yet while all the anxieties of life will still continue after the album ends, at least for a few moments, listeners can feel safe and understood among the teetering wreckage of their own makeshift futures.

2020-09-16,Luke Pearson,9,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",A. G. Cook's 'Apple' Is the Most Fully Realized Version of PC Music's Iconoclastic Pop,,"Having become known for a certain insouciance and challenging of conventions, it was perhaps not shocking that  7G , producer and PC Music head  A. G. Cook 's recent 2020 debut full-length, turned out to be a 49-track concept album with sections organized by instrument — a bold choice to say the least. Those yet to emerge from this grand tour (or those interested but reluctant to embark) will likely find their attention drawn irresistibly by his surprise follow-up, the much more obviously brilliant  Apple , released a mischievous one month later.     Apple  is, frankly, the album many fans were likely secretly disappointed they didn't get with the impressive but unwieldy  7G  — that is, a continuation in the style of Cook's previous singles and work for other PC Music artists. Indeed, it's hard to imagine anyone not immediately favouring this excellent album to its predecessor — if  7G  was the vast orchard, the diminutively-titled  Apple  is its ultimate issue, the most fully realized version yet of Cook's iconoclastic take on pop, polished to a sheen.    Much has been written about Cook's allegedly post-ironic style — exasperatingly insincere to some, playfully aloof to others — but  Apple  honestly comes across as quite serious, with the saccharine melodies and trite vocals of some of Cook's earlier projects gone in favour of a stately gloom that seeps nicely into rockier cuts like ""Beautiful Superstar"" and ""Jumper."" Certainly his glitched out vocal style will remain an acquired taste (and Cook lays it on as heavily as ever here), but he continues to occupy a field of his own in this regard, exploring the uncanny valley to its last inch before shooting into the sky on a lead built from vowel sounds — the gorgeous bridge of ""Oh Yeah"" is a great example of the latter, a starry-eyed solo that's like a leveled-up version of one of Daft Punk's best vocoder moments.     Things do teeter into self-indulgence sometimes (the digital warbling of ""Animals"" is unlikely to get much extended play), and overall your mileage may vary on some of Cook's more idiosyncratic chirps and quirks, but it's all delivered with such fresh energy and so many original production ideas that it's honestly hard to gripe too much. If you've been vibing on  Hannah Diamond 's Cook-produced debut  Reflections   recently and were somewhat baffled by  7G , look no further than  Apple , a bold and exciting album that boasts focus as well.

Its subtitle may suggest a retro-affair, but there's a broad definition of soul here. ""Make Ya Say Yie"" is dusty Memphis soul on acid and is easily the most adventurous thing Arrington has committed to wax, while ""You're Not Ready"" is soulful house with an industrial finish..

2020-09-17,Vish Khanna,9,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK",Daniel Romano's Staggering 2020 Fully Pays Off on 'How Ill Thy World is Ordered',,"To fixate on the quantity of  Daniel Romano 's output in 2020, instead of the high quality of it, is to be blinded by volume.    So, never mind that  How Ill Thy World Is Ordered  is his 10th release of 2020 (and counting — the world might be ending but the year is hopefully not wrapping up ahead of schedule) and instead dig its unique rock splendour, wherein vocals work together beautifully (wtf: ""Amaretto and Coke"" is just too gorgeous a singing display) and a band swings and storms and explodes at all of the exact right times.    People in such bands are often relegated to not only the last but also the least so first, let's name the  Outfit , as it has  Wu-Tang 'ed beside Romano here: Julianna Riolino (vocals), David Nardi (guitar, vocals), Roddy Rossetti (bass) and Ian Romano (drums). Features were provided by Mark Lalama (organ, piano), Briana Salmena (vocals), Victor Belcastro (sax) and Aaron Hutchinson (trumpet).    The album's earliest lore suggests this configuration gathered together, played live off the floor, running through the songs in sequence up to a max of three takes, and overdubs were never recorded ever. Fuck you, overdubs!    Those are the fascinating facts, and the purity of process they speak to adds some mystique, sure — but in truth, whatever happened between these people sounds magical without knowing all of the details. After the hypnotic lure of the opener, ""A Rat Without a Tale,"" an electric guitar rips through space to welcome us to the reasoned anger of the title track. Romano sings of passion fruitlessly negotiating with commerce and you can almost smell all the worthless cash burning.    On  ""Green Eye-Shade""  and ""First Yoke,"" the  Plastic Ono Band -y rollicking rage is measured slightly by the family band vocals. At least a bit: their sweetness is vaguely eerie, as these back-up flourishes are often delivered with an even calm in the midst of musical storms. It doesn't sound like a cult gathering, that's for sure?    Romano has proven himself dynamically agile over the years, leaving any genre pigeonhole before you can even spot him in one. As they proved on their astounding and recently released live album,  Okay Wow , the Outfit are onto a sound that feels familiar yet exhilaratingly fresh and foreign. Rock'n'roll that celebrates the open-ended nebulousness of the term.     How Ill  begins with a charge but begins to relax a bit for the two-part ""Joys Too Often Hollow,"" which allows Romano room to sing more sweetly, yet also signals a psychedelic warping of sounds and feelings ahead.    With its horns, keys, and other tasteful textures (including an alluring bass gallop on the superb ""No More Disheartened by the Dawn""),  How Ill Thy World Is Ordered  is a thoughtfully orchestrated masterpiece that reveals something neat and new the longer you stare at it. Lyrically, musically, and critically, Daniel Romano is a soothsaying sorcerer operating in plain sight, and we wouldn't do so bad to pay attention to his thoughts about how we're living in the world today — whenever, and how ever often, he asks us to.

2020-09-17,Vish Khanna,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC","Neil Young's 'The Times' Is Timeless, and That's Why It's So Depressing",,"It's weird (and sad) how timeless this is.    Hearing  Neil Young  sing some of his most politically charged songs, on his own, during a pandemic in 2020, is rather startling. Who has more fire in their belly than him? That he can sound as charged up as a 20-year-old, mad as all hell during a U.S. presidential campaign, but using a gentle register of his voice that somehow makes him sound like he means it more than he ever has, is remarkable.    Captured for Young and  Darryl Hannah 's  Fireside Sessions  (specifically, the  ""Porch Episode"" ), wherein he performed livestreams to soothe fans in the uncertain, early part of the ongoing COVID-19 isolation saga, the seven songs that make up  The Times  are stark and haunting. They could be intimate demos, never meant for anyone else to hear. But the resonance of classics, like ""Ohio"" (which condemned U.S. President Richard Nixon) and ""Campaigner"" (which, slyly, sympathized with him) were never going to be contained or locked down, even if we are.    Purposely chosen to compare Donald Trump with his most similar presidential counterpart (who famously insisted, ""I am not a crook,"" when he really, really was one), these topical songs have only overstayed their welcome because their thematic inspirations have. America is really fucked up right now but Young, to make a point, draws a line back to a time when that country seemed just as politically fraught and fucked up (it wasn't, but it was still super bad).    He even sings us  Bob Dylan 's 1964 social and civil rights anthem  ""The Times They Are a-Changin'""  as a hopeful gesture. It's telling that it's the first sign of labour for Young here, because, for all of our collective progress, MAGA has been successful in at least getting us to constantly ponder our vision of a world where it's still 1963. It's not like Young is singing this ironically, but it feels a little like it is.    Revising his own 2006 song ""Lookin' for a Leader,"" in which he predicted President Barack Obama's ascent, Young takes aim at Trump's America, specifically highlighting its overt racism and decrying the whole of it. What better counterpart than one of Young's most outspoken and incendiary songs, ""Southern Man."" Goddamn, the crosses in this song have been burning since 1970, and so many of us chose to stop paying attention to them for 50 years. ""How long, how long?"" Young sings, and he sounds like he's bawling. Simply maddening, the relevance of a song like this one (and also its follow-up, ""Alabama"") felt slightly more historical as recently as four years ago.    Having finally issued  Homegrown   this year, some 45 years after it was recorded, Young wraps up  The Times  with that album's ""Little Wing."" Hannah makes a brief appearance in the middle of the performance, as Young lets the song succumb to its fragility. Within its weathered frame, is a central tenet of this EP — that there is always hope in an American election year: ""Little wing, don't fly away / When the summer turns to fall / Don't you know some people say / The winter is the best time of them all?""

2020-09-17,Sarah Chodos,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Rich Aucoin Sonically Captures the Division of the 'United States',,"Rich Aucoin  has been known to sync his albums to movies so they can be used as alternate soundtracks. This time, the story he has created a soundtrack for is particularly unsettling and, unfortunately, real.  United States  is the story of America over the past four years.    Aucoin's work has always been eclectic and experimental, though the overall feeling can change from album to album. Perhaps  United States  is his most thunderous work to date. Electrical storms involve bodies of air clashing into each other; friction creating lightning and thunder. This is the sensation that comes from listening to  United States , where the heavy influences of soul and electronica crash. The choir's robust sound is juxtaposed with an electronic rhythm section. This points to the unignorable disparate solitudes within the United States — the music is not so much a fusion of genres as a collision.    In ""How It Breaks,"" about the current US president, the lyrics ""There is a ruler who wants all the power and it's gonna take all of our strength to stop them"" is set against a clanging rhythm that jumps from background to foreground; while it should be detracting from the lyrics, it actually commands a more devoted listen.  In ""Dopamine,"" the refrain ""all we have right now is here"" hearkens to gospel while backed by electronic music pulsing to a calculated beat.    On  United States , beauty and sadness, hope and pain are shown not to be mutually exclusive — the album demonstrates a jolting acknowledgement of reality combines with an electrifying hope of what could be.

Find the Sun  is her latest full-length record as  Deradoorian , and it marks an imposing shift in her sound — no longer floating and bright, the music on  Find the Sun  takes its title as a panicked demand, a journey through the long, lightless tunnels of the mind.    The record is subterranean and dank — pressurized to the point of suffocation, it takes the percussive drive of her debut (2015's  The Exploding Flower Planet ) and combines it with the hypnosis of 2017's hushed  Eternal Recurrence , crafting a restless and twilit world.  Find the Sun 's elusive moments of brightness — the unsettling acoustic glow of ""Waterlily,"" the ancient flutter of ""Monk's Robes"" — feel like emerging from beneath the earth and into vast windswept desert.    At its core,  Find the Sun  is motorik psych-rock, shot through with winding, primeval folk melodies. It's her most grounded record to date — more interested in exploring a weighty and heaving low-end than the towering, light-as-air harmonies she's grown famous for. The record's best songs — the driving, light-dappled ""Corsican Shores"" and the anxious forward tilt of ""Saturnine Night"" included — sound like they're hurtling away from some unknown danger.    The songs lock into grooves and tend to stay there — if you're partial to a given track's first few bars, it's likely you'll find yourself pleasantly lost in its magnetic repetitions. However, Deradoorian is a master of the hypnotic potential of a repeating sound, and  Find the Sun  rarely feels redundant. The small details that appear and pull away, the slowly building sense of momentum — these songs are made to be lost in and explored subconsciously.    That subconscious place remains an essential playing ground for Deradoorian — her lyrics focus on meditation and worlds both natural and beyond vision, of gloomy corners and the pursuit of light and self-fulfillment.  Find the Sun  is an uncompromising record from an artist intent on mining further depths, one that finds the beauty in unease — and a sense of purpose in the darkness.

Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism , the band's sixteenth studio LP and first since 2015's behemoth  Apex Predator – Easy Meat , is another solid addition to their brutal catalogue.    Napalm Death's unmistakable aggression is kept dynamic through rampant drums and guitars and fierce screams, barks and otherworldly chants. Opener ""Fuck the Factoid"" is violently epic, with chants and charging blasts. The aptly titled ""Backlash Just Because"" delivers auditory whiplash with death bellows and whirling and chugging riffs. Napalm Death, masters of their craft, still deal out some of the deadliest hooks in heavy music, like those found on ""Fluxing of the Muscle,"" ""Acting in Gouged Faith"" and ""That Curse of Being in Thrall,"" to name a few.    Sociopolitical lyrical themes wrapped in caustic and cryptic language stoke the Napalm Death firestorm on  Throes . Vocalist Barney Greenway often rips into songs like a raging bull coming out of the gates, and the rest of the band's inventiveness and intensity is always there to keep things interesting. Throughout the album, there are stylistic outliers that add some strange flavour to the collection, like the cavernous electro fury of ""Joie De Ne Pas Vivre,"" the stomping alt-metal groove of ""Amoral,"" the elongated grunts and mid-tempo grind of ""Invigorating Clutch,"" and the booming, twinkling and chant-laden closer ""A Bellyful of Salt and Spleen.""

2020-09-02,Matt Bobkin,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Bill Callahan Carves Out His Place Among the All-Time Greats on 'Gold Record',,"Bill Callahan  is a fantastic songwriter, but he cannot write himself into just anyone. His characters are wry and weary middle-aged men, aware of their limitations and increasingly at peace with them. In short, they're basically Callahan if two or three things were different, if he took a different profession or lived in a different neighbourhood, straddling the line between ""write what you know"" and escapist fantasy. On aging meditation ""35,"" the 54-year-old musician sings, ""I can't see myself in the books I read these days / Used to be I saw myself on every single page."" On  Gold Record , he limits himself to those ever-decreasing pages.    Despite this awareness, he still finds ways to challenge himself and succeed. On  Gold Record , Callahan's seventh album since abandoning his  Smog  moniker and coming only a year after  Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest , he forgoes the thematic links and recurring motifs of his most recent albums. Instead, he steps into the scuffed boots of his doppelgängers for a series of stripped-down narratives that find him wringing universal truths from increasingly specific reference points.     So much of Callahan's best work is about finding a place in the world, or at least trying to be at peace with the search, and  Gold Record  has him certainly finding success, though he doesn't always know it. Charming opening track ""Pigeons"" is ostensibly about a limo driver giving advice to a just-married couple, but bookended by invocations of two of 20th century songwriting's most lauded names: he kicks it off by intoning ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,"" and ends with a ""Sincerely, L. Cohen"" in his rich bass-baritone, which I swear gets impossibly deeper with each record, inching ever-closer to the two gravel-voiced icons he name-dropped. In his own way, it's Callahan wondering, with the cocked-eye curiosity that dots his work, if he's ready to sit at the big table with the best singer-songwriters — and he certainly is.    ​ Gold Record  features a loose collection of songs built around similarly loose instrumentation. Guitars squeak and strum, percussion is faint and soft, trumpets occasionally wail in the distance. There are no head-turning licks or subtle details that take away from Callahan's ever-deepening purr. And when Callahan is at his most outlandish and personable, he's able to draw out the most emotion, made all the more powerful in spite of the album's limited sonic palette. If Callahan's finding himself increasingly unable to relate to other characters, he's using his music to forge a different path, inviting his audience to stand in his place.    Whether telling the story of taking the place of his neighbour's deceased son at the dinner table in ""The Mackenzies,"" embodying a posturing boomer threatening an idealistic up-and-coming singer on ""Protest Song"" or inventing the name of a ""difficult yoga pose"" on ""Ry Cooder,"" Callahan is welcoming anyone who has ever felt lost, confused, uncertain or threatened into his humble abode, giving listeners the chance to learn, question or laugh — to challenge their notions and try something new in the hopes of discovering more about oneself.    But there's no better example of hearing the proof of Callahan having truly come into his own than on the impossibly relevant reimagining of ""Let's Move to the Country,"" the opening track from Smog's 1999 breakthrough,  Knock Knock . It not only comes at a time when urban centres worldwide have lost their beating hearts to gentrification and the pandemic, but it finds him finally able to articulate his full desires. Twenty-one years ago, his words got caught in his throat — ""Let's start a... / Let's have a...."" But now, he's got them: ""Let's start a family / Let's have a baby, or maybe two,"" sings Callahan, newly a family man. ""My travels are over, my travels are through / Let's move to the country, just me and you."" He's said it before, but now he finally means it.

Before either of them knew what was happening, the duo instantly became famous. As with almost everything at the beginning of the social media age, viral fame was something temporary; listeners from Europe and North America alike were infatuated with Yelle, but naturally assumed that Budet and Perrier would soon disappear, and the next big thing would come along.    Now, 15 years, three albums and three Coachella performances later, it's clear that Yelle is here to stay. Following a six-year break comes  L'Ère du Verseau  ( The Age of Aquarius ), which maintains the same addictive dance pop energy that made the duo go viral in the first place, but also showcases the wisdom, introspection and overall evolution of Yelle over the years.    The album opens up with ""Emancipense,"" a visceral, pulsating track with dark techno at its core. Things slow down with the following songs 'J'veux un chien' and 'Je t'aime encore,' as Julie Budet sings candidly about love and loss over intimate synth-infused instrumentals. Next is the intricate dance song 'Karaté'; despite having just one sentence as its lyric, Jean-François Perrier's production and Budet's flow and delivery keep things interesting and insanely catchy for its near three-minute length.     L'Ère du Verseau  is a conceptual rollercoaster, constantly picking up the tempo with exciting pop energy and then slowing everything down for moments of honest reflection.

2020-09-03,Kyle Mullin,8,"POP AND ROCK,MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Hannah Georgas's 'All That Emotion' Has the Bittersweet Beauty of a Late-Summer Heat Wave,,"If you could give your bygone self advice, what would you say?  Hannah Georgas  certainly knows. Through music that evokes both the nostalgia of muggy summer flings and encroaching autumn melancholy, the Canadian singer-songwriter empathetically and melodically moans to her prior incarnation: ""None of this matters though it hurts like hell,"" she sings on ""Same Mistakes."" Thanks to Georgas's vocals, the wincing guitar riffs, ticktock-fleeting-time percussion and downcast piano, this song amounts to a heartfelt and intricate highlight from her new LP,  All That Emotion .    The musical heft backing up her vivid yet minimalistic singing and lyrics throughout this can't-miss album comes courtesy of  Aaron Dessner . Prior to helming this album he made headlines for his production of  Taylor Swift 's recent smash,  folklore . However, his work here with Georgas is more in line with the heart wrenching, indie-rock sophistication of Dessner's first claim to fame, as co-founder of the debonairly brooding band  the National . Though pop hooks abound on  All That Emotion , Dessner takes great care to lace each note with emotional complexity and avant-garde technique.    And Georgas proves to be the perfect foil in that regard. Take  All That Emotion  highlight ""Easy"" which features rapidly pounding percussion akin to a car ignition desperately trying to start, as Georgas movingly elongates lines about being at a loss for words. It's all catchy enough to keep you humming long after the song finishes. The percussion and keys on ""Pray It Away,"" meanwhile, bubble up to the surface in irregular patterns that fittingly evoke Georgas's lyrics about frantic anxiety and strained hope. And the rhythm on ""Habits"" sways like a late-'80s pop-rock hit, which Georgas juxtaposes by singing about habitual romantic dysfunction.    She leaves so much room for relatable ambiguity. She imbues each line with a multitude of feeling. And she chooses a producer whose tone recreates the scalding sheen of a distant late-August heat wave. With all that and more, Georgas gives listeners the bittersweet beauty of recalling turning seasons and turning points on  All That Emotion .

2020-09-08,Jordan Currie,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Le Couleur Explore Death Through Dance on 'Concorde',,"With the end of summer approaching, Montreal-based electro-pop trio  Le Couleur  are closing it out with a more literal kind of end: death. Like the rest of their discography, Le Couleur's third album  Concorde  is jam packed with Francophone disco and synth-pop, but this time, it's laced with darker psychedelic rock, meatier baselines, epic instrumental breakdowns and morbid explorations.    The band's colourful synths and eclectic blend of vintage and modern sounds will have listeners wanting to twirl the night away on a lit-up dance floor — only to be left feeling like they've stumbled into a living nightmare when further inspecting the lyrical content. The album has a gentle grandeur about it, evident in Laurence Giroux-Do's soothing vocals alongside lengthy intricate instrumental segments on tracks like ""Désert"" and ""Comme une fin du monde"", an otherworldly highlight about the end of the world.    The album's title track (named after the plane involved in the 2000 Air France crash) is lush and steady, painting a picture of gazing out of an airplane window at the sunset, then cut through by voices ominously reading plane coordinates through a speaker. The layered, peppy vocals on ""Train de minuit"" are reminiscent of a long-lost ABBA song, and the band showcases their psychedelic stylings on sensual instrumental interlude ""Vol d'apres-midi"", with a slithering bass line.    Le Couleur have never shied away from big glamorous songs, but  Concorde  shows the band at their most ambitious, both in sound and in storytelling.

As with the first release,  Joshua Van Tassel 's new iteration shows the composer mostly eschewing pop elements, including the accessible beats of 2018's  Crossworlds . With  Dance Music Volume II , his classical proclivities are brought fully into the forefront, the entire sequence benefiting invaluably from the presence of the Venuti String Quartet (violinists Drew Jurecka and Rebekah Wolkstein, cellist Lydia Muchinsky and violist Shannon Knights).    The album opens with ""Muttering Spells,"" spacey minimalism segueing into dynamic fluctuations in volume, a sound at once ecstatic and meditative. ""Conjuror-er"" features an otherworldly refrain, a shimmering melodic line that recurs throughout the piece. The track expands texturally as it progresses, achieving symphonic heights.     ""Their Love Was Alive Before They Were Dead"" opens with crystalline piano, bringing to mind work by Ludovico Einaudi or Fabrizio Paterlini, simple melodies complemented by string arrangements and a synth soundscape. ""Shadows Smile for You"" features a confluence of basic melodic elements and digital accents. Comparisons to Brian Eno are inevitable; however, unlike Eno, Van Tassel is oriented almost exclusively toward the epic, archetypal and grandly metaphysical.    ""Their Hands on Their Hands"" features an evocative blend of primitive piano lines and viola, the ambient setting proliferating into a palimpsest of roily sonics. On ""Lost Without You,"" the album's closer, Van Tassel illustrates the process by which harmony, literally and metaphorically, often dissolves into discordancy and how, in turn, discordancy often resolves harmonically.     Dance Music Volume II  is an ambitious undertaking on the part of Van Tassel and his supporting musicians (again, the contributions of The Venuti String Quartet can't be overemphasized).  Volume II , like the series' first instalment, occurs as cosmic, etherial and celestial while remaining melodically and atmospherically tangible.  Volume II , however, brings to more consummate fruition the themes and approaches introduced on its predecessor. With both projects, one observes Van Tassel aspiring, albeit in contemporarily electronic fashion, to the loftiness of the Romantics, including Beethoven and Brahms.

2020-09-09,Manus Hopkins,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Marilyn Manson Isn't Shocking Anymore, but 'We Are Chaos' Proves His Staying Power",,"It's hard for an artist like  Marilyn Manson  to not been considered a has-been. The Antichrist Superstar made his name in the '90s as a shock icon, terrorizing parents and threatening their authority over the corruptible youth of America. But reputations like this seldom last, and eventually the  novelty of Manson's controversial status  wore off, leaving one question—does he have the staying power to remain relevant based on his music alone?    The past couple of decades have brought many ups and  downs  for Manson. Today, his days of dismantling civilization as we know it may be a thing of the past, but he's doing much better than he was 10 years ago, and he has a steady collection of recent albums to prove it.      We Are Chaos  is a logical and welcome next step for Manson. The record doesn't wholly rehash any of his past work, but isn't too much of a departure to sit nicely within his catalogue. Still, the album feels reminiscent of 1998's  Mechanical Animals , in a similar way to which 2017's  Heaven Upside Down  felt to 1996's  Antichrist Superstar . Opener ""Red, Black and Blue"" conjures up echoes of ""Great Big White World,"" and the title track contains hints of ""Coma White.""     We Are Chaos  is made up of equal parts ethereal, cacophonous and melancholy. Electronic-infused stomps and southern rock ballads may not sound on paper like they would fit well together, but the album manages to flow well, sacrificing only a little bit of cohesiveness to incorporate its variety of styles.     While it isn't without its duller moments, like the slow refuge of ""Half-Way & One Step Forward"" and the unfortunately underwhelming ""Solve Coagula,"" the record's highlights are arguably some of the strongest songs in the second half of Manson's discography. ""Don't Chase the Dead"" and ""Perfume"" are two of the most energetic songs Manson has released in years, and ""Paint You with My Love"" drips with raw emotion from start to finish.    While he may not be the pop culture figure he once was, Marilyn Manson is still capable of churning out some of modern rock music's finest work. It's probably safe to say there will never be another Marilyn Manson album quite up to the level of his work in the mid-to-late '90s, but he's succeeded in growing past his social pariah image, something not many other artists could do.

2020-09-09,Kyle Mullin,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC,HIP-HOP",Conway the Machine Hangs with Rap's Best on 'From King to a GOD',,"On ""Lemon,"" a key track from Conway the Machine's must-listen new album  From King to a GOD , the Buffalo, NY-based rapper abruptly shifts from detailing a criminal's sentencing to the ensuing collateral damage: ""Won't see his daughter graduate / Can't teach his son to drive."" As if such tender nuance (after bar upon bar of brawny inner city lore) wasn't enough to make the song special, ""Lemon"" is elevated all the more by a verse from  Wu-Tang  legend  Method Man . The Staten Island elder sounds a fraction of his 49 years here, thanks to his tangible enthusiasm at rhyming alongside the ascending Conway, whose rugged delivery owes no small debt to his Shaolin forefather. The brilliance of ""Lemon"" is sealed with a menacing instrumental replete with distortion and groaning bass samples, sharply contrasted with a tingling piano sample so shrill it doesn't so much evoke fingers on keys, but instead a chill running up your spine.    Method Man is by no means the only rap titan to eagerly hop on Conway's sure-to-be-breakout new LP. That lineup is rounded out by the likes  Havoc  of  Mobb Deep  (who lithely raps on and produces the string laden ""Juvenile Hell"" alongside a surprisingly not washed up Lloyd Banks). Iconic genre elder Erick Sermon of  EPMD , meanwhile, serves up a fuzzy synth-slathered instrumental on  From King to a GOD  closer ""Forever Droppin Tears.""  Freddie Gibbs  (arguably the most prolific and critically acclaimed MC of the moment) lends his hypnotically rhythmic flow and gruff voice to the melancholy, sing-song-y refrained ""Seen Everything but Jesus."" And Gibbs' recent cohort  Alchemist  (who produced the Indiana rapper's 2020 top tier release  Alfredo , on which Conway guested) lends his darkly minimalistic beatmaking to ""Dough & Damani.""    Having such a hip-hop who's-who on your features list certainly speaks volumes. But  From King to a GOD  impresses beyond those flourishes thanks to Conway's bedrock-hard vocals, tone and overall disposition throughout. His rhymes about police brutality on the Beat Butcha-produced highlight ""Front Lines,"" for instance, come close to reaching Killer Mike's unparalleled calls-to-arms on this summer's  RTJ4 .    Listeners will also be keen to catch Conway's lyrical curveballs, including a standout line on key track ""Spurs 3"" where he rhymes ""extortion"" with a diss about the ladies his rivals can't court. ""Spurs 3"" also shines thanks to contributions from Conway's inner circle: brother and fellow MC  Westside Gunn  and cousin and rapper  Benny the Butcher . Those rap relatives — the respective  Ghostface  and  RZA  to Conway's Method Man, respectively — bring enough combustable chemistry to not only satisfy their Griselda cult following, but also to convert novices who have slept on the burgeoning Buffalo clique for too long. Such criminally uninitiated masses will no doubt dwindle before long, judging by the sterling quality and stacked features list of  From King to a GOD  (and other simmering recent releases from Griselda). Indeed, listening to Conway's latest is hearing the sound of an underground king ascend to the status of the esteemed guest artists he attracts.

With  Truth and Ruin , the band have taken their collective experience and put together a catchy and anthemic stoner metal record that opens the band up to a wider audience than ever before.    Truthfully, this record is meant to be heard in a live setting. The vocal harmonies on ""Forever Unsung"" and ""Sound and Fury"" would be best experienced in a large amphitheater with the audience belting out the lyrics. Even on songs with dark subject matter, like title cut ""Truth and Ruin,"" memorable choruses reign supreme.    The instrumentation on  Truth and Ruin  is full of groove and swing. With everything from the drum patterns on ""Atoned Deaf"" and ""Partial Darkness"" to the guitar rhythms on ""Forever Unsung,"" Dead Quiet have traded in headbanging for more of a dance feel. Even the guitar solos on ""Truth and Ruin"" are more akin to '70s rock swagger.    Dead Quiet's  Truth and Ruin  will not be for those staunchly rooted in heavy music stereotypes. This record perfectly balances its dark subject manner with the levity in its instrumentation, and yet still packs enough riffs to tied over fans of older material.  Truth and Ruin  won't be fully appreciated until we can hear it material in a live setting.

""Books and cinema have always been integral to my life, and that is often because of how I relate to the themes and characters therein,"" said frontman Michael Berdan in a press release. ""I am naturally shy and terrified of being misunderstood. This time around, I endeavored to trudge through those fears in order to explicitly articulate what goes on in a dreary corner of my inner life. To put it plainly: I was in a dark place.""    From start to finish,  Shame  is heavily rooted in this dark place that Berdan describes. It is an exploration of the demented, self-immolating human psyche, both in Berdan's lyrics and the brutal layers of noise layered upon each track. Listening to  Shame  is a gut-wrenching and extremely visceral experience, and for this reason, it is the best album Uniform has put out to date.    It is not without a purpose that the album opens with Berdan repeatedly howling the phrases ""You are what you've done"" and ""You are what's been done to you,"" in ""Delco."" Lyrically, Berdan is investigating the way that being mistreated affects an individual's worldview, forcing them to make bad decisions of their own. This, along with Ben Greenberg's distorted guitar riffs and new addition Mike Sharp's incendiary drums, makes the impact absolutely eviscerating.    Whereas most of the songs on  Shame  feature slow buildups and pure, unadulterated dread, ""Dispatches from the Gutter"" stands out for being relentlessly fast-paced for the entirety of its two-minute play time. Yet, in both its faster moments and its slower ones, Uniform pay close attention to details both big and small that make  Shame  relistenable.    The album's final song, ""I Am the Cancer,"" is a satisfying eight-minute combination of ambient drones and intense death metal breakdowns; to close the album, it feels more than appropriate that Berdan uses his signature guttural vocal style to wail the words, ""God is war / War endures."" He is adopting the character of ""The Judge"" from Cormac McCarthy's novel  Blood Meridian  — somebody who has sinned past the point of no return, and one of the most despicable and shameful characters in literary history.     Shame  is not only hard to listen to, but also hard to swallow and hard to digest. It thought-provoking music which is guaranteed to make listeners feel uncomfortable in their own skin; what more could you want from a new Uniform album?

2020-09-11,Dylan Kavalsky,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Figure Walking Push Their Two-Piece Setup to the Max on 'Vertical / Horizontal',,"Canadian rock duo  Figure Walking 's newest record,  Vertical / Horizontal , delivers straight-ahead indie rock with a pinch of roots music, making it strongly reminiscent of  the Tragically Hip . While it does not knock down the walls of the genre, it plays well within them.    Like  the White Stripes  and  the Black Keys  before them, Figure Walking are a stripped-down two-piece: Rob Gardiner bangs the drums, while singer Greg MacPherson noodles with the baritone guitar and keys. Their range of instruments is limited, but their range of sounds is not. The guitar tone, for instance, is hazy on ""Heavy Rain,"" fuzzy on ""Indonesia,"" and thrillingly abrasive on ""Freaking.""    Meanwhile, Gardiner pummels every part of the kit to deliver several interesting beats; they range from being straightforward on songs like ""Silver Glow"" and ""Paradise"" to intricate on songs like ""Mr. X"" and ""Freaking.""    The well-mixed instrumentation is complemented by MacPherson's high-pitched and meaty vocals. They have an echo effect to them, making it sound like MacPherson is preaching from a podium. They also take a stylistic detour on parts of ""In It to Win It,"" the catchiest song on the album, where they digress into rhythmic and mesmerizing mumbling.    The lyrics do not shy away from some of the darker themes of modern life, providing an interesting contrast to the positive vibes of the music itself.    There are some repetitive melodies on songs like ""Colourful,"" ""Silver Glow,"" and ""Gold Coins."" For this reason, Vertical / Horizontal isn't consistently engaging. However, it is still the kind of album you could thoroughly enjoy on a weekend road trip with the windows rolled down, as you breathe in the last remnants of summer.

This music evokes images of walking up and down a familiar street, looking for a job, an apartment, or just something interesting to do on a street you have walked many times.    This music explores the idea of home — not completely in the warm sense, nor in the sense of desperately needing to escape, but of being suspended in a kind of limbo. Though the production quality is high, there is a certain basement sound to it, too.     This City  opens with ""Keep Kicking,"" which sets the tone with its slow and yet strong and steady electronic beat, combining high-pitched piano notes with low, rumbling vocal harmonies. The final track, ""Easily"", is a lovely acoustic guitar number, and the lyrics ""We could drive until the sunset turns to ash"" accompany the feel of the music and the overall sentiment of the album.    Both ""This City"" and ""Driveway Moment"" are piano-driven — not quite as dramatic as  Billy Joel , but there is a hint of that classic sound.    There is this sense throughout the album that the tempo is about to speed up and the adrenaline is about to flow freely but that never quite happens. Interspersing the slow songs with some faster ones — akin to Cash's old band,  the Romantic Dogs  — might have made the album more appealing, but it also might have changed the sentiment.    The refrain for title track ""This City"" goes, ""If this city keeps pushing me out, I'd like to see it live without me."" It's like a frustrated love song — only involving a place, rather than a person.

Like a dusty old vinyl gem you find in a thrift shop bargain bin, Wall's music is the product of another time. It's a tip of the cap to the classic, unadorned country and western of legendary artists like  Hank Williams , Hank Snow,  Stompin' Tom Connors  and early Johnny Cash with perhaps a folksy sprinkling of  Kris Kristofferson  for good measure. Wall is an old soul and he knows it — he plays that card very well.    Kicking off with ""Western Swing & Waltzes,"" it's clear that Wall's unique voice is an acquired taste, with quavering vibrato and deep baritone, with the lyrical approach of Sons of the Pioneers and a minimalist instrumental pallet. While the several tracks that make use of a full band are also very enjoyable, Wall's sound works best when he sticks to a ""less is more"" approach, like on standouts ""I Ride An Old Paint/Leavin' Cheyenne,"" featuring acoustic guitar and harmonica, and ""Diamond Joe,"" adds some fiddling to the mix.   .

2020-08-28,Francesca Rose,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Corridor's Jonathan Personne Mines Decades of Rock History on Solo Album 'Disparitions',,"There is a distinctive style that circulates the work of  Jonathan Personne . Known as the frontman of Montreal's  Corridor , his music is submerged in an '80s pop punk gloominess with echoing vocals and luscious melancholy.  Disparitions , Personne's second solo album, follows in the same vein but with enough variation and textures that the listener is taken on a journey.    ""Springsteen,"" the lead single, has a toe-tapping ambience mixed with the general lo-fi sound. It's an exploration into emotions felt while on tour: missing home, and the mixed feelings of reluctance that can come with continuous time on the road. It's followed by ""Dernier train,"" a laid-back '70s rock vibe with a sun-soaked instrumental passage at the end. Nature sounds are incorporated, those reminiscent of birds chirping in flocks, making the overall atmosphere freeing and positive.    The brightness of the instrumentation and the dark moodiness of the vocals is a juxtaposition that makes  Disparitions  intriguing. ""Dans la chambre"" is like hazy light or a soft breeze seeping through an open window, while ""Signs de vie"" is calming and atmospheric. The title track is sparse and whimsical, impatient strumming combined with wandering electric guitar and touches of violin. It's like being alone in the countryside or wilderness, hills and mountains in view, while Personne's vocals enforce that haunting distance.    On the other hand, the opening track ""Personne"" consists of echoing distorted vocals and crashing guitars, which, put simply, are like noise and perhaps representative of chaos within the mind. The contrast, however, is felt most with ""Grand soleil"" and ""Au final."" The former is slow and melancholic, and there's a real rawness that brings out a rare sense of intimacy. Yet, when the latter begins, the listener is immediately returned to the classic-sounding guitars and distortion.    Closing track, ""Evidemment,"" fittingly sums up the record. It's wistful and a little dramatic, with dark sonic undertones mixed with a hopefulness that's all predominantly led by sound. While all the songs are in French, there's a lack of clarity to the lyrics' projection that means even French speakers may have to listen carefully to understand.    Overall, there isn't anything unique about the  Disparitions , especially in comparison to the rest of Jonathan Personne's work. Instead it's a taking of a variety of familiar elements of recent eras that connote a musical coolness and redelivering them in the context of Francophone music.

In this way,  Mama, You Can Bet!  represents her most integrated, expansive and multifaceted release to date.    The album opens with the title cut, Muldrow immediately demonstrating her musical versatility, a bouncy bass well-blended with swing-y piano and percussion parts. Her vocal is both whimsical and world-weary as she sings, ""Mama, don't you fret / I know love is waiting around the corner."" On ""Bop for Aneho,"" Muldrow blends elegant rhythms with a seductive welter of free-jazz melodies and wafting ambient sounds.    With ""Our Joy (Mercedes),"" Muldrow crafts a moody palimpsest of vocal parts alternately reminiscent of  Nina Simone  and  Macy Gray . The bass-driven ""Ra's Noise"" sounds at times rootsy, at times spacey, the addition of Lakecia Benjamin's sax part (the only instrument on the album that Muldrow doesn't play) bringing to mind  Kamasi Washington 's explorations on 2015's  The Epic .    Muldrow tackles two  Charlie Mingus  compositions, offering a rollicky and occasionally psychedelic iteration of ""Bemoanable Lady"" (here titled ""Bemoanable Lady Geemix Fonk"") and a funky, bass-heavy response to ""Fables of Faubus"" (here titled ""Fabus Foo Gemix""). With both songs, Muldrow is attuned to the original structures, refrains and energy, adding distinctly contemporary, hip-hop-inflected and experimental touches.    The watery ""Skippin and Trippin"" illustrates Muldrow's appreciation for  Thelonious Monk , while ""Swing Kirikou, Swing"" is a staccato, funk-flooded and incendiary take that brings to mind  Herbie Hancock 's  Head Hunters . ""Hard Bap Duke"" also mines jazz-funk and jazz-fusion templates, replete with a wiry bass part and expansive synth sounds.    ""This Walk"" features Muldrow's vocal swaddled in reverb, a sultry track with a hummable melody. The album ends with ""The Cowrie Waltz,"" a fertile mix of quirky beats and melodic sketches, Muldrow improvising with noise elements that wouldn't be out of place on a  Deerhunter  album.     Mama, You Can Bet!  highlights Muldrow's encyclopedic knowledge of jazz, hip-hop, funk, R&B and soul, making for a stylistically eclectic album. The 15-song sequence, however, is eminently cohesive, each track building on or seemingly responding to the previous one. With  Mama, You Can Bet! , Muldrow showcases her consummate talents, affirming herself as one of the stellar jazz and jazz-related musicians and composers of her generation.

Now, the Oakland trio, featuring members of  Vastum  and Mortuous, return with their anticipated sophomore album,  Mortal .    This album bears some of the same traits of a good jazz recording. The tone of the guitars is warm and well-rounded, the rhythm section is very ""in the pocket,"" and the subtle syncopation in the accented notes gives it a laid-back feel even when it's firing on all cylinders — which it is most of the time. ""Your Hell"" kicks things off with ripping guitars spewing out a surgically sinister melody, its abstract evil alluding to the European sensibilities informing  Mortal . The seductively strange melodies of this album are its lifeblood, leading to its most memorable moments like the Swedeath-infused ""Asleep Forever."" There's also plenty of  Bolt Thrower  influence in the pummelling ""Stench of Decay"" and ""Sinister Will.""    There's some sounds from American death metal as well, particularly in ""Dying Life"" and ""Malevolent Intentions,"" with riffs reminiscent of  The Bleeding -era  Cannibal Corpse . The best product of American influence on this album, however, is in the solo sections, which are similar to  Death  in their attention to composition and harmony.    If Necrot had dug a little deeper into their American repertoire, they might have come up with the missing piece of this album: rhythmic variation. While this album has a great sense of melody, it lacks any rhythmic stabs to make songs stand out. As a result, many songs are stuck on full-throttle and, by the end, the album feels formulaic.    On  Mortal , Necrot continue to hone their old-school edge, carving out a reeking slab of death crawling with parasitic melodies. While it may not blow your mind, it's enough to bang your head to.

2020-08-28,Alex Whetham,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Ulver Finally Carve Out a Niche with Their '80s Synthpop Style on 'Flowers of Evil',,"For the first time in their career, exploratory Norwegian group  Ulver  have followed up a record with another one in the same style. The band has become known for their disinterest in following a specific style, releasing albums in eclectic genres like black metal, trip-hop and art rock, among others.    And while  Flowers of Evil  follows pretty faithfully in the footsteps of the band's 2017 record,  The Assassination of Julius Caesar , this ends up working in the band's favour. Singer Krystoffer Rygg's voice suits the dark  Depeche Mode -esque synthpop style the group tackled on that record, and on  Flowers of Evil , they harness it to create a catchier, more concise and overall better album.    Lead single ""Russian Doll"" in particular stands out as a highlight, with its arpeggiated synthesizers, driving drum machine and gothic delivery from Rygg meshing to form one of the group's better and most accessible songs to date. While the danceable drums throughout the entire record can at times border on cheesy (see the guitar-backed disco romp ""Machine Guns and Peacock Feathers""), they are no more cheesy than any genuine '80s synthpop song they're paying tribute to.    Ulver doesn't do anything to push the synthpop sound they pursue out of its comfort zone and this keeps the album from greatness, but  Flowers of Evil  stands out as the band's most accessible album to date. There's no shortage of memorable moments to be found here, and while it is unknown if this ""dark '80s-synthpop"" Ulver will continue from here, this album proves that they've hit a sound they could reasonably pull from for the remainder of their career.

2020-08-28,Matt Yuyitung,7,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC",Heaps Search for an Identity on Promising 'What Is Heaps',,"What exactly is  Heaps ? While the album title here isn't explicitly a question, it's still something worth asking. The band formerly known as  the Kents  have a new name, a new record and a brand new identity. In many ways, it's a fresh start for the Ontario band, as they trade in much of their upbeat indie pop approach from their Kents days for a more introspective and exploratory art rock style. Here, Heaps embrace an expanded sonic palette, more mature lyricism and ultimately a big step forward as a band.    Looking back on their EPs as the Kents, this reinvention doesn't seem particularly shocking. Older tracks off  Within Waves  like ""Distant"" and ""Is There Anyone?"" foreshadow the dense soundscapes and production flourishes on  What Is Heaps  tracks like ""Softly"" or ""Hazy Shores."" Their pop smarts still remain, as seen on ""You Were Here"" or ""So Soon,"" and some of their strengths like Warren Frank's vocals and a great rhythm section continue to drive the band forward.    With this kind of change in direction, growing pains are almost inevitable, and  What Is Heaps  is no exception. The record lacks the consistently strong songwriting and the confidence of their past EPs, but that can be easily forgiven given the band's position in uncharted territory. While  What Is Heaps  doesn't quite have the staying power of the group's strongest material, it will be interesting to see where they end up as they continue to evolve.    What is Heaps is a record from a group in the midst of change. It's the sound of a band growing in real time, complete with all the ups and downs of redefining its core sound. It has its hits and it has its misses, but it's still growth in the end.

2020-08-28,Adam Feibel,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Dikembe Remind Emo Fans That It's Okay to Be Sad on 'Muck',,"Mr. Hooper was one of the most beloved characters on  Sesame Street . Cranky and curmudgeonly but with a heart of gold, he was beautifully portrayed by Will Lee since the TV series premiered back in 1969. He became the most recognizable human character on the show, and his corner store was a neighbourhood hub for the Muppets and humans living in harmony. Mr. Hooper had a particularly close relationship with Big Bird.    When Lee died suddenly in late 1982, the writers and producers of  Sesame Street  chose not to recast him, nor to tell its young viewers that Mr. Hooper retired or moved away. Instead, they took the opportunity to write an episode to teach children about death. In the episode, the innocent, naïve Big Bird acts as the audience surrogate; the patient, supportive adults have to explain why Mr. Hooper is gone, and why he's never coming back. It's an incredibly moving scene, and a defining moment for  Sesame Street .    That same struggle to understand and accept the harsh realities of life and death is the focus of  Muck , the fourth album by Florida emo veterans  Dikembe . These songs are knotty and sticky, clogged with anxious thoughts and anxious riffs as singer and guitarist Steven Gray lives with the lingering effects of the loss of his mother. Combining the hammer hits of  In Utero  and  Dirt  with the creakiest floorboards in the fourth-wave emo mansion,  Muck  finds Dikembe bending their genre to meet the messiness of their minds. ""Why swim when you can sink?"" Gray asks. In contrast, Dikembe's first EP in 2011 was full of fun: It was called  Chicago Bowls , all the song titles were weed-themed puns on the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls roster, and it sampled an endearing scene from  Freaks and Geeks . The band's lyrical content has long been the definition of emo — depressed, self-pitying, melodramatic — but early on, there was a youthful pep to their music. Here, it feels weighted. ""Parked my ass in a van / Where I sat around, thought about death and shit / Then it all got sick,"" Gray sings in the grimy groove of ""All Got Sick.""    On Dikembe's last two albums — 2014's  Mediumship  and 2016's  Hail Something  — they were working on a cool new sound, but hadn't quite figured out how to make memorable songs out of it.  Muck  finds them settling nicely into this identity, mixing in a sprinkling of the emo-punk jangle of their early years while expanding their grungy post-hardcore sound with newly added piano and string arrangements. ""Stay Beat"" recalls the dense, grungy alt-rock of  Balance and Composure , ""Old Husks"" waltzes with the Americana tinge of  Into It. Over It. , and several songs feel a bit like listening to  Science Fiction  guilt-free. While the album can often feel crushing and claustrophobic, the album gradually reveals its emotional range, especially with ""Perfect Mess."" That depth comes into full view with the arresting closer, ""Leveled Again.""    In the aforementioned  Sesame Street  episode, Big Bird is helped through his crisis and begins to accept the loss of his friend. ""Leveled Again"" samples a clip of that scene, but the dialogue cuts off at the height of his anguish: ""I don't understand. You know, everything was just fine. Why does it have to be this way?"" The band then pick slides into a huge finale with a skyscraping guitar solo, and closes it out with three minutes of  Hammock -esque closing credits. Gray has set his voice aside to let the instrumentals tell the end of the story, and it's an ending that sounds pained but hopeful. While Dikembe's debut,  Broad Shoulders , remains an underrated gem of the ""emo revival,""  Muck  is arguably their defining moment — their vision for a complete, thematically driven and sonically stimulating album stronger now than ever. The lesson: it's okay to be sad. Just take it from  Sesame Street .

In  Seastones: Set 4 and Set 5 , pieces from the original release are combined with unreleased material from the studio sessions. The result is an exceptional and timeless reissue that feels right at home in the modern age.    The tracks, simply titled by number, feature long languid musical shapes that would find comfort on far away moons, synced melodic generative stepped patterns hatched in the labs of sound scientists and eerie modulated voice compositions (performed by a host of well-known artists, including  Jerry Garcia ). The album as a whole conveys a very minimalist approach to sound design with the empty space as much of a part of the compositions as the frequencies that interrupt it. Like his contemporary  John Cage , who perfected the use of the atmosphere in which the pieces were played (or not played, in some cases), Ned Lagin's soundscapes evolve based on the noise happening in the room the moment they are being observed: a passing airliner, the sound of a distant lawn mower or the constant buzzing of the fridge easily stroll alongside  Seastones , slightly altering the way they are perceived.    Lagin's artistic pedigree runs deep. He is an accomplished photographer, painter and musician who played alongside the  Grateful Dead . His  Seastones  collections is a testament to the longevity and relevance of his work, and the reissue is another classic in a growing list of excellent experimental and avant-garde music being brought back to life.

2020-09-01,Chris Bryson,6,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Sprain's 'As Lost Through Collision' Is a Lesson in Patience and Punishment for Those Willing to Endure,,"Los Angeles experimental rockers  Sprain  make bleak and knotty music that pays in catharsis. Their new album,  As Lost Through Collision , combines elements of noise rock, slowcore, post-rock, post-hardcore and doom into a challenging mix.    Opener ""Slant"" starts with bursts of fiery guitar squall and pummeling drums before slowing in stages down to chiming notes, reminiscent of those found on  Slint 's  Spiderland , and segues through with droning vocals and hazy, serrated guitars. ""Worship House"" builds off a simple, fuzzy riff into buzzing post-hardcore surge, then slows down to wobbly guitar lines and the album's most notable hooks and melodies, which bloom elegantly and are, true to Sprain form, off-kilter and laced with unease, punctuated by sporadic screams.    ""Everything"" starts off deceptively, given what follows. A crystalline guitar melody rings with a groovy, lurching rhythm. Then the guitars and drums crank things up briefly, then it's back to the groove. Then things get cranked up for voluminous twanging and chiming. Vocals move from speaking to screaming, and three and a half minutes into the over-fifteen-minute-long track, it transitions into a noise-doom epic. For some people, this may or may not be a good thing, as it can be akin to a lesson in patience, punishment and feedback. Closer ""Constant Hum"" moves through plodding drums and discordant guitars with morose vocals that slowly build into clamorous bursts.    While there are hooks and melodies throughout, for some people, it may not be enough to counterbalance the lulls and onslaughts that occupy a good portion of the album. But for those who love prolonged auditory ebbs and flows of tension and catharsis with an experimental bent,  As Lost Through Collision  will do just fine.

2020-09-01,Chris Gee,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Lomelda's 'Hannah' Reminds Listeners That Loneliness Can Be Complicated,,"At its core,  Lomelda  is a project about shyness – that it's okay to feel it, how to embrace it, and laying it all out to be examined in its primary elements. Over the last few years, Hannah Read has sang about introversion in simple terms, and her latest album continues to showcase her no-fuss, contemplative songwriting. Fittingly named after herself,  Hannah  is taken straight from the mind of a wallflower, apprehensive and always low-key.    Whether she is quite literally questioning her own happiness in ""Hannah Happiness"" or dealing with the act of sharing feelings with others in ""Stranger Sat by Me,"" Read awakens the overwhelming feeling of second-guessing choices or misremembering a specific experience. On the wired ""Reach,"" Read's murmuring whimper soars as she wonders, ""So confused who I have been, who I haven't – outta habit now,"" over low humming guitars and a homely, cushioned drumbeat.    Though she moved to Los Angeles, Read recorded  Hannah  in her small Texan hometown of Silsbee, where you can practically hear the tumbleweeds punctuating her thoughts. The lightly strummed ""Polyurethane"" and ""Big Shot"" follow a similar vain to her very succinct album from last year,  M for Empathy , where Read focuses on small moments of grief in so few words.    In contrast, ""Tommy Dread"" and ""Hannah Sun"" have remarkable full-band arrangements, carefully fanned out with reedy acoustic guitars and Read's quavering voice attentively rounded into memorable melodies. On the wordless ""Both Mode,"" Read unleashes distorted, swerving guitars in a move that shows her ability to be loud when she needs to. Explosive lead single ""Wonder""  swells with shrinking guitars and Read's triumphant repeated refrain to herself: ""When you get it, give it all you got, you said.""    On  Hannah , Read occasionally mucks up any coziness she builds up – hey, it's complicated to feel lonely sometimes.

His résumé includes  Goosebump  and  Ducks Unlimited , and he also previously released  Young, Healthy, and Wonderful  under his current moniker of  Elrichman . On  Heaven's Mayor , Erlichman is joined by like-minded talent from  Fucked Up ,  Hooded Fang ,  Alvvays ,  Weaves  and Twisted Pine.    Erlichman's other projects, as well as those of his current collaborators, are all unique and idiosyncratic in different ways, but  Heaven's Mayor  is possibly the purist expression of his fiercely independent sensibility. Throughout  Heaven's Mayor , the music keeps setting out on a path of '80s indie and jangle rock but then it turns sharply anytime it runs the risk of becoming catchy. Earlier avant-garde and later experimental influences push up from underneath to accompany a faint breeze of futuristic jazz.    The intentionally overblown orchestral arrangements on the opening track, ""Cop on a Horse,"" make it simultaneously beautiful and jarring. ""On the Nose"" features stunning flute by Anh Phung of Twisted Pine. ""Seeking Grey Skies"" is somewhat reminiscent of  Boney M . Of course, the lyrics for ""I Mostly Consume"" are consistent with the theme of consumerism, and then ""Burn It All Down"" laments, ""If you can afford it, it is nice to drift away, and if you can't afford it, I hope you can anyway."" Elrichman's endearing and straightforward lyrical sensibility sets off any possibility of pretentiousness.    This is the interesting work of skilled musicians, and listeners can appreciate it for what it is, not for measurement with any preconceived notions of what it should be.

2020-08-25,Daniel Sylvester,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC","Kelly Lee Owens's Emotional 'Inner Song' Is About the Journey, Not the Destination",,"While many musicians have created works thematically based on their environment, it's almost always presented as a self-serving expedition, as artists tend to focus on their own experiences, perspectives and worldview. But what makes  Inner Song  so original stems from Kelly Lee Owens's ability to seemingly use ecological and geographical themes in a wholly objective manner, describing the natural world almost as a non-participant.    Written during what Owens has described as ""the hardest three years of (her) life,"" the Welsh musician gives her sophomore LP an arm's length of coolness, at the same time fully letting go and allowing each track to move towards its own unprompted direction.    This distant/intimate theme is established immediately when it is revealed that Owens has opened her 10-track/50-minute LP with a cover ""Arpeggi,"" the second half of 2007 track ""Weird Fishes/Arpeggi"" by  Radiohead — an a band for whom Kelly has professed a deep admiration.    The yin/yang of ""On"" sees a well-structured vocal ballad crash up against an adventurous techno second half that nearly falls of the rails, while the cavernous beats of ""Melt!"" curiously samples melting glaciers but also comes off like a some sort of party anthem. The dirge-like and pulsating ""Corner of My Sky"" celebrates Owen's Welsh heritage but uses spoken-word vocals from guest  John Cale  just to keep it one step removed from her own experiences, while the gorgeous trance track ""Night"" explores the energy brought on by nightfall while keeping a sleepy vibe.    In some ways,  Inner Song  resembles a Thomas Pynchon novel, conveying deep emotion without ever accounting for it — but Owen's second album is nonetheless a triumph of soundscapes, an album not meant to analyze and decipher but to daydream, sleepwalk and stargaze through.

With lyrics that often sound sung into a fan,  The Walk  pits Molander's pinner-thin voice against itself, stacked into baroque and Babelesque doo-wops that recall a certain group of Liverpudlians from the '60s. The self-harmonies get a brotherly hand from Molanders Jake and Conner (the latter of  Half Moon Run ), who hum to Tom's drum and play Rhodes, pedal steel, and electric guitar.    The album's indisputable highlight is ""Third Walk,"" a slow sizzler that starts like Chardonnay and erupts mid-song like a smuggled fistful of Roman candles — a synth alights, its minor-key squeal a harbinger of chaos to come. The soft-n-pretty key ditties disappear. the drums pick up. The bass guitar starts rumbling like a bumptious, freaky psychotic. More psychedelic madness piles up in the melody and you can picture kids in the pit gleefully swinging, pointy elbows untucked.    The album swims against most current acts in ""Montreal rock"": it lacks the ironic proggy-inflection you'd expect of  Lydia Képinski  and her ilk, the nightingale polish of  Half Moon Run , or that swaggering post-punk  Corridor  cool. It instead plants its flag firm with ol' fusty  Nilsson ,  Ringo , and  the Kinks . A path so familiar-seeming, it's perhaps no longer actually trodden.

Following 2018's monstrous  Head Cage , Pig Destroyer's newest EP,  The Octagonal Stairway , features three previously released tracks and three B-sides that present the devastating dichotomy between the band's leanings towards full-on grindcore assault and crushing slower tunes.    The EP's first half includes the faster and ferocious previously released tracks. Opener ""The Octagonal Stairway"" features a brief noise intro that quickly explodes into mania with meaty riffs and relentless blasts helmed by J.R. Hayes's fierce screams. ""The Cavalry"" is a viciously rampant, whirling assault, while ""Cameraman"" boasts those Pig Destroyer moments where the guitar and drums dance frantically around each other in beautiful chaos.      The second half of the album gives the sense of impending doom and gets strange in the process. Sounds of flipping through channels opens the brief but forceful ""News Channel 6,"" before heavy drums and grinding power electronics come crashing in around a newscaster's voice, who greets America and then proceeds to list off terrible things like it's any other day. ""Head Cage"" features eerie spoken word recordings and rickety, squelching sounds overlaid with quivering alien hums and backgrounded by a simple drum beat.    Closer ""Sound Walker"" is a pulsing beast. The over-11-minute track transitions through interspersed spoken word recordings that become increasingly demonic and electronic percussion that builds through repetitive beats into an industrial groove that's eventually replaced by a cavern of creaking metal, otherworldly echoes and immense electric pulses.

The birth of Knight's first child, his choice to quit drinking and a significant move all drive the stripped-down reflections on his most concise record to date.    Here, Knight's trademark vulnerability is showcased as shamelessly as ever, but much of the hazy melodrama which ebbs and flows in his previous work is traded for a more streamlined approach. The power of emotive lyricism is amplified by a minimalistic instrumental backdrop, making the album's moments of orchestral intricacy all the more powerful.

Every song depicts a lover who is unattainable in a different way, whether through distance, a failure to let go, or celebrity. She displays this longing as both her own and something that many have experienced in their early adult bedrooms.    In the music video for the title track, she daydreams and plays guitar in her apartment decorated with memorabilia and trinkets. She's upfront about her love for the one she ""met on the radio,"" and doesn't make it a secret that she's probably writing about Robert Smith. Not-so-subtly showing off her ""Just Like Heaven"" ankle tattoo while putting on her shoes, she returns to the curly black-haired mystery man in her notebook.

This allows her emotionally honest lyrics to shine through. Through her vulnerability, she flaunts her femininity and infatuation as points of identity and strength.

The potency of Toots Hibbert's material is evidenced by the presence of his classic tune ""Pressure Drop"" in a current TV beer commercial. No single track on  Got to Be Tough  matches up to that song, but this is a solid offering from the 77-year-old.    Opening cut ""Drop Off Head"" sets the stage, featuring a tougher groove than you might expect, and boosted by I-Threes-style style female backing vocals and horns. Toots' voice remains warm and welcoming, with a hint of raspiness. This full-blooded sound serves as the album's template, with the more laidback feel of ""Good Thing That You Call,"" the upbeat and ska-accented ""Having a Party,"" and the rocksteady vibe of ""Warning Warning"" (an album highlight) providing a welcome change of pace. Hibbert produced and arranged the horns skilfully, while high-profile guests include Zak Starkey on guitar, Sly Dunbar on drums and Cyril Neville on percussion.    As  Got to Be Tough 's title suggests, the lyrical focus here is on survival in a troubled era. ""Living in this time it ain't so easy to carry on"" is the lament of ""Got to Be Tough,"" while ""Struggle"" pleads, ""We've got to stop the fighting, the shooting and killing."" The inclusion of a cover of the  Bob Marley  classic ""Three Little Birds,"" featuring guest vocals from  Ziggy Marley , smacks of a marketing ploy, but Hibbert mixes up the tune enough to keep things interesting. It's nice to have him back.

On Blais's debut album,  Below the Salt , she captures the essence of growing up and self-doubt. Blais emerges from the uncertain times she sings about, and the anxiety of her songs are relayed with confidence. Although the album was released on Blais's 26th birthday, she assures us that she doesn't have everything figured out.     Since the release of Blais's 2018 EP,  Let Yourself Go , the Vancouver-based artist has garnered listeners who are fond of her bedroom-pop songs and quirky personality. On  Below the Salt , Blais levels up, giving listeners what they want, while solidifying her voice as a musician. The album, co-produced by indie-pop duo  Tennis  and singer-songwriter  Louise Burns , is confident in its delivery.     In tandem with Blais's wispy voice,  Below the Salt  features bouncy piano chords, gentle guitar riffs and punchy drums that emphasize her experiences. On opening track ""Someone Called While You Were Out,"" Blais sings about trying to live up to the idealized version of herself to a buzzing drum beat. From the  Stevie Nicks -esque sound of ""Firestarter"" to ""Be Your Own Muse""'s heartfelt sentiment and luscious instrumental on ""Be Your Own Muse,"" Blais continues to captivate her audience with each track.     Blais' music has always been dreamy, yet her lyrics come from reality: ""But waiting is no way to live a life / It only left a scar / Doubted every single part,"" she coos on ""Ready or Not."" By the final track, ""So Funny,"" Blais accepts her flaws and laughs about them, seemingly synonymous with a sense of growth: ""No missing pieces here yet I went running / But I was wrong and so I guess the joke's on me.""    On  Below the Salt , Blais continues to translate her relatability into melodic indie-pop songs, and proves she is anything but salty towards life.

Following up 2017 EP  Dare to Care , the London, UK-based queercore band are coming full-force after dropping singles like the fiery ""Vagina Police"" and bass-heavy ""Jillian"" earlier this year. Dream Nails are reminiscent of  Bikini Kill , the sound of the '90s riot grrrl movement, but carry a modern flair.    Their album opens with ""Affirmations (Skit),"" a raw, inviting introduction to the band as they remind us that they're tired of being told by society what they're supposed to do as women. As the album progresses, the group do what they know — shouting their values and giving their middle fingers to the patriarch and anyone else who gets in their way.      At 16 tracks,  Dream Nails  seems lengthy at first glance, but each track is punchy and goes by quickly. The band put down their armour on ""Swimming Pool,"" a dreamy song about being with someone you like, while ""Kiss My Fist"" challenges men's view of female sexuality with wailing vocals and a strong guitar. The DIY aesthetic isn't lost with spoken-word interludes sprinkled in between tracks, keeping up the lively energy that continues to capture their audience.    The band's hazy pop-punk sound doesn't change much from their previous releases, but further defines who Dream Nails are, making sure listeners pay attention to what they have to say. This sentiment closes out the album's final track ""Big Dyke Energy,"" which is reminiscent of a sing-along at a protest, as they chant: ""Don't hate us cause you ain't us / We're gonna hex you up.""

One thing that was difficult to dispute, however, was that Krill had songs. If you preferred your rock to skew mathy and humorous, then Krill were the band for you — like the sickly lovechild of  Cake  and  Slint  (and a healthy dose of fellow Bostonians  Pile ), Krill made itchy, silly and ultimately meaningful music.    Following their break-up in 2015, the band told fans why — they'd gone back to school, dedicating their time to fighting for public housing and tenants' rights. They got to work. Their statement also struck at an idea about the alternative music scene that would come to greater light years later — ""People sell engagement in this community as inherently countercultural, oppositional, and antagonistic to power. It's not.""    Given this year's tidal wave of abuse allegations against bands, labels and music industry players, Krill's parting message seems almost prophetic — the belief that these leftist, artistic spaces are fundamentally good or useful has officially crumbled, a collapse that many on the inside saw coming for years.    So how do a band like Krill return to this burning empire? With a new name and a new sense of purpose. Knot are essentially the same band as Krill, though they're now joined by guitarist Joe DeManuelle-Hall. And  Knot , their debut record, sounds quite a bit like a Krill record. However,  Knot  is cleaner, meaner and less interested in catharsis than in tension. The record's highlights — opener ""Fallow,"" the seasick ""Horse Trotting, the Feet Not Touching the Ground,"" restless closer ""Space and Time"" — hum with clear-eyed determination.     The band's name is fitting; each song is built on intricate tangles of guitar and rhythm, a game of constant pressure and release. Jonah Furman's lyrics are still dense and brainy, but they're more concerned with institutions and power this time around. It's too easy to assign some skewed political meaning to just about any art released these days, but Knot feels like the real deal, a soundtrack to fight for something better than what Krill left behind.

Casual Fitness , the sophomore record from Calgary's John Lost and the Cause, is one such record – It's a languid and hazy place, a golden hour that never deepens into dusk.    John Lost and the Cause is the work of Bennett Mitchell, a songwriter who specializes in folky, jazz-laced lounge. Those familiar with 2018's  Chamomile  won't find many surprises on  Casual Fitness.  It's a refining of his sound rather than some grand upheaval, a more detailed, inventive and bright-eyed record than what came before. Produced with Eric Cinnamon,  Casual Fitness  retains the rickety, lived-in warmth of Mitchell's previous record, but it nonetheless feels more polished and spacious — the grooves are smoother, the melodies stronger, the sounds more varied.    For a record destined to soundtrack late august drives and backyard barbeques, it's fitting that one of its best songs is the pillowy ""Summertime City."" The back half of the record is stronger in general than the first, housing most of its glimmering highlights — the buzzing ""Mama,"" the drum-machine and synth groove of ""The Hit"" and closer ""Best, the Boy You Loved"" home to Mitchell's simplest, strongest melody.    Mitchell's conversational warble and floating falsetto lead the way through these snaking arrangements, a narrator in the thralls of romance and heartbreak who nonetheless finds clarity and calm within. The title, the lounging-in-underwear artwork, the relaxed pace —  Casual Fitness  is a laid-back journey of the senses, a sleepy-eyed exploration of falling in love and the ways it changes us.  (Independent)                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More John Lost and the Cause",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/john_lost_and_the_cause_casual_fitness_album_review
2020-08-19,Jack Kelleher,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE",Atramentus Set a New Standard for Canadian Doom Metal on 'Stygian',,"When the cult of  Chthe'ilist  insanely dreamed of the next chapter in the band's mythos, did they ever imagine it would come from another act? Chthe'ilist masterminds Phil Tougas (guitar, vocals), Claude LeDuc (guitar), Antoine Daigneault (bass) are joined by drummer Xavier Berthiaume (Gevurah) and keyboardist Francois Bilodeau in  Atramentus , a newly anointed funeral doom band whose debut album,  Stygian , shows cryptic signs of their previous work while forging its own cursed path ahead.    Atramentus slow down the tempo and turns up the decibels for lofty funeral doom in a dramatic departure from its band members' previous efforts, but there are some noteworthy similarities. Along with a connection to Chthe'ilist's lore, Tougas also brings over his inhuman clicking and croaking gutturals, which lend themselves well to the band's otherworldly sound. Likewise, Berthiaume offers more double kick drumming than is common for doom of this calibre.    That being said, Atramentus have etched their predecessors in runestones and are ready to put them to rest and move on, discovering their true nature in haunting screams and chanting vocals, clean guitar passages as brittle and cold as thin ice, and austere piano parts.    With an arsenal like that, it's safe to say Atramentus run the full gamut of funeral doom, from epic to extreme. Breaking their debut into two main movements, the band use the first part to explore the more bombastic sounds of old school Finnish acts like Thergothon, as ""Stygian I"" opens with massive piano chords tolling like a church bell, then throws open the doors of the underworld to unleash unfathomable amounts of grief and gain. The song maintains a sinister atmosphere, which contrasts well with the album's grim and sorrowful second half. ""Stygian: III"" bears more resemblance to  Mournful Congregation  in its melodicism, soaring lead guitars and near-progressive rock levels of dynamics, but briefly becomes full on forlorn black metal similar to old school  Ulver  in a stern act of iconoclastic genre blending.    In terms of minutes,  Stygian  turns up a bit short by doom standards. Still, there is something to be said about an album that leaves you wanting more, and some landmark funeral doom albums share a similar runtime. What Atramentus achieve in that time sets a new standard for doom from this side of the North. It's a devastating requiem to all things funerary.

Since the release of  Back on Top  in 2015, fans have wanted the band to go back to their roots. They hated how overproduced and formulaic songs sounded. They weren't the rambling stories fans had fallen in love with on the Front Bottom's first two albums.    The New Jersey duo ditch the ultra-clean sound on this album, opting instead for spoken word bridges, experimental instrumentals, and fewer lyrics about getting stoned.    ""everyone blooms,"" a timely reminder to take life at your own place, sounds like a tried and true Front Bottoms song, save for the screamed background vocals. It aptly sounds like two people are singing ""Everyone blooms in their own time / Some far ahead, some far behind"" to one another.    The first of many spoken word bridges appears on ""camouflage,"" a song about being overworked and yearning to go home. Musicians often don't discuss how burnt out they are, but Brian Sella lays it out on this depressing bridge, saying ""I gotta make a commitment / And it's stressing me out / One I'm gonna have to live with / Till I'm under the ground."" Someone let this man take a vacation.    ""the truth"" and ""montgomery forever"" both have head-scratching spoken word passages. One talks about going on a road trip, while on the other, Sella proclaims over an eerie piano tune that he's on ""no drugs."" Neither seem connected to the two songs' main messages.    Musically, ""new song d"" and ""Fairbanks, Alaska"" are gems. The former features rolling snare drums, echoes, and the catchiest chorus on the entire album. The latter is built on power chords reminiscent of  Talon of the Hawk  and a driving kick drum backbone. Crooning ""aah-ooh"" vocals break up the urgency.    As each track is around four minutes long, the album begins to feel drawn on by ""love at first sight."" It's the slowest song and it never seems to end.    On  In Sickness & in Flames , the Front Bottoms decided to let their stream of consciousness dictate the majority of the 12 songs on this album, it's harder to decipher what many of them even mean. It's infuriating, but that's what also why band has such a dedicated fanbase.

2020-08-20,Sydney Brasil,5,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Rey Pila's 'Velox Veritas' Has the Awkward Rigidity of Top 40 Alt-Rock,,"Moderately catchy yet extremely busy, ​ Velox Veritas  sounds like  Imagine Dragons  and  Muse  formed a less obnoxious supergroup. It seems like  Rey Pila  have more in common with the latter, whom they opened for in 2010. Vaguely anarchist and pyromanic lyrics are paired with quirky arena rock vocals on album starters ""Let It Burn"" and ""Dark Paradise,"" though it's never really made clear what's prompting this unrest.    The production is oversaturated, and dry vocals and guitar tones sit on top of extremely wet synths. These elements are mixed with little regard for each other, making it feel like two separate parts happening at the same time for most of the album. This is also exacerbated by the stylistic differences of the effects. It's as if the arrangement of these was secondary to everything else.    Despite this, there are many moments where each element shines on its own. The synths often sound very grandiose, and they're part of what makes ​ Velox Veritas​  so catchy. The  Strokes -y muted guitars at the beginning of ""Josephine"" remind you why  Julian Casablancas  originally picked them up in the first place. If it wasn't all wrapped in a heavy-handed bow, it would be an endearing homage to the post-punk revival.    The indisputable peak of ​ Velox Veritas  ​is its instrumentally pretty and surprisingly ambient closer ""Steps (Pt. 1)"". Though the same repetitive instrumental track is present earlier on the album on ""Steps (Pt. 2)"", moving the lick from the chorus to the verse makes it easier to appreciate its delicacy. It's surprising that an album with the same stiffness of much Top 40 alternative shines when it deviates from the formula that acts as its skeleton. Rey Pila has a lot of promise, they just need to narrow down exactly what they're best at first.

2020-08-20,Jack Kelleher,6,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",Incantation's Old-School Death Metal Is Competent but Inconsistent on 'Sect of Vile Divinities',,"Perhaps no other band have had as profound an effect on the sound of the death metal revival than  Incantation . The Johnstown, Pennsylvania, outfit are one of the defining bands of '90s ""cavernous"" death metal, a secret chamber in the library of old-school death filled with ghostly production and pummelling, atmospheric riffs. Since their inception, the band have cultivated a consistent discography existing somewhere in the abstract nexus of death, doom and black metal, an unpretentious blend of everything extreme that few have successfully pulled off.    With that in mind, a good Incantation record rests on achieving that balance. With the full throttle guitars and blast beats in songs like album opener ""Ritual Impurity (Seven of the Sky is One)"" and ""Chant of Formless Dread,""  Sect of Vile Divinities  will certainly satisfy those with an appetite for crazed old-school death metal. However, most efforts at doom on this album are disappointing, lacking the interesting direction and resolution necessary to stay engaging. Stand-out songs like ""Siege Hive"" and ""Shadow-Blade Masters of Tempest"" are true to form and embody everything Incantation do well, but it's tedious tracks like ""Scribes of Stygian"" that make this album a slog to get through.    Even when this album does wrap up, looking back on it is a bit foggy, because it's severely lacking in hooks. The arcane, serpentine melodies the band are known for are still present in the speed-picking guitar parts, but the soul-crushing set-piece riffs that made iconic albums like  Diabolical Conquest  stand out are not at play here. ""Black Fathom's Fire"" tries to inject a little personality with a sequence of Egyptian-sounding riffs, but the scale sequence is old hat and the execution is stiff, so it comes across sounding like a  Nile  B-side.     Sect of Vile Divinities  is a competent old-school death metal album. There's enough recoil to rattle your skull, but because it doesn't play as well to Incantation's full arsenal of strengths, it's doomed to stay buried in their discography.

2020-08-20,Josiah Hughes,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Killers Shed All Coolness and Take Their Place as Adult-Contemporary Saviours on 'Imploding the Mirage',,"It's been nearly 20 years since a few dozen anthromorphic piles of cocaine in leather jackets ushered in the last truly hyped wave of rock music, bringing with them a legion of leather-clad New Yorkers whose main selling point was their hyper-cool aloofness. But the ravages of age come for everyone, and try as they might,  the Strokes  and their  Meet Me in the Bathroom  cohorts can't maintain that detached coolness now that they're a bunch of sober yuppie parents.    On the other hand, some bands of the era are thriving with middle age. For reasons unknown,  the Killers  were always a little more human than dancer when they were young, offering a brighter side to the glamorous indie rock'n'roll peddled by their peers. In fact, on their sixth studio album,  Imploding the Mirage , the Killers prove that their awkward phase is long behind them.    The band — which at this point in time is mostly singer  Brandon Flowers  and drummer/ My Name Is Earl  lookalike Ronnie Vannucci, with Mark Stoermer and Dave Kuening currently on a break — have always danced with two extremes, offering dejected new wave on  Hot Fuss  before consuming themselves with Americana on every release since. That constant struggle between cool and corny, irony and earnestness, has resulted in some amazing material, but it's also meant constant middling reviews and unspoken status as a singles-only band. With  Imploding the Mirage , however, the corny side of the Killers has won out once and for all, and we're all the better for it.     Imploding the Mirage  crystallizes the Killers's vision and establishes them as untouchable forces in the oft-forgotten subgenre of adult contemporary rock. It helps that vintage sound explorer  Jonathan Rado  is on board to produce alongside alterna-pop mainstay Shawn Everett. Their joint work, along with a guest list that includes  Fleetwood Mac 's  Lindsey Buckingham ,  k.d. lang ,  Weyes Blood ,  the War on Drugs 's Adam Granduciel, Blake Mills and  Lucius  — plus coffee shop-esque art from legendary American painter Thomas Blackshear (who has made paintings for Hallmark Cards and the American Postal Service) — make it clear that this is an album meant for testing out the stereo in a newly leased car or a sound system bought on credit.    Aesthetically aspirational, the album contains the slickness and utopian idealism of late-'80s CD club rock. Half the time, you can close your eyes and picture  Peter Gabriel  bassist  Tony Levin  jamming along with his Chapman Stick, rocking a vest and a dangly earring. Even the title  Imploding the Mirage  is the sort of meaningless po-mo  Bono -ism expertly employed by Gen X-ers who somehow never got into grunge. It's almost like a rock version of vaporwave, triggering some sort of Windows 95 reflex with each harmonica and goofy synth pad. But therein lies it's charm, because the second-wave coffee adult alternative vibes are not meant ironically.     Imploding the Mirage  is an album brimming with hope, almost comically so in the face of so much disaster. Still, where Flowers's lyrics have often overpowered with their schmaltz, he completely owns them here as he sings about, as always, America, (the Mormon version of) God, death, and more America. Sans cynicism there is still something subversive when, for example, he sings ""We're all going to die"" before a canned  True Stories -esque synth kicks in on the album's penultimate track, ""When the Dreams Run Dry.""    Decades into their career, it still feels like a left turn when the Killers write a song that doesn't feel like a soundtrack to a montage of a road trip through heartland America. And the classic Killers cuts here are among their best — both ""My Own Soul's Warning"" and ""Caution"" are absolute belters, brimming with big dumb leads, impatiently peppy tempos and timeless Flowers vocals. But there's nary a skip across all of the album's 10 tracks. In fact, it's a release that feels simultaneously expansive and small, offering tasteful  Taylor Swift -esque pop (""Blowback""), noughties dance pop (""Dying Breed,"" which risks being  LCD Soundsystem -lite before hitting another beast of a chorus), mid-period  Bowie  synthpop (""Lightning Fields,"" ""Fire in Bone"") and, in a deft move, a closing title track that sounds less like a sprawling rock ballad and more like the end credits of a Nickelodeon kids show.    The Killers have well over a dozen songs that have soundtracked myriad life experiences for aging millennials, so it's easy to understand why they've always been considered a greatest hits band. Their albums are also filled with moments of goofy goodness (""Be Still,"" ""This River Is Wild""), but the hits were simply too great to reconcile with the rest of the catalogue. By shedding any cool pretence and steering directly into the skid of adult alternative cheese, the Killers have followed a lifetime of perfect songs and made their first truly great album.

That influence can be heard on this album, as Nyssa forges an original sound, stating; ""I aim to shed light on new pathways. Non-men lack the power to wander freely.""    Gender subversion has always been a major component of glam music, although different artists utilize it differently. Nyssa is going beyond subversion. Rather than simply turning gender upside down, Nyssa blasts it to smithereens. Interestingly enough, the music on  Girls Like Me  also bridges the gulf between glam and rock'n'roll, and some very faint folk/country influences can be heard as well. The use of electronic sounds means that glam artists are no longer dependent on their physical existence in space, allowing for new possibilities. Nyssa is not only enjoying this freedom, but also reexamining the space.    Everything is being called into question here: gender roles and gender subversion, musical traditions and the rejection of musical traditions. In ""The Swans"" the lyrics are, at times more spoken than sung, with very dance-able electronic music in the background: ""People will talk and talk they like to talk about five year plans and money down… I'm alive!""    There are also moments where the melody has the singable quality of a folk song. ""Hey Jackie"" starts out slow before kicking into a stronger beat. One can't help but imagine how the song might sound in a solo acoustic version.    In ""anybodys"", which is slow and ominous, Nyssa's voice takes on an operatic quality. The song has both a submissive and a vengeful feeling to it, with the lyrics ""I see you got out of the big house in one piece / You got no clue, do you, just how happy that makes me.""    In listening to  Girls Like Me , there is the sense of not knowing what Nyssa will do next. This is an exciting debut album with the promise of even more light shed along this new pathway.

For  No Joy , their dense guitars and echoing vocals make for an immersive experience, but heavy distortion doesn't exactly help if you want to get people moving. Regardless, on  Motherhood , Jasamine White-Gluz tries anyway, kicking the record off with ""Birthmark,"" a poppier, more propulsive song that also happens to be one of the record's best tracks. It's no fluke.  Motherhood  is an eclectic record that shows White-Gluz at her most exploratory, twisting No Joy's sound into new, compelling shapes.    This exploratory approach is a large part of what makes this record interesting. A track like ""Ageless"" sounds more like  the Knife  than  Slowdive , while the back half of ""Four"" features probably some of the most aggressive guitar work in No Joy's entire catalogue. After a string of EPs showing a more experimental bent, the work on  Motherhood  shows how malleable the basic elements of shoegaze really are.     With shades of post-rock, '90s techno, dance pop and more, it's impressive how organic a lot of No Joy's genre-bending feels.  Motherhood 's expansive sound palette is easily one of its biggest strengths, like the electronics of ""Happy Bleeding"" or the  Beach House -esque atmosphere of ""Primal Curse."" No Joy have learned a lot in the five years since their last full-length, 2015's  More Faithful  and  Motherhood  is the perfect encapsulation of that.

Championed by the crystalline, four-octave range of mezzo-soprano vocalist Brittney Slayes, and stellar production from legendary Danish producer Jacob Hansen ( Volbeat ,  U.D.O. , Amaranthe), the record delivers several high-octane tracks tempered by heartfelt ballads and mid-tempo stompers.    A concept album and sequel to 2017's  Apex , Abyss is like that dusty old cassette that slipped out of your old Gamma World game box. Lyrically, it emits a retro metal vibe akin to the classic fantasy releases from the likes of Yngwie Malmsteen, but with a less pretentious approach.    Kicking off with the ethereal ""Waking Dream"" and combustible ""Abyss,""  Abyss  is a true masterclass in technical prowess thanks to Grant Truesdell and Andrew Kingsley's blistering guitar work, with Scott Buchanan's drumming in the pocket throughout. Other standout tracks are pop-dappled ""Legacy,"" anthemic ""Return to Me,"" the speedy, appropriately-titled ""Faster Than Light,"" and ""Carry the Flame,"" which features a vocal duet between Slayes and Kingsley.    With releases like  Abyss  and  Apex , Unleash the Archers continue to lead a new wave of Canadian heavy metal alongside the likes of genre-bending stalwarts like  Skull Fist ,  Kobra and the Lotus ,  Striker ,  Diemonds  and  Cauldron . These acts not only tip their caps to the past but continue to drive the genre to new heights.  (Napalm)                           METAL AND HARDCORE   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Unleash the Archers",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/unleash_the_archers_abyss_album_review
2020-08-21,Angela Morrison,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC,SOUL & FUNK","Turning Jewels into Water Decentre Shallow Understandings of ""World"" Music with 'Our Reflection Adorned by Newly Formed Stars'",,"Turning Jewels into Water , the collaborative project between electronic musicians Val Jeanty and Ravish Momin, are a brilliant demonstration of music built upon deeply felt nonverbal communication that defies any simple genre categorizations. Their newest full-length album,  Our Reflection Adorned by Newly Formed Stars , is a testament to the strength of the project that began in 2017, when the two artists participated in an improvisatory jam session together and discovered rich collaborative potential in their combined musical talents. The album features additional contributions from Iranian musician Kamyar Arsani and South African instrumentalist Mpho Molikeng, further emphasizing the project's commitment to collective creation and a sense of globality.    Turning Jewels into Water actively decentre shallow, Westernized understandings of ""world"" music, and draw upon Jeanty and Momin's personal experiences and intimate cultural knowledge to build layered electronic dreamscapes. Haitian-born Jeanty evokes the deep spiritual traditions of Vodou, while Momin reimagines Indian folk music and jazz, and magic emerges as the music swirls, skips, undulates and crashes like ocean waves. As the album's press release states, the hypnotic, spaced-out, bass-heavy sound on tracks such as ""Flower in Flames"" is inspired by South African gqom musicians such as  DJ Lag  and the looping darkness of New York illbient artists such as We™.    The album maintains a balance between darkness and light, frantic movement and meditative stillness, rejecting such binaristic divisions in favour of complexity, transformation and non-linear thinking. Tracks such as ""Swirl in the Waters"" and ""Whispers Under Dal Lake"" loop and rework whispered words and vocalizations, drawing out the emotive and musical qualities of human voices, while ""Crushed Petals and Stones Fall on My Drum"" lovingly ties the act of making music to respect for and connection with nature and the environment.  Our Reflection  ends with two remixes, one by Laughing Ears for ""Crushed Petals,"" and one by EMB for ""Flower in Flames."" The songs are slowed down, stretched out and subtly reimagined, encapsulating Turning Jewels into Water's overall commitment to constant growth and new perspectives.     Our Reflection Adorned by Newly Formed Stars , much like 2019's  Maps of Absences , emphasizes the importance of thinking globally, seeing beyond narrow-minded nationalisms toward cross-cultural connections built upon genuine respect and solidarity rather than shallow fetishization and simplification. This is music tapped into the potential to transform the present by bridging past traditions to unknown futures.

Both musicians grew up in Sault Ste. Marie, which informs their decision to tell the story of small town characters on summersets' debut EP,  Small Town Saturday , which explores the different stages of falling in love.    The six-track EP perfectly blends of classic folk revivalism and 21st century experimentalism, which will appeal to fans of everything from  Simon & Garfunkel ,  CSNY  and  Wilco  to  Blitzen Trapper , Wilderado and JR JR. ""Anywhere You Go"" is immediately enchanting, with handclaps rumbling in the background and duetting vocals alternating between harmony and unison. ""Shots in the Dark"" and ""More Less"" both present a more tense, tumultuous aspect of love but also have the most rousing and upbeat melodies.    The effective use of such simple sounds and themes makes for a stunning display — the same sentiment that comes from just sitting outside in the evening with a few friends, looking at a beautiful sunset. This might be nice music to fall in love to, in any case, it is great music to fall in love with.

2020-08-24,Spencer Nafekh-Blanchette,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Sneaks Flexes Talent and Versatility on 'Happy Birthday',,"If there is anything  Sneaks  has revealed about herself thus far, it is that she is a master at giving it her all while also not giving a fuck. This is characteristic of Eva Moolchan's minimalist take on post-punk, but it is not always black and white — on her energizing sophomore LP,  It's a Myth , the scale tipped more towards the giving-it-her-all side. On the other hand, Moolchan's disorienting 2019 release,  Highway Hypnosis , clearly favoured not giving a fuck. The latest Sneaks project,  Happy Birthday , reinforces Moolchan as a talented but volatile artist with highs and lows.    ""Faith,"" the album's second track, showcases Sneaks at her best, with a groovy bassline at its foundation and a swing-infused drum machine reminiscent of  LCD Soundsystem . On ""Sanity,"" things move downtempo with ice-cold, trap inspired drums and a slow, ominous buildup. ""Scorpio on Your Side"" is yet another song that is memorable while simultaneously being impressively unique. Lush,  Playboi Carti -type synths are certain to entrance listeners, and Moolchan's flow sounds equally sedated and commanding, as though she is both the hypnotist and the hypnotized.    But while Happy Birthday's memorable tracks veer in exciting and peculiar directions, in the album's low points it seems that Sneaks is going nowhere at all. The opening track, ""Do You Want to Go Out Tonight,"" has some interesting production, but the oft-repeated title lyric becomes boring very quickly. At other low points, such as ""Mars in Virgo"" and ""Slightly Sophisticated,"" Sneaks murmurs lyrics that sound like a freestyle, offbeat and in a nearly monotone voice, emanating a vibe that feels bleak and uninspired.    Eva Moolchan reaches new heights in her career on  Happy Birthday , but not without encountering a few bumps in the road. Even at its questionable points, though, there is something beautifully refreshing about a new Sneaks album — Moolchan is having fun, and she doesn't care what you think about it.

2020-08-13,Sarah Chodos,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",AMAARA Brings Visual Sensibilites to Her Meditative Pop on 'Heartspeak',,"Sometimes a musician is actually a multi-disciplinarian who creates music as just one component of their work. Sometimes music is actually multimedia with sound as only one dimension. This is the case for  AMAARA , a.k.a. Kaelen Ohm, and her new album,  Heartspeak .    Ohm spent part of her childhood in Fernie, BC, surrounded by nature, and has also lived in Calgary and Toronto. Currently, she resides in Los Angeles, where she pursues an acting career, and will have a regular role in the upcoming Netflix series  Hit and Run . She is also a filmmaker, and has shot and acted in her own music videos.    Ohm's singing voice is deeper and more serious than the dreamy images might suggest. Her acting and dancing gives her musical performance an inherent cinematic quality, and  Heartspeak  has an accompanying video element.    The music is surreal and nuanced. It could be used to meditate to, but would likely draw attention to itself and away from the meditation because of its interesting complexity.    The beginning of the video for ""Gone"" features Ohm in a pickup truck moving through the desert, which goes quite well with the futuristic, motion-invoking sound of the music. There are beautiful moving-through-desert shots throughout, and Ohm is seen playing guitar and dancing. The end features a strong electronic drumbeat and a beautiful desert horizon with a sunset.    The video for ""Awake"" shows her riding a train and dancing through a city at sunrise, or in a fog — appropriate for a slow-moving song where the glimmer of sun is complemented by a glimmer of post-punk influence. The vocals for ""Desert Storm"" almost sound like a chant, and ""Lover"" has whispers of an old English ballad, all with electronic sound complimenting that which is raw and human.

2020-08-13,Luke Pearson,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC",BT Returns to Trance on 'The Lost Art of Longing' and Proves Why He's One of the Best,,"Few trance artists have crossed over into mainstream professional respectability as thoroughly as  BT  (Brian Transeau). Movie and videogame soundtracks, audio plugins (his patented ""stutter edit"" technique can be heard in  Star Wars , apparently), soundscapes for Tomorrowland at Shanghai Disney — it's a varied and impressive résumé.    Once upon a time he released seminal trance albums as well — every trance head back in the day had a copy of 1997's  ESCM , for instance (which, along with  Paul Oakenfold 's  Tranceport  and  Paul Van Dyk 's  Seven Ways , formed something of a turn-of-the-century triad of trance). His follow-up, 2000's  Movement in Still Life , was a masterclass in crossover appeal, sitting next to  Moby  and  Fatboy Slim  in the newly created 'electronica' collections of people who'd never even heard of trance. Latter-day albums followed, but other projects beckoned, and now his latest, 2020's  The Lost Art of Longing , has been billed as the American artist's long-awaited return to trance proper after more than a decade.    A lot has happened during that time — the old euphoric trance vibes he once trafficked in having transitioned into the more subdued progressive trance styles of today for one, and, skilled as he is, BT dabbles in progressive here and there on  The Lost Art of Longing  with solid results. This kind of effortless versatility has been a hallmark of his style for a while now, and in that regard, his latest is a real tour de force, with Transeau seemingly putting every sound design technique he's learned over the years to use.    While dazzling from a technical standpoint, it does give the album an overworked feel (another BT hallmark), with the production sounding flat and attenuated at times to make room for the epic scale on display — a sound where you're just as likely to hear orchestral strings at any second as you are rock drums, dubstep wobbles or tropical soundscapes.    It's all handled so nimbly and exuberantly that it's hard to find too much fault however, and, for every inessential diversion, there's another that's wholly worthwhile (the cool and unexpected slap-bass interlude of ""I Will Be Yours"" for instance). He still has a tendency to overuse his vocalists, repeating the same trite phrases over and over, and his epic runtimes don't always justify their lengths, but no one shoots for the stars quite like BT, and long-time fans have likely come to terms with his signature brand of overblown pretentiousness long ago. There is excess here, but also expertise.

2020-08-14,Sam Boer,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC",Kathleen Edwards Packs Her Alt-Country Songs with Emotional Power on 'Total Freedom',,"Kathleen Edwards 's  Total Freedom , which signals a return to music after a nearly six-year hiatus, is a reminder that vulnerability has always been her greatest strength. Since this Ottawa-based singer-songwriter's powerful debut,  Failer  in 2003, Edwards has become renowned for spinning small, colloquial truths into concise, touching statements, often clad in lush full-band arrangements; her most recent record proves that this formula — though tried, and perhaps a tad tired — remains true.    Take, for instance, her meditation on homegrown, on-your-own peace,  ""Birds on  Feeder,""  in which she beckons, ""Come on feelings, won't you go away?"" Here, Edwards's unshowy voice captures this intimate feeling with acoustic guitar, autoharp, dripping piano keys, and lush sonic atmosphere tying it together as an evident, emotive scene. Or consider ""Ashes to Ashes,"" where Edwards' announces, ""The world is on fire, God is not in the clouds,"" as the guitar plucks and the floor tom drums.    This album so often showcases Edwards making statements packed with immediate feeling over somewhat predictable, inoffensive arrangements, resting on her laurels while exploring this new phase in her life and career: returning to the industry after famously  packing it in , taking  time and space for the good of her mental health , and starting the successful Quitters café. This is most evident on the album highlight, ""Options Open,"" in which Edwards proclaims, with refreshing clarity and openness, ""For 39 years I've been keeping my options open.""    What is perhaps most surprising is the fact that Edwards is not returning from this hiatus with a new musical statement, per se, but rather with a resurrection of her musical tendencies expressed since her early records. Sonically,  Total Freedom  could be a reissue of any early 2000s alt-country album — the drums are clean and do the right fills, the electric guitars are just edgy enough to be radio-friendly, the harmonies come in at precisely the logical moments.    Despite the underwhelming musicality of  Total Freedom , many of these songs still pack some undeniable emotional force, especially the more joyful tracks like ""Who Rescued Who"" — a charming ode from Edwards to her dog. In her songcraft, Edwards remains dependable and enjoyable.

2020-08-17,Alex Hudson,6,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Bright Eyes' Apocalyptic Warnings Don't Have Much Bite on 'Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was'",,"Bright Eyes ' press materials describe the group as ""a project whose friendship is at the core"" — except that's not the relationship listeners have with the veteran Omaha band. Throughout the group's early-'00s heyday, they were a glorified solo vehicle for songwriter  Conor Oberst : the kind of project where he could gather all of his friends for an indie folk opus (2002's   Lifted ) or tear everything down for an insular synth-pop record (2005's  Digital Ash in a Digital Urn ).    But, now that Oberst has his own full-blown solo project, the only thing to distinguish a Bright Eyes album is the contribution of multi-instrumentalists Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott.  Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was  is the group's first album since 2011, and takes a more collaborative, lavish approach than  the project's best work .    The record begins in typical Bright Eyes fashion: with an adorably pretentious sketch, ""Pageturner's Rag,"" a collage of cryptic conversation snippets, jazzy piano/horn tootling and sonic weirdness. But after that, we're into a string of elegant, ornate indie rock songs. The new wave-tinged ""Mariana Trench"" has one of the catchiest pop choruses you'll ever hear in a Bright Eyes song, but its poetic images of crumbling highways and wiretaps are a little too nebulous to really capture the horrors of the current moment. Back in the Bush era, Bright Eyes ruthlessly eviscerated America with ""When the President Talks to God""; here, the best he can manage is, ""Look out on the ever-widening money trail and where it goes."" Okay, and?    Perhaps it's unfair to compare to the 40-year-old Oberst's lyrics to ones he wrote in his 20s, but even compared to his recent albums — 2017's  Salutations  or last year's  Better Oblivion Community Center  collaboration with  Phoebe Bridgers  — his songs here don't cut quite as deep.  Down in the Weeds  is full of artful, vaguely apocalyptic poetry, but grandly orchestral tracks like ""Dance and Sing"" and ""One and Done"" are easier to admire than deeply relate to. Oberst has matured into a confident, unmistakably unique singer, so the real pleasures here come when he desperately strains for the high notes in the chorus of ""Calais to Dover"" or quavers when crooning about chopping celery on ""Hot Car in the Sun.""    Even with its ominous warnings about a civilization on the brink of downfall,  Down in the Weeds  mostly sounds like a fun reunion between old friends. It's a logical continuation of 2007's slick  Cassadaga  (less so 2011's rock-inclined  The People's Key ) — but given the renaissance Oberst has enjoyed with his side-projects in recent years, it doesn't quite live up to Bright Eyes' lofty name.

2020-08-17,Rachel Evangeline Chiong,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK",Casey MQ Celebrates and Interrogates the Glamour of '90s Boy Band Pop on 'babycasey',,"Casey MQ' s solo debut record,  babycasey , drops familiar '90s tropes like a time machine, but with a message as personal and reflective as a bedroom mirror.    The album reflects on Casey MQ's childhood, an era defined by a fascination for boy band culture. But when adolescent innocence faded away to make room for adulthood, it unmasked the culture's aggressive heterenormative standards that had sweltered underneath the glamour. Casey MQ expresses this contrast sonically. His vocals are pitched higher whenever he sings childhood sentiments in songs like ""What About Us"" and ""The First Song I Ever Wrote,"" which differentiates these thoughts from his falsetto lines throughout the album.    Considering its sound, the record is pop decadence and then some. Much like the cover art of the album, Casey MQ's raw and bare lyrics are liberally adorned and accessorized with sparkling, gaudy pop tropes. But this album soars above and beyond by embodying pop and playing to its strengths. This is markedly different from ""experimental pop,"" where one explores the fringes of the genre by poking at the boundaries with unfamiliar instruments or conventions. Instead, Casey MQ leans into the pop genre — he dives in, splashing listeners with falsetto harmonies, muffled club beats and even the trademark acoustic guitar in ""Half Awake."" His masterful composition on the synthesizer superglues the samples and lyrics together seamlessly. ""What About Us,"" with its arpeggiated synth, is emotionally cathartic, and ""Monsters Without Names"" includes deep bass waves that rumble beneath the surface of the melody, ominous yet picturesque.    Casey MQ's  babycasey  manifests the power of pop. The music's inescapable dazzle tugs against the heartstrings of listeners, then pulls them head first into the turbulent and emotional world of Casey MQ's unapologetic artistry.

What ensues on  SUGAREGG , her third album, is zippy yet vexed grunge where Bognanno illustrates her disorientation with an ever-changing life and breaking free of stifling traditions.    A sense of free-spiritedness is present on the album, almost nostalgic and childlike, a change of tone from Bully's denser 2017 sophomore record,  Losing . Despite this, the album does not shy away from heavier explorations. Bognanno cites the treatment of her bipolar II disorder for having altered her perception of herself and her ability to craft music, with the sluggish desensitization to pain on ""Prism"" and the slow burn of ""Come Down"" as reflections of this state of mind.    Bognanno's disorientation and ennui never lacks soul or punchiness, however. The single, ""Where to Start,"" was inspired by  Chumbawamba 's 1997 classic song ""Tubthumping"", evident in her chanting vocals, which, across the record and Bully's discography, are at times one-note with their mumbled raspiness. But the sounds of the record are an exhilarating rush nonetheless — a refreshing combo of raw and clean.    Amidst the grungy throwback sounds, Bognanno craves to break the mold, especially as a woman, with the tracks ""Every Tradition"" and ""Not Ashamed"" showing her disinterest in conforming to the expectations of life laid out in front of her by others. Simply put, Bully knows how to make music for feeling young and utterly confused, sometimes hopeless, and ultimately, completely alive.

Understandably, artists and genuine music fans lost what was left of their pandemic-fried minds. Who was this billionaire vampire to say so flatly what he and his service had been insinuating for years?    It's a scary thought, that one of humanity's only inherent, immovable gifts could be reduced to a numbers game, a commodity to be pumped out at rapid speed and sold, streamed and TikTok'ed into meaninglessness. But if there's one band capable of flourishing in Ek's dystopian hellscape, it's  Guided By Voices .    That probably sounds like an insult, but it's not. GBV are somehow both the embodiment and antithesis of Ek's vision – art made at a breakneck pace, but for no reason beyond expression and a love of melody and sound, unfit for padding chill vibe playlists or topping charts.  Mirrored Aztec , the band's fifth(!) album since 2019, is further proof that Pollard and co. are beyond anyone's artistic standard but their own.    From the energetic riff that opens ""I Think I Had It. I Think I Have It,"" the album is a nonstop ride of Pollard's classic pop melodies and simply innovative compositions. There are some small detours – ""Math Rock"" is exactly what the title implies, until a children's choir wanders in and takes it somewhere else – and the immense corrosion of GBV classics like  Bee Thousand  or  Alien Lanes  has been polished away.  Mirrored Aztec  is also more tight and clean than February's  Surrender Your Poppy Field  – that Pollard still has this many hooks in him is mystifying.    Still, there's an inevitable case of diminishing returns – GBV's latter-day records are so reliable and frequent that they're easy to take for granted. It's best to take them on their own terms and momentarily ignore the dozens of records that precede them, lest you feel overwhelmed – there's always something worthwhile waiting in the mix. It's no small comfort that Pollard is still out there in the world, creating music because he feels it, because it means something, even if that meaning is inscrutable to us. People like Daniel Ek may well praise Pollard for the pace of his output, but they will never understand him.

Campfire Chords  is here, and although it's a new release from the band, it's not an entirely new album. Arkells took a pause from working on their upcoming studio album and went back to their roots, reinterpreting past material and rediscovering the singer-songwriter spirit that has long informed their trademark singalongs.    For what it is — an entire acoustic album with a constant mellow sound that feels a bit like one run-on song at times —  Campfire Chords  is very good, but it is also very long.    Arkells clearly demonstrate their creativity in rewriting some of their greatest hits with emphasis on their catchy hooks. ""Quitting You"" — an intimate song about finding comfort in the people closest to you —was the first single dropped to promote  Campfire Chords , and it is definitely an album standout. Arkells have a way of making you feel connected to all the good in the world and ""Quitting You"" does exactly like that. ""Whistleblower"" is another instant winner. The repurposed tune — originally off the band's 2011 album  Michigan Left  — has a western vibe to it that brings a sense of intensity to the song. Think Old West standoff, featuring tumbleweeds and frontman Max Kerman wearing cowboy boots.    Not every song works as well acoustically. ""Years in the Making"" and ""Relentless"" work better in their original forms as pump-up, blast-in-your-car-with-the-window-rolled-down jams.    At over an hour in length,  Campfire Chords  could have benefited from a shorter runtime; not every song included on the LP needed a reimagining. Quality over quaintly, after all. Had the album been cut to, say, 10 songs, it could've been perfect.    That said, it's still a solid release from Arkells that will be sung around many campfires for years to come, with many choices to pick from if you opt to learn a song (from one of their  music classes , perhaps). The album reminds us of the importance of taking a step back from the chaos of our everyday lives and enjoy the things that make life so amazing. The boys are as talented as ever and the anticipation for a new studio release is as intense as can be.    There's no quitting you, Arkells.

Yet the resultant 3-hour-long opus – meant to be absorbed in one sitting – is anything but straightforward. With  The Consuming Flame: Open Exercises in Group Form , Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt have produced their most ambitious and eclectic piece of work yet.    Sampling a short list of the pair's collaborators might prepare folks for the wide-ranging and brilliant nature of this magnum opus. Daniel and Schmidt started by enlisting long-time pals such as J Lesser and Wobbly. Widening the circle a bit, they enlisted the skills of electronic contemporaries such as  Max Tundra ,  Mouse on Mars ,  Rabit  and DeForrest Brown, Jr. Throwing caution to the wind, they eschewed genre and asked  Yo La Tengo ,  David Grubbs  and John Elliott (of  Emeralds ) to join in.    Diving deep underground, the pair wrangled content from brain melting noise makers (Id M Theft Able), ""new music"" composers ( Sarah Hennies ), and even contemporary authors (Douglas Rushkoff). Like master puppeteers. Daniel and Schmidt sliced and diced the sounds they received, added more field recordings, samples and sounds, and worked the gelatinous mass of audio into  The Consuming Flame .    Listening to the entire recording from end to end in a single sitting is a daunting task, especially in this age of shrinking attention spans and the digital pachinko offered by the ever-present smartphone. But there are so many moments of clarity offered by  The Consuming Flame  that it's probably best for the listener to put their music player on repeat mode and allow it to be their life's soundtrack.    At turns groovy (the dank psych rock of ""Adam's Apple""), cerebral (the faulty heartbeat and rubbery electronics of ""Cold Open""), and downright confounding (the digital argumentation, whimsical honking and yodelling of ""I'm Fine I'm Fine""),  The Consuming Flame  is Matmos at their finest. Daniel and Schmidt have taken the simplest of concepts and manipulated it into a gorgeous and grotesque beast of an album.

2020-08-18,Adam Wallis,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","The Lemon Twigs Aren't Breaking Ground on 'Songs for the General Public,' but Their Classic Rock Remains Exciting",,"It's been two years since the release of their 2018 rock opera,  Go to School , but now — after a four-month delay brought upon by a pandemic —  the Lemon Twigs ' third LP,  Songs for the General Public , is here. Because they've recycled the prime musical components of what made their first two records so splendid, this feels more like a compilation of greatest hits, rather than a cohesive album with a beginning, middle and end.    Having said that, by no means is it a dumbed-down collection from the Long Island-based rock duo. You get not only the signature theatrical power pop elements that make up their unique sound, but also a refreshing blitz of ideas that effectively showcase the musical dynamics brothers Michael and Brian D'Addario are capable of.    So was it worth the wait? Well, there are 12 brand new offerings on this album and fortunately, it's jam-packed with highlights, including: opening track ""Hell on Wheels,"" ""Fight,"" the highly thespian ""Moon,"" infectious lead single ""The One,"" and a bitter and comedic love song entitled ""Hog."" For the most part, these tracks are driven by twangy guitar melodies, Kubrick-esque synth hooks and a sometimes-overwhelming barrage of interlocked vocal harmonies. The drums are tight and the bass tracks are consistently groovy.    While none of the songs are bad, per se, there are a few — most notably, the fourth and latest single ""No One Holds You (Closer Than the One You Haven't Met),"" plus ""Only a Fool"" — which bear no clear direction, due to their chaotic and disorderly structures.    If you want enjoy it this album to its fullest potential, your utmost attention is required. At times, it offers the listener a bit too much and feels bloated. One moment you can hear inklings of  Mick Jagger  and a howling  Iggy Pop  accompanied by  Elton John 's backing band; the next, you might think you're listening to  the Stranglers  or a young  Alice Cooper 's take on  Bat Out of Hell .    If you can properly digest the convoluted nature of  Songs for the General Public , then you'll be glad you gave it a shot. While not groundbreaking, it's a revitalizing rock record that is bound to rekindle the excitement of taking a chance on a (relatively) new band.

The artists on this tape reside in Tiohtiá:ke, also known as Montreal, and acknowledge their privilege as settlers. This 20-song compilation is filled with electronic sounds that attempt to reconceive the way in which we engage with our history and how we will continue to honour and address it. The proceeds from  Re:Conceive  are being split evenly between the  Native Women's Shelter of Montreal  and the  Just Solutions Clinic .    Tati au Miel's ""150 Reasons"" is an emotional experimental track that likely nods to the recent Canada 150 celebration, critiquing each year post-confederation. The abrasive tone heard on this song permeates throughout the album, where the theme of violence against Indigenous people surrounds protests, murders and land theft. Ouri's ""Free State of Chaos"" is a house song that feels transcendental and transiently chaotic, peacefully cultivating a corrosive melody that furthers the album's messages; the song oscillates between a melody resembling birds chirping and alarming noises. Igitego MusoNi's ""Skawanoti"" pays tribute to the river colonially called Rivière-des-Prairies, which was taken by the French settlers. Something as simple as the track titles can be powerful, by allowing an introduction for many who are uninformed to learn.    Through themes of freedom, safety, violence and solidarity, this compilation aurally attempts to forge a conversation aiming to mitigate the rise of right-wing politics in Quebec. The songs featured on this compilation inherently imprint a vision of unity, and the sonic dissonance strengthens the theme of individualism over assimilation. The variety heard among the community shows so many different tones encouraging the diversity amongst people living in Tiohtiá:ke; the discordance creates a cohesive compilation which serves its purpose harmonically.

But on their latest LP,  Pyramid , the octet come off more ""progressive rock"" than ""progressive.""    Over four tracks and 40 minutes, Jaga Jazzist craft a style of angular, synthetic, silky jazz that would satisfy fans of Return to Forever, the Weather Report or even Emerson, Lake & Palmer.    But that's not to say that their seventh LP (and first in five years) isn't adventurous or alluring, because it certainly delivers on both fronts. Released on  Flying Lotus -curated label Brainfeeder, tracks like the funky ""The Shrine"" and the electronic closer ""Apex"" take cues from post-rock, Afrobeat and modern jazz, which finds the group locking into a dense groove to close out the album.    Wholly produced by the band and recorded in just two weeks by core members, rather than their traditional weeks-long sessions,  Pyramid  works best when things feel spontaneous and energy-fuelled. But the 14-minute opener ""Tomita"" and the eight-minute follow-up ""Spiral Era"" come off a but too heady and intricate for their own good, as if the musicians are too concerned with staying out of each other's way than actually playing off one another.    The result is that  Pyramid  is an imperfect and uneven album that satisfies two different audiences, as the front half is packed with wandering jam band noodling while the second half tightens into a slightly more focused and rhythmic set. It's just a shame that Jaga Jazzist wasn't able to give the listener a more cohesive and unified version of what they were trying to achieve with  Pyramid .

2020-08-07,Alex Hudson,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Washed Out Is Back in His Reverb-Heavy Niche on 'Purple Noon',,"After branching out on 2017's beat-driven  Mister Mellow , with its hip-hop influences and largely instrumental soundscapes,  Washed Out  has returned to his comfort zone with  Purple Noon . He's not only back with his previous label, Sub Pop, but he's back to crafting reverb-blurred hypnagogic pop full of summery, sunburnt beauty.    Much like he's done for the past decade, songwriter Ernest Greene flirts with the chillwave sounds he's known for without too blatantly repeating himself. The vocals are a little clearer and more prominent than they were on 2009's zeitgeist-capturing  Life of Leisure  EP, and the the synths are bright and sparkling rather than gritty and lo-fi. But the haze remains: ""Too Late"" and ""Reckless Desires"" are blissful daydreams full of elongated syllables and rippling, aquatic rhythms.  Purple Noon  was apparently inspired by the Mediterranean coastline, which is fitting given the way classic-era chillwave was closely associated with the beach.    There are some modest surprises scattered throughout the 10-song tracklist. ""Time to Walk Away"" takes inspiration from Latin rhythms and electro-reggae, while ""Game of Chance"" is an acoustic ballad with a Spanish guitar solo. But even in the case of these outliers, the ever-present fog of reverb means that they sound unmistakably like Washed Out.    Given that the chillwave craze only lasted a year or two, this is another solid outing from an artist who has turned a flash-in-the-pan trend into a deep discography.

The alt-rap project combines incredible vinyl samples, continuous narrative, and unrivalled breakbeats with Brigham's biting vocals. Marlowe came together with the sole purpose of uniting Brigham's social commentary surrounding police brutality and poverty with the eclectic crackle of L'Orange's beats, producing an indie-rap unit comparable to a grittier version of  the Avalanches  with a substantial helping of  Madvillain .    Their self-titled debut was an astonishing mix of vinyl chops and steely raps, their collaborative spark burning bright. Marlowe 2 proves an impressive continuation of Brigham's quickfire vocals and L'Orange's stepped-up breakbeat. ""Future Power Sources"" deals with blown out brass and grainy trumpet riding throughout the track with scratching and strangled guitar peeking through. Taking a step back, lo-fi vinyl vocal cuts across ""Can't Have Me Nothing,"" with Brigham spitting effortless lyrics (""How could you put up with my ways and never protest, I guess sometimes it really pays to be chosen"") and underrated organ pipes making up the base of the beat.    The nostalgia  Marlowe 2  throws out also adds to its appeal, with hints of  Madvillainy  and  Mos Def 's  Black on Both Sides  comparable with their own off-kilter and unique approaches to hip-hop. While certainly not the first to approach the genre from such an angle,  Marlowe 2  is another foothold for the duo.

2020-08-07,Manus Hopkins,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",Black Crown Initiate's 'Violent Portraits of Doomed Escape' Is an Extreme Metal Triumph,,"The biggest names in metal have been pretty quiet this year, at least where new studio material is concerned. There have been albums released by big bands of course, but not by anybody arena-fillingly huge in the genre. This isn't necessarily a bad thing — in fact, the upside to it is that it allows more attention to be given to mid-league metal stalwarts like Pennsylvania's  Black Crown Initiate .     Constantly touring since 2014, Black Crown Initiate had built up an impressive resume for a group only two albums in. The wait between their latest, 2016's  Selves We Cannot Forgive , and  Violent Portraits of Doomed Escape  was long, but the band wasn't idle during this time. And besides, four years isn't too long a wait when it's for an album like this one.      Violent Portraits of Doomed Escape  is exactly the album that should propel Black Crown Initiate forward and cement them as a mainstay force in 21st century metal. Like their previous two albums, it blends several styles, from death metal to progressive metal, but the songs on this record sound more fleshed out, like the band took all the time they needed to get everything exactly the way they wanted.      One of the best things about this record is that it doesn't wear out its welcome. Extreme metal albums can be overlong, and unfairly doom their last few tracks to not receive the same enthusiasm as the top halves.  Violent Portraits of Doomed Escape  is comprised of just nine tracks, and while they can be long songs, there's enough musical diversity on the album to keep it from dragging.     This record is another triumph for metal in 2020. It will be an exciting day when we get to see Black Crown Initiate perform their new material live, but at least we have the album to listen to until then.

2020-08-07,Owen Morawitz,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE",Terminal Nation Remind Us That Humanity Is Screwed with 'Holocene Extinction',,"On the provocatively titled  Holocene Extinction , Arkansas bruisers  Terminal Nation  make two things abundantly clear: they're not here to mince words, and things are pretty much fucked. Every day individuals are forced to face down the ills of political corruption, the devastating effects of anthropogenic climate change, corporate greed, civil unrest, the ongoing threat of a deadly global pandemic, and ongoing cultural stagnation. And in taking a good, hard look at the miserable state of the world around us, at our never-ending cycles of increasingly depressing current events — one might ask: where's the lie?    With this politically and ideologically charged question in mind, the debut full-length from the Little Rock quintet serves as both a warning to humanity and an outright declaration of war. Opener ""Cognitive Dissonance"" immediately sets the tone with an urgent battle cry of pounding drums, thick, crunching guitar leads, and howling vocals patched in from the bowels of hell. After a thunderous, mid-section assault of double-kick and a sledgehammer beatdown as finisher, Terminal Nation shift gears into overdrive by propelling the listener straight into the thresher of ""Arsenic Earth,"" a two-minute tumult of morbid death-metal and destructive power-violence.    It's this sinister sonic approach — brutally heavy moments of pain, suffering, and lasting violence, infused with an all-consuming sense of doom and gloom — that forms much of  Holocene Extinction 's 13 tracks and lean 35-minute runtime. ""Thirst to Burn"" and ""Leather Envy"" are explosive, ephemeral ragers, blown apart by drummer Chase Davis' frantic blast beats and frontman Stan Liszewski's volatile lyrical screeds (""Death to all fucking bootlickers!""; ""Those who bow to their own oppressor are the weakest link in the chain of being""). Likewise, brief cuts ""Caskets of the Poor"" and single ""Master Plan"" allow axe-men Tommy Robinson and Dalton Rail to build on a template of stomping metallic hardcore, flirting with serpentine death metal leads and thrash-y chainsaw riffage.    While the doom-laden instrumental ""Expired Utopia"" is a welcome reprieve from the album's non-stop assault, it does feel meandering and under-written as the start to side B of the record. Closer ""Age of Turmoil"" has the album's best display of savage vocal interplay, as Liszewski, Robinson, Rail, and bassist Chase Turner aggressively trade barks before the track transitions into an underwhelming, fade-out finish. Elsewhere, Liszewski's delivery and cadence can feel a little awkward and clumsy, stretching or jamming weird lyrical phrases into otherwise excellent track segments (see the ""arf arf!"" moment in ""Orange Bottle Prison"" or the mid-section of the title track).    However, when they hit that ideal three-minute zone, Terminal Nation strike their best material yet, comfortably standing toe-to-toe with the output of fellow contemporaries like  Xibalba ,  Nails  and  Power Trip . Back-end numbers like ""Death For Profit"" and ""Disciple Of Deceit"" lurch and groan under the weight of penetrating riffs, venomous lyrics, piercing dive-bombs, and colossal pit-worthy breakdowns.    Much like the cackling reaper that adorns  Holocene Extinction 's surreal, eye-catching album artwork (courtesy of scene-staple illustrator Adam Burke), Terminal Nation only have one message for the power-hungry sycophants who dare to stand in their way:  time's up .

2020-08-07,Alisha Mughal,8,"EP,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Toronto Indie Rockers BLANKS Are Set to Break Out with Debut EP 'Beyond These Walls',,"Beyond These Walls , the debut EP by Toronto-based power popsters  BLANKS , is so great I wish it were a full-length album. Packing a new wave-tinged punch, the four-track EP is something deeply entrenched in present-day anxieties, but clothed in a strangely familiar sound — the trappings of an instant classic.     The words speak to complex and contemporary anxieties and sadnesses. Consider the  cramped music video  for ""Looking For,"" which nods to the overbearing feeling of the end of times that's damping our thoughts. Guitarist Lewis Caunter's voice at the end of the track haunts like a heartbreaking wail. Likewise, the final track ""Lemon Juice"" conveys a sadistic kind of hope, all the more relatable because of its fallibility. The lyrics on this track, and indeed the entire EP, don't sandpaper the prickliness of these ideas and feelings — the words are cerebral and febrile in a brief sort of way, like Joan Didion's hyphenated prose.    The music, meanwhile, is reminiscent of something you might have grown up with: the guitars roar like in a Blondie song — becoming deep, smoky, and guttural on ""Red Tide"" — and lead singer Dylan Taylor's voice is so much like Brandon Flowers's, beautiful and broad, but also controlled. This band has a keen ear for hooks, and each track is a perfect unit unto itself, expertly crafted.     Beyond These Walls  will get you thinking but also dancing, but also maybe sad. Regardless, it will leave you wanting more.

Comprised of a single 35-minute track, the first two-thirds of the project bring to mind  Brian Eno 's late '70s and early '80s gossamer templates and the spaciousness of  Aphex Twin 's early albums, with O'Rourke navigating ambient sounds both earthy and celestial, protean and futuristic, buoyant and contractive.    It's not until the third section of the work – from approximately the 24 minute mark until around the 32 minute mark, if you're keeping track – that the composition integrates distinctly melodic elements. Atsuko Hatano's textural violin and viola interweave with Eivind Lønning's languorous trumpet, one part  Kind of Blue  meets one part free jazz meets two parts avant-garde digitalia. Around the 29-minute mark,  Eiko Ishibashi 's Erik Satie-esque piano part enters the mix, surrounded by static alternately reminiscent of water and wind. The composition closes with the instrumentation fading into a feathery ambience, a motific return to the album's minimalistic opening.    Some listeners may regard  Shutting Down Here  as lacking in sublimity or sonic theatrics, the type of riveting evocations one encounters contemporarily with the music of  Nicolás Jaar  or  the Soft Pink Truth .  Shutting Down Here  is indeed more subtly rendered, and O'Rourke is more interested in sustaining a low-grade tension than facilitating seismic conflicts and resolutions. In this way, his new album can be regarded as a sonic illustration of existential ambivalence, a fundamental and irresolvable human state that transcends cultural, social, and political trends. A committed listen to O'Rourke's latest iteration reveals the piece to be understatedly eloquent, its movements and progressions restrained yet effective.

2020-08-11,Allie Gregory,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC","With 'Show Pony,' Orville Peck Solidifies His Place as One of Country's Greats",,"In the two short years since releasing his debut single ""Big Sky,"" masked heartthrob  Orville Peck  has experienced a meteoric rise from local scene veteran to verified celebrity. He's largely credited with popularizing 2019's wave of contemporary alt-country — and in closing out that chapter with his latest EP,  Show Pony , it's clear that he'll continue demanding the attention he deserves.    His new project — touting a  big-get feature  from Canadian country icon  Shania Twain  — is undoubtedly steeped in major-label steez, rocking twangier-than-ever vocals, ballad-focused arrangements and narrative-driven lyrics. The six-track entry is the laid-back answer to  Pony 's call, but it's filled with just as much power, drama and bravado as its predecessor. Here, Peck recounts the same lonesome cowboy stories that earned him his stripes last year. Having spent hundreds of days of back-to-back touring during  his 2019 breakthrough , it seems that he's now had time to reflect on his travels — stepping back from sappy love songs to straight, no-chaser Western grit.    Previously released singles  ""Summertime""  and ""No Glory in the West"" follow in the steps of his canonical materials, where tracks like ""Drive Me Crazy"" and ""Kids"" employ more of his newly-brandished pop sensibilities. The latter tracks evoke the minor-key vulnerability of  Avril Lavigne ,  Alanis Morissette  and even  Lady Gaga 's brief country foray in 2011,  Born This Way  cut  ""Yoü and I.""    Peck has always shown himself to be an educated appreciator of music,  taking to livestreams  and gigs to perform covers of classics from  Dolly Parton ,  Kenny Rogers  and  Whitney Houston , alongside takes on hits from  Ariana Grande ,  Lana del Rey  and  FKA twigs . This mixture of old and new classics come together in the record's monumental collaboration with Twain. ""Legends Never Die"" is as close as you're likely to get to radio country for Peck, which is in no way a means to discredit the effort. It's quite the opposite — where mainstream country is undeniably catchy, albeit soulless, here Peck meets its calibre and rises above it. It's a county-fair-meets-Broadway self-fulfilling prophecy: legends never die. For her contribution, Twain delivers an uncharacteristically gravelly vocal performance on the track, lending to its integrity as a certified future golden oldie.    That considered, Twain's feature isn't even the best song on the record. Rather, it's the album closer, the five-minute rework of  Reba McEntire 's (Bobbie Gentry-written) ""Fancy,"" that, through Peck's rich baritone, becomes an unmistakable queer anthem: ""I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow / That I's gonna be a lady someday / Though I don't know when or how,"" he sings. Complete with rattlesnake sound effects and a twisted, ripping guitar solo, the song is a gothic, postmodern take on the hit popularized back in the '90s.    As short a release as it is, the tight six-track EP packs a punch. This is essential material for both country listeners and fans of Orville Peck, who, through his dedication to authenticity in aesthetics, joins the likes of Shania, Reba, Dolly,  Johnny , Kenny,  Merle ,  Hank  and countless others among the genre's greats. Like his forefathers and mothers, it's Peck's penchant for timelessness that will help the release hold its weight for years to come.

With the current state of the world being one of unyielding misery and discontent, one would be forgiven for throwing their hands up, revelling in the ""doomer"" memes and embracing a thoroughly existential soundtrack for these end times. After all, even  Taylor Swift  is  infusing her chameleonic pop with dark and morbid sensibilities , a move that could almost be  ripped straight from the frost-bitten trve kvlt playbook .    With this nihilistic context in mind, Denver trio  Primitive Man  have returned with  Immersion , their bleak, aggressive third full-length and follow-up to 2013's  Scorn  and 2017's formidable  Caustic . On their latest six-track LP, Primitive Man have painstakingly moulded seething rage, acerbic ferocity and cacophonous lurching into a malevolent morass of glacial sludge and obsidian doom metal.    The listener feels the full weight of this aural assault within the first ten seconds of lead single and album opener ""The Lifer."" Joe Linden's thunderous percussion and Jonathan Campos's earth-shaking bottom end give way to guttural hell-spawn bellows, as guitarist and vocalist Ethan Lee McCarthy roars through nearly eight minutes of lumbering riffage and vitriolic self-hatred. With a mental spotlight on the struggles of creative stagnation, sacrifice and ""monetization of the self,"" McCarthy's lyricism turns pointedly inward: ""I used to be grounded / But true reality is hell / And hell is hell / Smothering and cruel.""    Acting as waypoints between the record's more extended compositions, tracks like ""Entity"" and ""∞"" serve as broadcasts from a purgatorial wasteland of droning ambience and ear-piercing feedback. Album centrepiece ""Menacing"" is the raw, bloody, beating heart of  Immersion , pulsing with Primitive Man's restless energy and innate savagery. McCarthy and Campos unfurl churning riffs against Linden's chaotic blast-beats before the track sinks deep into a murky, whirring dirge. Here, McCarthy's stark anguish is suddenly — and violently — retched outward at a meaningless world devoid of promise and divine purpose: ""Nature / Rapes / Nurture / Vomit / Earth / Why did God make me to scream out of my fucking soul?""    Alongside their contemporaries in  Bell Witch  and  Cult Leader , Primitive Man have become experts at utilizing their subterranean dynamic range to excavate dramatic tension and contemplate the void. ""Foul"" settles in on McCarthy's repetitive guitar motif, interspersing moments of grim silence with Linden's tom bursts and Campos' bass rumblings. Album closer ""Consumption"" is front-loaded with last-minute fury, bristling with tectonic fills and screeching guitars that slowly ring out into the expanse of a lifeless abyss. One noticeable complaint, however, is the length. With  Immersion  clocking in at a brisk yet entirely oppressive 36-minutes, the album sits narrowly ahead of 2015's  Home Is Where the Hatred Is  EP and trails well behind  Scorn  and  Caustic .    But make no mistake,  Immersion  is heavy in almost every conceivable sense of the word. It's the creative result of hatred and disgust and malice, of embracing the downfall of human civilization with a bitter sneer and a complete lack of remorse. It's the sonic equivalent of a black hole — dark, violent, unfathomably dense — rapaciously devouring all light and matter, ripping apart the very fabric of spacetime. It's about as close as we can get to hearing the entropic heat death of the universe and our slow, inexorable march to nothingness. And frankly, we deserve every single second of it.

Present  shows that creative duo Nancy Urich and  Seth Smith  paid close attention to their musical surroundings while  focusing their attention on film . The familiar gloom of their past records remains while their poppy post-punk-ish sound takes a more current, trendy approach to dreamy nostalgia.    Much of the original Dog Day lineup returns for  Present , with the addition of Meg Yoshida on keys. Her arrival shows off the band's evolution, with the keys pushing some of the tracks from good to great. The reverb-soaked synth juxtaposed against the melodic sweetness of ""Start It Up"" takes the edge off the angst both — on the track and the record as a whole. Lyrics like ""Let's meet behind the old shopping mall / Talk about the future with no care at all"" reek of a suburban teen cynicism that the album delivers throughout.    The moodiness of  Present  reflects the trends of recent Canadian indie rock as a whole. The popularity of beachy, throwback jangle over the last few years is undeniable, and Dog Day has followed suit. Their nostalgic flare most likely comes from two places: '00s alternative and early new wave. ""You Were You"" has the repetitive composition and angst of  Broken Social Scene , while ""Pictures on the Wall"" checks in with its ""fellow talking heads.""

2020-08-13,Sarah Chodos,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,PUNK",8 Inch Betsy's 'The Mean Days' Is a Vital Expression of Community-Building,,"Music, at its best, is a statement in a larger conversation.  The Mean Days  by  8 Inch Betsy  is a particularly great example of this.     The Mean Days  is a collection of 14 songs being released digitally five and a half years after the tragic death of lead singer Meghan Galbraith. The album was first released in 2015, just months after Galbraith's death, though the recent release is the first digital one. Galbraith's memory lives on in the hearts of a wide range of people — from Chicago then-mayor Rahm Emanuel to the clientele at the café where she worked to the kids at Girls Rock! Chicago where she volunteered. She was the cornerstone of a community. In addition to fostering community in Chicago, 8 Inch Betsy toured the U.S. many times.    8 Inch Betsy was classified as queercore — an offshoot of punk that rejects both society's heterosexism and the classism of many LGBTQ subcultures. All of the members of the final lineup of 8 Inch Betsy identified as queer, though the lyrics generally expressed universal sentiments and emotions, rather than specifically queer topics. The influences of riot grrrl and various sounds of the '80s and '90s (grunge, surf-punk, alternative, hardcore) can be heard. This music is another take on what it means not only to reject the prevailing society but to build a new one.    The vocals are no-nonsense without being abrasive — apparently this reflects Galbraith's personality, too. The music is punk without forgoing such things as complexity and technical proficiency. All of the instruments are played well. Each song has a discernible melody and sounds different from the previous one. ""True North"" combines a thudding bass riff with high pitched guitar chords; ""12 Water"" is slow and contemplative, with Galbraith's voice almost whispering, ""We're both so cold,"" which is followed by and contrasted with the rapid ""Get in the Van."" The sound is arresting — unsettling, perhaps, but not unpleasant.     The Mean Days  captures the feeling of being at a politically charged punk show. Meghan Galbraith is gone, but the music lives on and her influence remains; the path she forged will always be a little bit clearer.

2020-08-05,Matt Bobkin,9,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC",'Microphones in 2020' Crystallizes Phil Elverum's Lifetime of Soul-Searching,,"As a society, we are stuck. At a time when the present moment seems so overwhelming and confusing, sometimes the only places we can turn to are the caverns of our own histories, digging into the treasure troves of our pasts in our search for answers.     Phil Elverum  has been doing that that for some time now. The  death of his first wife , Geneviève Castrée, from pancreatic cancer in 2016 led to a pair of  Mount Eerie  albums, 2017's  A Crow Looked at Me  and 2018's  Now Only , where Elverum forwent his typical, amorphous sonic landscapes for a series of brittle confessions about the precariousness of life, the totality of loss, and the frayed ways in which one can move forward from such a harrowing reality.    As if things couldn't get more complicated, Elverum ended up in a  brief but high-profile marriage  to Hollywood actor  Michelle Williams , who had experienced the death of her ex-partner Heath Ledger a decade earlier, which led to a temporary move to Brooklyn. Once the relationship had ended, Elverum retreated further into his past, reuniting with  Julie Doiron  for  a sequel  to their 2008 collaboration  Lost Wisdom .     And now he's retreated further still, into  the Microphones , the moniker he adopted as a teenager for his earliest recordings. Like the way one might regress to a childhood self when visiting family for a weekend, Elverum has embraced the sound and state of his youth as he processes his past — in search of answers, maybe? In search of peace and familiarity against an uncertain future? The answers, as they always are with Elverum, are unclear.    The act of searching is the point, as Elverum riffles through a lifetime of events, thoughts and feelings over the course of a single, 44-minute song, ""Microphones in 2020,"" that comprises the entirety of his latest album, his first as the Microphones since abandoning the name for Mount Eerie 15 years ago, a decision he discusses near the end of the track. Though sonically similar, it's almost the opposite lyrically of his music from that time. As a young man, Elverum distilled his thoughts and feelings into vivid images of nature's vastness compounded by the smallness of being human, like a lone silhouette illuminated by a lamppost in the middle of a rainstorm. Here, moments are specific and nuanced, crumpled by decades of hindsight and emotional wear-and-tear, but with an unequivocal reverence for his past and the way that it would shape his future.    A counterpoint to his earliest albums, ""Microphones in 2020"" is filled with many straight-laced lyrical and sonic references to his oeuvre, as a form of continuity for himself and certainly a bonus for his many longtime devotees. Whether starting with the ragged strums that recall the intro to 2000's  It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water , the direct rip of a standout lyric from the title track to his 2001 opus  The Glow Pt. 2 , or the various names and fragments from countless other Elverum works, ""Microphones in 2020"" is a Phil Elverum memoir in the way that only Phil Elverum himself can tell — vast stretches of sonic oceans, deserts and plains, anchored by acoustic guitars with electric overdubs for emphasis, a collage of his memories made quite literal by the accompanying music video, featuring archival photos from Elverum's life stacked rhythmically and thematically to the song. (In the song, he likens it to ""filling a long merch table with artifacts, looking back to see if I could draw a map that leads to now."")    In spite of its amorphous, single-song format, the song is remarkably structured, continually anchored by the weight of the specificity of Elverum's recall. Much of the imagery should be familiar to longtime listeners — plenty of rainstorms and being at the mercy of nature and the universe; musical influences and contemporaries like  Eric's Trip ,  Sonic Youth  and  Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy ; the begrudging necessity of technology in the primitive days of internet; Elverum's lifelong preoccupation with death, changing states and the image of something glowing — but beneath the specificity lies a humility and simplicity, though the arrangements are anything but simple. Elverum's not seeking a profound truth; he's just looking inward. The future is always uncertain — Elverum knows that more than most — but he has carved out a comfort in the past, even at its most fraught and tumultuous, and uses it to ease woes about what might come next.    ""Microphones in 2020"" is the kind of memory-searching salvo an artist might make while only on the brink of death, a subject that has been on Elverum's mind decades before it would be the subject of his later-career renaissance. And where fellow '90s upstart  Mark Kozelek , who also followed up his morbid opus (2014's  Benji  as  Sun Kil Moon ) with a series of personal ramblings, each more unhinged and pointless than the last, Elverum continues to thrive in the caverns of his own history, remaining somehow egoless while strongly, deeply rooting his work in his own experiences. This is Elverum's indelible stamp of style, distilled into a single track that flows like waves in the ocean or hills on the mountainside. Because what is life if not one long song, anyway? ( P.W.

""Mood Everyday (Intro)"" establishes the theme of the tape; she's a confident rapper with no shortage of haters trying to catch up to her talents. Her assertive delivery is met with a cult following screaming her lyrics back to her.    Milli's bold statements are most proudly heard on ""Beef FloMix,"" a song about self-love with uplifting lines that would probably find their way onto Forever 21 T-shirt slogans if they weren't bankrupt. It's the first track containing her tagline, ""Flo Milli shit, bitch,"" a simple intro that captures her self-assuredness in a way that hits likes caffeine.    Her personality is further conveyed by her pop culture preferences: ""Send the Addy"" starts off with the iconic ""X-Games mode"" Vine to downplay the tune's abrasiveness, while ""May I"" interpolates  Snoop Dogg 's ""Gin & Juice."" She also released a video for ""Weak,"" which samples the  SWV  song of the same name and puts a spin on their sensual sound. ""Not Friendly"" plays with steel drums in a way that subverts the instrument's intrinsic positivity, achieving a dark aura on a song boasting her hard exterior.     On  Ho, why is you here ? , Flo Milli separates herself from the crowded field of young women who are transforming the alternative rap scene through her appeal — her valley girl flow occasionally sneaks in and her lyrics represent a strong sense of self-sufficiency and individuality. Her omnipresent fanbase from TikTok and Twitter work in concert with the boss bitch energy a Flo Milli song brings, generating plenty of hype for any listener.

2020-08-05,Matthew Blenkarn,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",New Fries Streamline Their Esoteric Sound on 'Is the Idea of Us',,"New Fries  are a hard band to pin down. Unconcerned with traditional songwriting, the Toronto no wave group have made their name on short, proudly unconventional compositions. Many of their older tracks pinball from hypnotic grooves to atonal noise and back again, while others are caustic enough to cut through straightforward structures.    In a catalogue full of anomalies,  Is the Idea of Us  is another departure. Arriving after a four-year break and the exit of synth player Ryan Carley, it finds the band's original trio stripping down and picking up unfamiliar instruments. Surprisingly, the result is their longest and most accessible record; it redefines what New Fries can sound like without betraying their experimental ethos.    Chalk it up to a stylistic shift: where previous albums cribbed from DNA and  Lydia Lunch ,  Is the Idea of Us  offers a more skeletal version of dance punk. Anni Araujo Spadafora's busy bass playing and Jenny Gitman's syncopated cymbals make ""Lily"" sound like a turn-of-the-century track from  the Rapture , and Tim Fagan's jittery guitar harmonics on ""L'Express"" recall  Silent Alarm -era  Bloc Party .    If these comparisons suggest a cathartic rock record, think again.  Is the Idea of Us  is a more patient effort, building songs out rather than blowing them up, but New Fries haven't abandoned their esoteric impulses entirely. Here, they're channeled into seven ambient snippets – each titled ""Genre"" – which offer refreshing digressions between longer tracks. Spadafora's unique lyrical approach also remains intact. Modernistic, arcane and repetitive, her writing is both jarring and thrillingly idiosyncratic.     Is the Idea of Us  may be New Fries' least erratic release to date, but the trio has hardly become complacent. Their music remains as urgent and unpredictable as ever.

Æpoch 's newest release,  The Scryer , is an incredibly ambitious effort from the Cambridge, Ontario-based band.     Æpoch's skill have always been impressive but with their newest release, it has become undeniable. Restraining the juvenile desire to establish technical dominance through the sheer density of notes played, displays a maturing of their writing process resulting in thoughtful compositions. Flirtations with prog still appear throughout the album but never become pretentious, with a notable example being the acoustic prelude that invokes a brief memory of  Opeth .    Despite the additional flavouring, Æpoch remain deeply rooted in their death/thrash level of speed, delivering finely tuned and purposeful transitions and brutal riffs that make this album so impressive. The ravenous energy captured on  The Scryer  presents a band that are hungry with a desire for distinction from their Canadian peers.

Their latest album,  Pick It Up , has a salt-of-the-earth quality about it. This is music for mountains, farms and prairies. Angus, the lead singer, has a voice reminiscent of  Darius Rucker , Steve Harwell of  Smash Mouth , or George Ezra. The folk-country, '90s grunge and indie elements are all apparent.    Angus and bandmate/partner Kirty – a prolific, Orilia, ON-raised, Humber-schooled multi-instrumentalist – share an apartment next to their studio. He refers to the other members of the band – Lewis as well as Kevin Black, Nick McKinlay and Lisa Lorenz – as his best friends. Title track ""Pick it Up"" is both the story of battling through crippling depression and also an ode to social isolation as the video includes footage he took traveling around Toronto filming all of the members from a distance. There is a real warmth projected through the album.    ""Pick It Up"" has a fascinating, trippy intro, which is very different from the rest of the song, but is coordinated seamlessly so as not to be jarring. ""ISO Radio"" is a 42-second track that plays with static and distortion. ""Made for You"" is a sweet love song with a simple melody but also uses electronic sounds. ""Hallelujah, What's It to Ya?"" is an homage to Angus's religious upbringing (one he does not follow as an adult), which gets to the essence of religion by celebrating life.    On  Pick It Up , the down-to-earth dances with the experimental. Fast Romantics are a band that convey a real comfort zone but also are not afraid to step out of it.

2020-08-05,Chris Ayers,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Snakeblade Goes Beyond Black Metal Trappings on 'The Kingdom',,"While the world was put on pause by the coronavirus lockdown, East Vancouver native Mike Redston used his time to record the debut album for his one-man black metal outfit Snakeblade. Snarling vocals? Check. Machine-gun drums? Check. Illegible band logo? Check. But Snakeblade goes beyond the usual black metal trappings by incorporating tastefully melodic guitar solos from local Canadian acts, with lyrical content derived from Redston's love of video games, fantasy literature, and encyclopedic knowledge of  Game of Thrones .     ""When Kingdoms Collide"" opens the proceedings with an impenetrable wall of blast beats, after which the dual-guitar tracks invoke the dulcet tones of  the Fucking Champs . These guitar chords give the track space to explore some Carcass-inspired thrash riffage, and Redston's vicious caterwaul is like a wedding of  Carcass 's Jeff Walker and  Endstille 's Iblis. Referencing one of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth monsters, ""To the Pits with the Balrog"" features strong gang choruses and a searing solo from Devan Howes of Vancouver death metal band Kayas.    Redston has mixed enough power metal riffs in ""The Nine"" to make black metal sound triumphant. The track silences the screams halfway through with a Mindrot-styled acoustic interlude, while ""Scavenger"" performs a similar trick with shades of the ""diabolus in musica"" tritone interval made famous in  Black Sabbath 's iconic self-titled song.  Anthrax -esque thrash can be discerned near the end of ""Devoted to Destruction,"" amid densely packed, galloping black metal measures and the fretboard graces of Matthew Pancoust of Maple Ridge miscreants Truent.    It's safe to say that Snakeblade's musical genius will quickly outgrow Redston's one-man credo, for other musicians will surely seek out his vision. That he has crafted such venomous metal that is still wildly entertaining during this pandemic is a huge accomplishment, and  The Kingdom  will appeal to fans of this black metal style, particularly followers of  Mayhem ,  Borknagar  and classic  Slayer .

2020-08-05,Gen Handley,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,METAL AND HARDCORE,MUSIC",Misery Signals Prove Why They're Metalcore Survivors on 'Ultraviolet',,"In a genre where bands have come and gone, who found mainstream success when the metalcore scene was at its peak and then faded into obscurity,  Misery Signals  are a band that have managed to weather that storm and remain powerful and inspired – and their long-anticipated fourth album,  Ultraviolet , is resounding proof of that.    As the first album with the band's original lineup since their 2004 debut,  Of Malice and the Magnum Heart , Ultraviolet displays all of the chemistry and passion that had people pay attention in the early 2000s when the scene was flooded by similar-sounding bands, but bands less distinctive and with not as much depth.    It is this complex vehemence that is immediately evident on the aptly titled album opener, ""The Tempest,"" setting the tone for the album which tranquilly draws the listener in before frontman Jesse Zaraska breaks the serenity with his impassioned, brutal vocals. And like a violent storm, there is catharsis in the violent gales and rain, an uplifting song that begins with the lyrics, ""We will be lifted again / Let this bring light / Nurture those starry eyes, old friend, for this is not your time / Mend those broken wings and reset, we will make this right.""  Ultraviolet  is a fitting title, as UV light has two sides — a wavelength that is both beneficial and harmful to life. This dual personality is present throughout the album with moments that are, at times, melodic and serene, or heart-wrenching and intense. A good example of this is ""The River King,"" which initially beckons the listener in with calming, haunting vocals before the inevitable onslaught of Zaraska's intense screams.    Texturally, the album is captivating, particularly on ""Through Vales of Blue Fire,"" in which pulsating guitars paint a haunting picture of industrial furnaces bellowing sweltering flames of blue fire. The hopeful ""Redemption Key"" is another memorable example that ebbs and flows with the raw emotions of the song's pensive lyrics.    Many critics dismiss metalcore as a creatively limited genre that is stuck to a proven, particular formula, brooding in the shadows of its more credible and accepted parents, metal and hardcore. But  Ultraviolet  confidently brings Misery Signals out of the umbra of the genre's forefathers, casting a bright, fiery light on a band who will hopefully continue to raise the bar and challenge expectations.

2020-08-06,Owen Torrey,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Matthew Grimson's Posthumous 'Prize for Writing' Finally Brings the Halifax Hero to the Rest of the World,,"It's a late July evening in 2018, and there's barely room to stand in Gus' Pub — an unofficial landmark in Halifax's live music scene. From the small slice of stage in the corner of the bar, singer  Joel Plaskett  addresses the crowd, a guitar cradled against his chest. ""I was 16,"" Plaskett says, ""and Matt would have been about 23."" Plaskett, like everyone else here, has come tonight to remember  Matthew Grimson  — a local singer-songwriter who passed away just a few weeks before at the age of fifty.    It's fitting that Grimson would be remembered in a room like this. After all, the artist was best known as a figure in Halifax's independent music community, his knotty lyricisms aired into scattered venues around the area. During his life, Grimson's work had an intense regional specificity — carried only as far as an amplifier could reach, remaining largely unheard outside of his hometown.    With  Prize for Writing  — a posthumous collection, as well as the artist's first release on 12-inch vinyl — Grimson's work at last assumes form. The album provides a fortunate chance for his songs to be heard and held widely, in a way they seldom were during his life. What emerges is a rare, rambling collection, with lyrics that bite and give in the same breath, extending a welcome invitation to a unique talent in Canadian songwriting.    Co-curated as a ""labour of love"" by Plaskett alongside Chris Murphy of  Sloan , the raw materials for the record date from a recording session of Grimson's in 1995. As a general rule, the volume is loud, the production is brash. Most tracks are slim — often expiring before the two-minute mark — but deceptively roomy, holding worlds in their detailed dioramas of emotional states.    In constructing these scenes,  Prize for Writing  makes good use of Grimson's greatest asset: a precise intuition for the weight and shape of an image. When sharpest, his writing is at once concrete in its references — late-night bars, fortune cookies, a Christmas wreath — and amorphous in its meanings. ""I'd like to eat your apple on a Saturday night / I'd like to ride your appaloosa on the Isle of the Wight,"" he sings on ""Get Lost Helen of Troy."" There's a loose, associative logic to these lines that's not unlike how poet Kenneth Koch describes the best of poetry, as allowing ""a nonsensical statement… to be something — even in a certain way to be memorable.""    It's tempting to hear  Prize for Writing  as chiefly a thing of memory — an archival document permitting Grimson's work to be recalled by those who knew him, discovered by those who didn't. And though the release generously fills this retrospective role, viewing it in this light obscures how alive — how present — these songs still feel. When Grimson delivers simple, indisputable lines like, ""I feel good, at this place, at this time,"" you believe him. After all, the goodness he's talking about is right there with you — reaching whatever place, whatever time you might be tuning in from.

Several of the tracks successfully revisit signature elements of the singer-songwriter's best work –  Magnolia Electric Co. 's ""Farewell Transmission"" and ""Hold on Magnolia,""  Didn't It Rain 's ""Blue Chicago Moon,""  What Comes After the Blues 's ""Hammer Down,"" and  Ghost Tropic 's ""Incantation,"" among others – though taken as a whole, the project largely occurs as a series of drafts or truncated sketches.    ""Whisper Away,"" the album's opener, commences with birdsong, an audial symbol of ebullience that contrasts effectively with the song's minor chords and Molina's etherial yet tortured vocal: ""Whisper away the howling universe / …Whisper away your last smile."" The track captures Molina's career-defining angst, epitomizing his slowcore/lo-fi proclivities.    ""Shadow Answers the Wall"" revels in apocalyptic tones, though the piece fails to fully translate prior to its abrupt ending. Josh Hillman's viola part on ""Old Worry"" defines the song's emotional tint as much as or more than Molina's voice or lyrics. ""Fire on the Rail"" features Molina's talent for sublimely archetypal imagery: ""Fire in the field / …Fire on the rail / Engine, oh my engine / Fire on the prairie.""    The album closes with ""The Crossroad + the Emptiness,"" poeticizing the inevitability of death and oblivion (""Remember we were the nameless ones""). As the project opened with birdsong, so it closes with it too, alluding, perhaps, to the possibility of peace and wholeness beyond our earthly traumas.    While  Eight Gates  seems mostly germinal and is not the ideal introduction to Molina's work, fans will likely forgive the album's inchoateness and simply appreciate another dollop of the artist's distinct melancholia — nine tunes that underscore his attunement to suffering, inconsequence, and the brutality of the corporeal world.

Best known as guitarist and vocalist for post-metal legends  Neurosis , Von Till's newest solo album is composed of dark, spacious ambient arrangements anchored by solemn, soothing vocals.    The collection's singular evocative space is built from moods, tones and textures that strike as almost spiritual in nature. The sense of this is made even more coherent through the lyrics.  No Wilderness Deep Enough  arrives with  Harvestman: 23 Untitled Poems and Collected Lyrics , a new book by Von Till containing pieces from his solo career and Harvestman project. The writing throughout this book, which includes the lyrics to  No Wilderness Deep Enough , is cryptic and insightful, and often connected through natural and existential themes.    Opener ""Dreams of Trees"" invites the listener into the album's engrossing and haunting atmosphere, with shimmering echoes and deep tones that tremble at the edges with static. The cello, pulses and piano of ""Indifferent Eyes,"" accompanied by Von Till's gruff, earnest delivery, showcase a knowingness behind the lyrics that is present throughout the album and unfolds more with every listen. ""Shadows on the Run"" is reminiscent of some of  Jóhann Jóhannsson 's chilling neo-classical, except more foreboding. Instrumental elements build, some twinkling and melancholic, others pulsing and thick. Closer ""Wild Iron"" has a feeling of relief and openness. Von Till's voice echoes overtop of a rippling sonic expanse, with one of the album's best lines: ""The silent stories we tell ourselves / Map the terrain of our true nature.""    This is an album of slow, beautiful progressions and layering. The mix of instrumentation grounded by deep, gothic vocals gives the collection a subtly psychedelic and calming feel.

With deeply personal themes, this unlikely mélange of musical styles feels like a strange party.    The opening track, ""Barely Alive,"" begins with gentle vocals and a simple melody until an almost industrial drumbeat is introduced. The single,  ""Talking Out Loud,""  is more pop-friendly, albeit in a dark vein; the video is composed of blue and purple trippy images that convey the sound of the music.    The final track, ""Fuckers,"" is slow and piercing with a simple melody and an atonal, buzzing string sound in the background.    The album's styles are tied together by an orchestral level of arrangement, combining digital and analogue and, most importantly, blending simple loveliness with unsettling complexity. Glenham's voice is rich and pretty, with misty harmonies rising in the background.    What gives it depth is the personal and inherently collaborative nature of the music.

In this album, Brandy explores the way we love, whether for ourselves or another. Authenticity is present on this album; she confidently steers her own ship by taking a new approach by writing every song on the album to create something personal. Her maternal instincts are strong on this project, as if she's raising the young girl she debuted as. Brandy was ahead of the curve she shaped herself, having spent the last 30 years perfecting and adapting — now she draws her own lines. She was the moment in the '90s, and now she is the moment in 2020.    The fifteen songs on the album take us on a turbulent trip on the Brandy train, detailing the ups and downs of the past few years of her life, as the concept of love permeates through every track in any way possible, in every interpretation available. ""No Tomorrow"" smoothly — and slightly nihilistically — celebrates a romance and the immediacy of indulging in infatuation, to reduce regret as if life will cease tomorrow. On ""Borderline,"" Brandy enters a confusing relationship with lots of self-doubt and self-criticism. ""High Heels"" puts Brandy on her humble high horse, where she's queen of the club, and ""Baby Mama"" proudly professes her love for her daughter, Sy'rai. Toronto's own  Daniel Caesar  joins the album on last year's hit ""Love Again."".     B7  is meticulous in its references to pop and R&B history, of which Brandy's own career is such an important facet. The   album art pays homage to her hero, the late  Whitney Houston , and her look from  The Bodyguard . The font on the cover also pays tribute to Brandy's own first few albums, as well as her signature braids from that era, while the album also features new contributions by longtime songwriting collaborator  LaShawn Daniels ,  who died last year , and who Brandy credits for helping her open up and listen to her own voice. Brandy has returned to her roots and the aesthetics that helped popularize her.

Since the New York outfit's beginning, they've architected boldly dark and beautiful worlds that crashed, cracked and crumbled under brooding tensions and human ruin. Imperial Triumphant's newest release,  Alphaville , finds the band once again expanding their momentous metropolitan jungle into new, thrilling forms.    ""Rotted Futures"" opens the album with ominous tones that build into a clamorous wall before dropping into a demented groove with burly bass and sparkling notes. ""Excelsior"" starts like energized freeform jazz before being thrown into a whirlwind of buzzing guitar and off-kilter drumming, and, like most tracks on the album, goes through several transitions before the song's end. ""Transmission to Mercury"" opens with mournful piano and trombone before going through a meat grinder of blast beats, guttural growls and spinning guitars. Choral vocals and horns fill the song's midsection before distant manic screams are wrapped by strangling guitars as the song fades into brief oblivion. The band's masterful ability to cohesively and orchestrally meld dissonance and aggression with jazz and weirdness is uncanny. This ability is present throughout  Alphaville , but ""Atomic Age"" and the title track, its longest songs, find the band showcasing it in full force.     Alphaville  is one of the year's darkest and most deranged collections of avant-garde metal, a surreal dystopian nightmare that is both terrifying and entrancing. Exploration of this world finds unexpected rewards around every twist and turn, in a beautifully jarring and perverse aural realm.

With an incredibly quick turnaround, the album was composed between the end of 2018 and early 2019 and subsequently performed at New York's Merkin Hall as part of Ecstatic Music Festival, in collaboration with the Brooklyn Youth Chorus (the two having collaborated in the past). The result is an album that strays far from Wye Oak's catalogue and studio work, while still being unequivocally rooted in the band's definite experimental format.    Of the five tracks, ""No Place"" stands out, its use of minor chord progressions pulsing with a beautifully melancholic, ominous tone. Rather than call and response, the gossamer vocals of the Brooklyn Youth Chorus are followed by a monotone vocal mirroring of what's been sung, a twinning with Wasner's weighty words.  No Horizon  pairs ecstasy with pensiveness, using experimentation, static, tension and texture to push Wye Oak's skills ever forward.

From raunchy early albums that resemble something like a  South Park  episode set to music, to the boundary-pushing 18-minute punk rock opera  The Decline , and through to the political albums that rally against war criminal presidents and their administrations, NOFX haven't been afraid to progress with, experiment on and hone a signature sound that has become indicative of the genre as a whole.    But after nearly 35 years, NOFX have settled into creating consistently good albums and singles that, although still a testament to the accomplishments of the band, might not catch the attention of new audiences the way their early efforts did. Where is there left to go?    Enter  Frank Turner , who, on the other hand, began his career in music a few decades after NOFX were already a household name. And although Turner's musical sensibilities fall closer to folksy London-set ballads, the throughline of anti-authoritarian, countercultural politics unite the two. Which, while they seem like an unlikely pairing to release a 10-song cover album of each others' songs, results in an undeniably fun, catchy and — at times — surprisingly profound collection of tracks.     Turner's signature songwriting style, through the lens of NOFX's fast-paced and energetic instrumentation, breathes new life into NOFX's sound while still maintaining their own distinctive characteristics. Turner's covers of NOFX classics like ""Bob,"" ""Scavenger Type"" and ""Perfect Government"" are refreshing nostalgic joyrides through the annals of punk rock history. However, it is Turner's stripped-down, haunting cover of ""Falling in Love"" and the driving, bassline-centric ""Eat the Meek"" that not only showcase the depth of NOFX's songwriting brilliance but also allow Turner to highlight his unignorable ability to inject his own creativity and life into tried-and-true hits.    What looks like an odd couple cover album at first glance turns out to be one of the best matched and executed collaborations of which either group have been a part.

Toronto-based musician Jong Lee — explores hopelessness and hopeful romanticism with chilled-out bedroom pop.    The lyrical anxiety is eased by the dreamy, lighthearted melodies and production. This is especially the case with ""Fairytale"", where a romantic air sweeps alongside a happy nonchalance. ""Fairytales and sunshine / moonlight and paradise / And I'm terrified by that,"" sings Lee, crushing the happy-ending tropes of storybook fantasies under the weight of realistic expectations.     In ""Rollercoaster"", a steady beginning subtly rises into a calmly vibrant chorus, with lyrics of love-streaked uncertainty underscored by catchy pop melodies. Romanticism is elevated in ""Your Blue"", slow and dreamy with the addition of cinematic violins. Closing track ""With Me"" projects its mood with yearning guitar riffs as Lee sings, ""Just stay with me until the end' Lee sings,"" putting all the hopelessness and hopefulness into one last plead.     Shimmer 's songs are familiar and accessible, its themes predictable but pleasant. It's the kind of amalgamation of easy-going sounds that are a reminder that there's always sunshine somewhere.

2020-07-31,Ashley Hampson,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Romare Continues His Dance Music Explorations on 'Home',,"As an artist, Archie Fairhurst's output as  Romare  has been so rich and engaging that it's a bit of a surprise that his latest,  Home , is only his third LP. After his first two EPs in 2012 and 2013, however, it seems Fairhurst chose quality over quantity.    Released to international acclaim, his debut  Projections , infused with jazz and blues, relied heavily on vinyl sampling and the exploration of cut and paste, with his work already appearing on compilations like Bonobo's  Late Night Tales . With his return and release of  Love Songs: Part Two , Fairhurst stepped up the variation, often playing large portions of the music himself (his grandmother's recorder, his dad's mandolin, monosynths). And while still sampling vinyl, his sound moved its way into disco and psychedelic.     Home  is the latest in Fairhurst's ever-evolving sounds and production. Shifting ever further away from purely sample-based music, the album settles itself along the lines of funky house and incorporates instruments like a 12-string guitar, drum kit, and a vintage organ found at a local thrift store, which leaves a huge mark across several tracks (""The River"" uses it prominently — the simple, repetitive notes sitting atop hi-hat, ride cymbals, and tight snare).    In a direct nod to the dancefloor, single ""Gone"" is a fantastic example of a track mired in house that uses a slow build — organ and synth working together and the occasional looped vocal thrown in — and unexpected twist to shift the momentum by adding a delicious layer of grime. With progression and reinvention a staple of Romare's work, we can only wait in anticipation for his next release.

It's too often they're used as gap-fillers for bands who haven't released anything in too long and are at risk of being forgotten. Even if they aren't bad — or even if they're great — they still serve only as appetizers and leave fans hungry for actual new material, not re-releases, compilations, or concert recordings.    Septicflesh's  Infernus Sinfonica MMXIX  is not one of those live albums.The concert film and accompanying soundtrack are, in a word, breathtaking. Filmed and recorded at a sold-out show in February 2019 at Mexico City's Metropolitan Theater, this special show saw the Greek symphonic death metal outfit was accompanied for the evening by over 100 musicians from the Symphonic Experience Orchestra, the Enharmonía Vocalis Choir, and the National University of Mexico Children's and Youth Choir.    One of the most impressive things about this show is the band's lack of ego. Septicflesh may not be the biggest name around, at least not yet, but for a band pulling off a spectacle like this, they appear incredibly humble. The band are right in there alongside the orchestra, rather than on a separate, raised stage with the orchestra and choirs hiding in shadows, and what's more, there's no need here for a long, drawn-out intro and entrance. Not even three minutes into the show, the band are already barrelling into opener ""Portrait of a Headless Man.""    The masterfully crafted setlist sees Septicflesh and accompaniment rip through highlights like ""The Pyramid God,"" ""Anubis"" and ""The Vampire from Nazareth"" before arriving at the evening's grand culmination in ""Dark Art,"" with no break in momentum in the nearly hour-and-a-half-long performance. While most of the focus is on the band's latest offering, 2017's  Codex Omega , several tracks off of each of their last four albums are featured, as is typical of Septicflesh's shows these past few years.     Other bands should take note. Only an exclusive, special, months-rehearsed show like this is worth releasing as a live album or concert video. If there's any extreme metal show in recent memory that deserves this treatment, it's this one. Now, if only Septicflesh could bring out an orchestra on every tour.

2020-07-31,Owen Morawitz,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Hockey Dad Slowly Start Growing Up on 'Brain Candy',,"For much of the last decade, Australian duo Hockey Dad have spent their time turning a sense of wistful, care-free nostalgia into a unique brand of catchy surf rock escapism. However, much like the iconic '90s cartoon that supplied their tongue-in-cheek namesake, there's an upper limit to how far that nostalgic turn can take you. Ultimately, it becomes necessary to make a forward-thinking pivot into the unknown and with that action comes a level of inherent risk.    On  Brain Candy , the duo's third full-length album, this uncertainty manifests itself as a foray into new sonic territory, washing up on the shores of '00s indie, alt-rock and shoegaze. The opening combo of  ""In This State"" and ""I Missed Out"" feel like long lost deep cuts from the Arctic Monkeys archive, brimming with Zach Stephenson's breezy guitar leads, drummer Billy Fleming's danceable rhythms, and a whole host of hypnotic refrains and lush vocal harmonies.    Simplistic, laidback cuts like ""Milk in the Sun"" and ""Germaphobe"" will sound immediately familiar to fans of Hockey Dad's 2016 debut  Boronia  and its 2018 follow-up  Blend In . On the muscular ""Good Eye,"" the band level up their sound with a huge stadium-ready riff, as Stephenson uses optics as a metaphor for self-confidence and knowing how to spot the diamonds from the rough. As one of the record's more extended compositions, ""Itch"" epitomizes the mid-tempo summer banger, with dreamy, pulsing verses and an infectious chorus hook.    However, as one would expect for a third album, there's also a touch of seriousness that creeps in at the edges on  Brain Candy . While the warm fuzz of ""Nestle Down"" allows Stephenson to reflect on those upcoming middle stages of adulthood, he's not ready to give up on fleeting carnal pleasures just yet, singing earnestly about not being tied down and ""holding out for the stranger in [his] pocket."" Elsewhere, the churning euphoria of ""Tell Me What You Want"" rails against dead-end 9-to-5s and ""Dole Brother"" channels some throwback garage energy with cheeky back-up harmonies and a playful guitar solo. ""Keg"" and ""Reno"" bring some smooth tropical energy to the mix, balancing the more straight-forward rock ragers with mellow, easy-listening jams.    While  Brain Candy  does lose creative steam towards the back end, there's still plenty here on offer for those looking for a reprieve from the oppressive reality of day-to-day life in 2020. On their latest record, Hockey Dad manage to flirt and reflect on ""big deal"" problems but do so in a way that feels as easy to digest as a fresh beer in the sunshine or dipping your head under a crashing wave. After all, no party lasts forever, but it's still fun while it's happening.

2020-07-31,Dylan Kavalsky,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Amon Tobin Makes Electronics Sound Human on Figueroa's 'The World As We Know It',,"Amon Tobin is a traveller, and not just because he's lived in a variety of countries across the globe. The music producer and composer has worked with electronics for over two decades to explore the possibilities of trip hop, IDM and more. Under the moniker Figueroa, he has released a new record called  The World As We Know It , which marks his first expedition into the trippy forests of psychedelic folk. The Sylvia Massy-produced record is a superb addition to the genre.     The acoustic guitar is a defining feature of the album's style, especially on songs like ""Put Me Under"" and the title track, where he shows off a speedy and mesmerizing finger-picking style. The bass guitar also shines thanks to earworm riffs on ""Weather Girl"" and ""Back to the Stars. Many other instruments help shape this album, such as the drums, which create a sense of mysterious intensity on songs like ""If You Knew My Name"" and ""Better Run.""    Tobin also delivers beautifully harmonized vocals. His dreamy delivery reduce the impact of some of the lyrics by obscuring some of the words, but the tone also captures a level of eeriness and abstraction that mixes well with the album's instrumentation.    Even though Tobin uses an extremely wide range of sounds, the album never gets confusing, because every instrument seems purposeful and comes in at the right moment. It's easy to picture Tobin and Massy conducting seven musicians in a studio at once, but nothing like this ever happened. No musicians performed on this record — every sound was computer-generated, even the hand-muting on the acoustic guitars.    This album truly challenges the idea that electronic music will always lack a human element; machines can actually sound more human than the real thing when artists like Amon Tobin and Sylvia Massy are on the job.

This is the question that haunts  A Hero's Death , the sophomore album from Dublin post-punks Fontaines D.C.     On  Dogrel , their debut, released a mere 15 months ago, they presented themselves as a band out of time; young men besotted by romantic poetry, and sickened by the inauthenticity of modernity that has swept their home town. Praised for its grounded and authenticity and anthemic songwriting,  Dogrel  was showered with accolades, particularly in the UK. Second time out though, having achieved success, the ""Big"" that frontman Grian Chatten once sang about, the quintet seem less sure of what they want, the classic sophomore conundrum.    Taut and tense with a paranoid edge, the album is the guitar-band equivalent of a late-night bus ride, the record presenting a rootless expanse. You can picture members staring out a rain-soaked window at the endless stretch before them. Fittingly,  A Hero's Death  was at least partly inspired by escapist art made by creatives who build up the sonic equivalent of a fantasy world in which to escape.     The band once again bring a welcome dose of colour to a genre known for its bleak monotones. They even inject some beautiful  Beach Boys  harmonies into the brooding ""Sunny.""  Brian Wilson , patron saint of Southern California pop, is an unlikely influence for an Irish post-punk band, but the interiority of his most introspective work can be heard across the record.     The propulsive spark that lit their debut lingers, keeping the record from drifting off into malaise.  There a certainty to their uncertainty. They embrace ambiguity. Fontaines D.C. might be unsure of what they want, but they damn well know what they don't when they see it.

Their  self-titled record  is everything EDM has been missing for the last five years: a wholesome, heartfelt approach to electronic dance music that appeals to emotion before aesthetics.    The collaboration's cinematic entry is underscored by its lead single ""Heart Attack,"" which features the delicate, lush vocals of English singer lau.ra. The melodic approach to this track is especially moving thanks to its coupling with understated percussion, uncommon to the genre. Like the rest of the album, ""Heart Attack"" doesn't hit hard in the traditional sense — it instead aims to plant roots for the rest of the subtle but self-assured record. In a statement, ODESZA called the track ""a turning point in the writing process of the album"" that informed the vocal features on their debut. And it's true — many of the tracks that follow lean into their sentimentality, with only a handful of outliers.    That is shown in  Gallant -featuring mid-album track ""Know Me."" ODESZA fans will immediately recognize the duo's signature spacey, groovy tempo. Meanwhile, Golden Features' distinct, tropically-flavoured production shines through its cracks. This is another downtempo highlight from the front half of  BRONSON , leading into the album's slightly bolder closing chapter. Things take an aggressive turn with ""Tense,"" an overdrive-adjacent tune reminiscent of  Justice 's 2007  Cross  banger ""Stress."" The breakdown toward the end of the track is one not to miss.    As far as ODESZA's output goes, this record will satisfy fans in the interim between 2018's  A Moment Apart  and their next solo release. Golden Features' contributions add a big-tent EDM feel, great for soundtracking the lonesome summer apartment dance parties taking place across the world as we continue to miss out on large-scale festivals affected by COVID-19. The collaboration between the two entities, while, truthfully not nearly a contender for AOTY, marks the beginning of a beautiful friendship that we hope to hear from again in the future.

New York-based, D.C.-born producer and MC  Oddisee  deftly captures the helplessness and hope of our ongoing quarantining with his new  ODD CURE  EP. What's more, he also uniquely conveys the opportunities to rest, reflect and reconnect with loved ones during this slower pace imposed on us by COVID-19.    Oddisee attacks these themes with the same skills he has been honing over the past two decades in rap's underground. That means old school jazzy instrumentals updated with his signature syncopated rhythms, the latter indebted to his Sudanese heritage. It also means relatable, socially conscious lyrics as upbeat as the music, not to mention his ever improving singing on EP highlight ""Go to Mars."" Fans will delight in hearing the veteran rapper smoothly shift from spitting to crooning over that song's jazzy funk instrumental, though more seasoned singer Olivier St.Louis's heftier baritone puts the song over during the chorus. Their lyrics about escaping to space (as if one of Elon Musk's rockets were conveniently attainable) are utterly relatable during this surreal year where COVID-19 and celebrity pipe dreams dominate headlines.    Better still: Oddisee's lyrics on the wistfully languid ""Still Strange."" Over a bass sample stifled by distortion, as if to evoke quarantine cabin fever, Oddisee weaves pandemic vernacular into a relationship metaphor (""don't wash your hands of me"" proving to be a particularly vivid line in 2020). His lines about the unemployment of nonessential workers also match the music's melancholy to a tee.    And while snooty listeners might balk at the ratio of skits to songs on  ODD CURE  (breaking down to about half-half), those interludes are integral to the EP's story. Through frank and funny recordings of phone and Zoom calls with family, friends and colleagues, Oddisee elevates the typically trivial rap skit to essential listening. These moving conversations will remind listeners of how self-isolation has compelled us all to keep better tabs on our loved ones. The skits also compliment the music's sentiments, making  ODD CURE  live up to the title of one of its best tracks: ""No Skips."" You certainly shouldn't skip this musical cure to the quarantine blues.

Last year's sharp and effervescent  Lover  did something to correct that — it found Swift marrying her pop ambitions with her richly specific writing in ways that  1989  and  Reputation  never quite did. And, less than one year later comes  folklore , taking the elusive alchemy that drove  Lover  to new places.     folklore  feels like the culmination of a decade's worth of public growth and artistic fine-tuning. There are no travesties like ""Me!"" or ""Look What You Made Me Do"" that grind the record to a screeching halt, and several songs — ""seven,"" ""mirrorball,"" ""the last great american dynasty"" — stand among her best. Sometimes the folk rebrand feels a bit too on-the-nose — a song called ""cardigan,"" the Sacred Bones-lite album art, the  Bon Iver  duet — but it's surprising how well it all works. What Swift lacks in subtlety she makes up for in her unironic commitment to a bit.    The record is built on softly pattering, near subliminal percussion, twinkling piano, lush swirls of guitar and strings, with much of the album's production helmed by  the National 's  Aaron Dessner . It's a nice fit for Swift, and — thank god — she hasn't lost her knack for solid hooks. However, it's her words that make f olklore  what it is — the record is a powerful reminder that there are no other pop artists doing what she does. Swift's narratives on  folklore  are more blurred and fractured than they once were — songs weave among each other, conversations from different perspectives, different years, told by different voices.    Swift is still unquestionably a pop artist, and  folklore  is unquestionably a pop album, albeit a quiet one — and as is the case with most recent pop albums, it's about four songs too long. It's hard not to wish that Swift would apply her written concision to her tracklisting, to do away with the stream-grabbing bloat and deliver something more thoughtfully tailored.    Still, it's hard to complain about too much of a good thing. Where it ultimately stands within her catalogue will take more time to decipher, but  folklore  nonetheless feels like a watershed moment for Swift. It's proof positive that she's one of our better pop chameleons, and a palette cleanser after several intriguing, if sometimes questionable, sonic detours. Where she'll end up next is anyone's guess.

""leaving"" tugs on heartstrings with its potent reminders of the distance and loneliness of isolation, and the way a long-distance relationship can make you feel like mush. ""hoping"" tackles Tinder and the way in which online dating reshapes the idea of infatuation; the way a dating profile can have you doubting yourself and imagining the realness of an unconsummated e-relationship.

The album closes with ""data,"" an emotional ballad which on the surface seems like a track about USBs and flash drives, but is really about being remembered or forgotten, with the theme of data loss surrounding the entire album.     mydata  shows one woman's interpretation of how isolated intimacy affects us, answering the questions we've all had to ask ourselves over the past few months. Physicality exists in data — your response to any stimulus reflects analytically, and you feel yourself the way no one else can. The realness of emotion still exists in the internet age, it's just inward.

2020-07-28,Paul Blinov,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Land of Talk Find Peace and Quiet Amid 'Indistinct Conversations',,"Scattered across  Land of Talk 's fourth album are interest-piquing fragments of chitchat. You can pick out ""Fuck you, Debbie,"" or ""When the screensaver turns off, I was looking at that"" like you were passing a streetside conversation, but the full context never follows.    The songs around those snippets, however, are vibrant and clear, delivered with dreamy guitar-work and reflective lyrics. Effectively an inversion of its own title,  Indistinct Conversations  finds songwriter Elizabeth Powell amplifying quieter, more internal moments, carving space for clarity amid chatter and fray.    The instrumentation is anchored by acoustics — more than on previous Land of Talk releases— which shapes the intimate atmosphere Powell's exploring. Album opener ""Diaphanous"" uses a steady riff to process personal reflections, while guitars eventually drop out of ""Love in 2 Stages,"" letting Powell's voice and the rhythm section carry key moments.    Fittingly, some of the album's finest moments are its quietest: ""Festivals"" is a gorgeous ode, offering lines like ""If your mouth is a festival, there's a song in the way you speak."" Elsewhere, ""Now You Want to Live in the Light"" offers a minimalist focus: it's mostly strum-and-voice, with additional instrumentation cropping up to underscore what's already there without stealing focus.    Of course, Powell can still plug in and rip up a fretboard when they want to: ""Footnotes"" balances on a recurring, hypnotic riff, and ""A/B Futures"" lets a striding guitar line carry declarations like ""I'm your future lover / there's me, there's no one else."" With that,  Indistinct Conversations  doesn't so much pare back as it does reveal depths: Powell's putting their inner life on display, and giving it the full range of space and volume it deserves.

With  2020 the Album ,  DijahSB  makes that modernization sound like the party of the year. The Toronto MC does so with both celebratory conscious rhymes and astutely selected instrumentals. Prime example: ""C'est la Vie."" On it, they rhyme about catching your girlfriend's eye and tempting those among their audience to toss their bras onstage, as strutting bass, warbling synths and tinny high hats resound with nary a wasted note.    The forward-thinking rhymes are precisely, yet unfussily delivered. With that juxtaposition, DijahSB both evokes and builds upon the legacies of economically cadenced, progressive '80s rappers like Roxanne Shanté and  Queen Latifah . As they pull off those feats, DijahSB is backed up by lean, upbeat production. Be it the rattling percussion and clipped synth squeals of ""Broke Boi Anthem"" or the purring keys and swaggering drums of ""Frontin' Like Pharrell,"" listeners will shimmy shake their shoulders to this eight-track release even as they mull over the project's deeper themes.    The good time vibes are in lockstep with the triumphant narrative DijahSB spins throughout. That is especially apparent on the cash-strapped recollections of ""I'll Pay You Back on Friday"" or expressing gratitude for support systems on ""Mama Said."" By spinning their pain and elation into tracks instantly fit for the dance floor, DijahSB's  2020 the Album  is sure to bring joy and solace to listeners.

2020-07-29,Myles Tiessen,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Le Ren's 'Morning & Melancholia' EP Is Heartbreaking Enough to Make Joni Mitchell Weep,,"Country music has always been a genre where virtuosos in expressing heartbreak and loss painstakingly present their emotional strife for the whole world to listen and criticize. With stakes that high, it's no wonder the genre has gifted the world with some of the greatest songwriters of all time. On her debut EP, Montreal-based singer-songwriter Lauren Spear, also known as  Le Ren , lives up to the standards set by her country and folk idols.    Drifting somewhere between the two genres,  Morning & Melancholia  pays homage to the sounds of a bygone era for both genres, all the while maintaining a secure level of contemporary finesse and approach to crafting songs. Tracks utilize clean chord progressions over an acoustic guitar and feature enough diversity in the production to make each piano line, slide guitar, or synth seem astonishingly intentional.    Written in the wake of her ex-boyfriend's death, the songs on  Morning & Melancholia  deal with themes of solitude, memory, and redefining identity in the aftermath of a catastrophe. The poignancy of Spear's songwriting displays her ability to reach the sentiment of the song without flourishes. Rarely do you find metaphors to dissect or clumsy statements to critique — her lyrics are candid and unequivocal. ""I fell in love at the sight of you / I was taken so overcome."" sings Spear on the opener ""Love Can't Be the Only Reason to Stay."" She continues, ""I gave you all, I got lost in you / Didn't see till it all came undone."" Without wasting a single word, phrase, or syllable, Spear has crafted a collection of four songs written with enough emotional intelligence to make Joni Mitchell weep.     On one of the EP's best tracks, ""If I Had Wings,"" Spear laments the futility of ever trying to see her loved one again. ""If there was a God he'd find it in his heart to let you stay,"" sings Spear before proudly proclaiming, ""If I had wings, yeah, I'd be heaven bound / So I could see your face once more."" Her quivering vocals drift effortlessly over the minimalist strumming of an acoustic guitar and a euphoric slide guitar.    On  Morning & Melancholia , Le Ren deftly showcases her songwriting and ability to capture emotional sorrow while displaying powerful yet subdued instrumentation. Le Ren is no stranger to misery, but the catharsis found in each track makes it clear that for her, there is still beauty found in life's most painful moments.

In addition to singing, Kenney plays guitar, synth, and piano, and is accompanied by  Wye Oak 's Jenn Wasner and Andy Stack, with a collection of guest musicians jumping in for a track or two.    The lead single, ""Sucker,"" is slow and shimmery, with backup vocals by  Lambchop 's Kurt Wagner. While Kenney's voice flows like honey, Wagner's is more speaking than singing, conjuring images of a duet between  Blonde on Blonde -era  Bob Dylan  and  Dolores O'Riordan  at her most melodic The sound changes from song to song but, like a patchwork quilt, maintains a consistent pattern overall. ""Cut the Real"" has a strong electronic beat while ""White Window Light"" features monotonous guitar strumming and vocals that run back and forth between speaking and singing.    The overarching theme of the lyrics is not falling madly in love, nor falling out of love, but, rather, cautiously approaching love. The music slides along with a relationship to various genres that is curious and sincere while not making a firm commitment to any one, and with a depth and complexity that underlies the gentle waves on the surface.

And yet, they craft a sound uniquely their own.    Comprised of members from such notable projects as  Luna Li ,  Maylee Todd  and  Mimico , Mother Tongues are hardly fresh faces in the Canadian music scene. Since 2014, they've played regular gigs at concert venues and stages across both Canada and the U.S., performing and revising the very same tracks that now appear on their debut EP. They also serve as a prominent piece of a much larger puzzle that makes up a blossoming psychedelic music scene in Toronto.    If there's one word that best describes  Everything You Wanted , it's atmospheric. Sounding like a film score pitting the listener at its centre and enveloping them in walls of sound, the EP is hypnotic, mystical and nostalgic. There are fuzzy guitar riffs, dramatic keyboard arrangements and bumping bass lines — along with Charise Aragoza and Hannah Bussiere Kim's unclouded vocals — that quickly set a dreamy mood for the album.    On seven-minute opus ""Eternity,"" a steady, metronomic kraut tempo crashes against the rapid attacks of driving guitars, while ominous keys build on top of synth waves on the haunting and leisurely ""Heads Up."" Elsewhere, ""Let You Down"" starts off as a lively pop track before being overtaken with swirling, patterned melodies of the progressive rock variety. This twisting, morphing dynamic is a recurring fixture on the EP, with most songs suddenly shifting in unexpected but effortless ways.     Mother Tongues's  Everything You Wanted  EP may only be six songs but there's plenty of meat on the bones for listeners to sink their teeth into and enjoy, at least until the band drops a full-length LP. Fingers crossed that happens sooner rather than later.  ( Buzz )                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Mother Tongues",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/mother_tongues_everything_you_wanted_ep_album_review
2020-07-30,Adam Feibel,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Thanya Iyer Explores a World of Sounds with Dazzling Clarity on 'KIND',,"How can we do better? It's a question that's often asked, but not often enough. Humans don't tend to like it when a question lingers for too long; one way another, we are compelled to find an answer — whether it's the right one or not — or else just let it go. But some questions are meant to be asked over and over. You're meant to spend your whole life trying to answer them.     Thanya Iyer lingers on this question throughout  KIND , the Montreal auteur's second album. Fresh and inquisitive, it's a musical collage that reflects deeply and extensively on the things that make it hard to be human — self-esteem, depression, anxiety, grief, pain, bigotry, age, illness, disability — and works its way through a process of self-reflection, self-care and self-love. This journey plays out musically (and visually, thanks to a 20-minute mini-movie accompanying the album) in a way that's full of sonic abstraction and dazzling clarity.    It's not often that you hear music that is virtually genreless. Iyer's work is sculpted out of experimental art-pop, folk, jazz, soul, ambient, influences from across the globe and who knows what else. It could live comfortably in the loosely connected domain of other high-art types like  Moses Sumney ,  Stereolab  and Canada's own  Tara Kannangara , but really, it lives in a world entirely its own.    Iyer's approach is textural, abstract and often improvisational. With the firmly grounded rhythms of bassist Alexander Kasirer-Smibert and percussionist Daniel Gélinas, Iyer can follow her creative whims — which include the meticulous implementation of keyboards, strings, piano, brass trios, vocal sextets, flautists and harpists — without having to worry about getting lost in all the instrumentation. Refrains and rhythmic themes are often relegated to the background to let the auxiliary instrumentation run wild, but they're always there anchoring the compositions.    Yet even with all there is going on throughout  KIND , the songs leave lots of space to linger on a thought. Iyer does just that, picking out a particular lyric and repeating it over and over until it becomes a mantra. She chooses her words carefully, finding the essential source of a feeling. Amid the interstellar, otherworldly sounds of ""Alien,"" it contains only four lines: ""Bring me down to Earth / Teach me how to learn / Teach me how to live / Teach me how to love.""     Iyer's voice itself is soft and lilting, yet confident and controlled. It's also just as much of a tool for manipulation and experimentation as any instrument on  KIND . ""I ain't gonna run and hide,"" she proclaims on the dizzying ""My Mind Keeps Running,"" the knotty, multi-tracked vocal melodies ping-ponging around a room already filled with the shrieking of saxes. In the polyrhythmic haze of ""Let the Smoke Clear,"" she accentuates the off-beats word by word. ""No more will I hold on to you, so I let it go,"" she hums in ""Bring Back That Which Is Kind to You,"" her voice overlapping until it forms its own atmosphere.    These are not quite affirmations; they look for answers rather than providing them and seek peace and harmony rather than providing it. ""Please Don't Hold Me Hostage for Who I Am, for Who I Was"" is ultimately the clearest distillation of Iyer's vision and talent; it's a pleasant and carefree groove adorned with fluttering flutes and floating harmonies, yet with the ability to jarringly shift into a thumping, jazzy bridge section. It also acts as a summary of the album's main themes: ""Take it in your own hands / Make the choice to get better.""    It's an album about learning, but there's a lot that  KIND  can teach us. In order to do better, we must be better. In order to be better, we must be loving. We must be patient. We must be empathetic. We must be kind.

2020-07-30,Angela Morrison,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Phoebe Ryan Moves from Pop Songwriter to Rising Star with 'How It Used to Feel',,"Phoebe Ryan's debut LP,  How It Used to Feel , is an excellent showcase of the young singer's pop music expertise, skills she honed while working as a songwriter in LA after graduating from the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in 2013. Ryan has slowly been building a body of singles and EPs over the past five years while writing for artists such as Oh Honey, Zara Larsson, Melanie Martinez, and even queen  Britney Spears  (""Man on the Moon"").  How It Used to Feel  makes a good case for Ryan's talents as an emerging solo pop star.    At times, her previous work — the  Mine  EP in 2015, singles such as ""Chronic"" and ""Dollar Bill"" —bordered on generic, but Ryan has been on a roll since 2017's  James  EP, infusing her laid-back pop with uniquely crafted melodies and thoughtful lyrics.  How It Used to Feel  is cohesive and mature without sacrificing Ryan's characteristic youthful playfulness. She touches on serious topics such as sobriety (""Try It Sober"") and the difficulty of finding self-love (""See Myself""), but still acknowledges, and even celebrates, her adventurous side (""The Real Wild Ones"").     Much like her previous tourmate  Carly Rae Jepsen , Ryan's music and lyrics express a complete devotion to understanding and working through a multitude of emotions. Yet where Jepsen always seems to be singing from the vantage point of those magical moments of longing and electricity before a relationship begins, Ryan often finds herself in a space of heartbreak, looking back on what has just ended. The past tense of the album's title indicates this post-breakup temporality, yet also suggests fond remembrance, a grown-up perspective on past feelings and experiences. Ryan effortlessly traverses the ups and downs of processing a breakup, from the aching, pounding ""Ring"" to the chilled-out, synth heavy ""Fantasy,"" in which she affirms that she's ""doing alright as far as I can tell.""     Ryan is at her best when she leans into her idiosyncrasies, in songs such as ""Try It Sober,"" with its sudden tempo shift between folksy acoustic verses and booming, anthemic choruses, and the goofy psychedelic music video for ""Fantasy,"" shot from the perspective of her pet parakeet. Ryan is certainly tuned into current Top 40 conventions — big, sweeping electronic production, echoing, chanting vocals, lyrics about the intensity of love and intoxication — yet the songs never tip over into cliché, residing firmly within Ryan's unique pop sensibility.

In fact,  Liza Anne  proves on  Bad Vacation  that it can sound a lot like new wave, pop-rock and beachy ballads that all come together to create a sprightly summer depression album.  Bad Vacation  shows Anne going through a gloomy and arduous metamorphosis, but ultimately, one that purges the dark emotions inside and brings them out into the light for her to confront.    Anne's dreary and beat-up lyrics set to catchy pop-rock allow her to sit with her grief following her last project,  Fine but Dying , where she first began to share her struggles with mental health. The execution is fun but the emotions are hazy, which, along with a new wave spin, is a combo that might remind listeners of  Paramore 's  After Laughter . The end of a strenuous relationship and its aftermath further highlight Anne's inner turmoil, where she refers to said relationship as a ""Bad Vacation"" but still secretly hopes her love will finally work out on ""Change My Mind."" ""Devotion"" is a strident breakup anthem and declaration of self-love that oozes riot grrrl energy à la  Bikini Kill .    Anne's internal monologue of feeling like a burden or becoming easily overwhelmed on tracks such as ""I Shouldn't Ghost My Therapist,"" ""Bummer Days"" and ""Desire"" all have qualities that are both playful and riddled with ennui, again with a bright tone on the surface and a softer, more idle current underneath, capturing the spirit of feeling melancholy on a blinding sunny day. The album fittingly closes with ""Too Soon,"" where she expresses her desire to ""lose her mind a little"" in order to love again without being held back by her tendency to overthink. On  Bad Vacation , the emotions may be heavy, but that won't stop listeners from dancing along to them and air-guitaring in their bedrooms.

Glassio pulls from his own heartbreak while wrestling with self-acceptance, loneliness and life's sudden changes. You can see Glassio accepting his reality the deeper you delve into the LP, which plays out like a sweet coming-of-age story.    The contrast of Glassio's character in the beginning of the album and the end of the album really emphasises the idea that ignorance is bliss and the only way to heal is to look in the mirror and see exactly who you are.    ""I wanna change for the very last time of my life,"" he sings on mid-album cut ""Are You Having Fun Without Me?"" — obviously implying that Glassio has already made changes in his life and would prefer not to alter himself any further. Ignorance is bliss, right?    Fast-forward to the last track of the album: on ""Thunderbirds,"" Glassio has come to terms with himself and has accepted that perhaps he isn't yet the changed man he thought he was — the song ends with ""I'm gonna change for the very first time."" These two songs pair perfectly, tying together the themes of accepting one's shortcomings and moving on after personal loss.     For the Very Last Tim e is an impressive first record from Glassio. Utilizing dance influences as a vessel for intricate pop melodies, introspective lyrics and lush harmonies makes for a light, fun album that will really put you in your feels once you narrow in on the lyrics. It will be exciting to see what else Glassio brings to the table as he continues to develeop as an artist.

Old Flowers , which follows 2018's  May Your Kindness Remain , is a heart-wrenching dedication to heartbreak that lingers long after the last track has died out.    Though the theme hardly covers new ground, Andrews's ability to map the innermost corners of a broken heart is truly one of this year's most vulnerable and touching tributes to love. Featuring only two other musicians, Twain's Matthew Davidson and  Big Thief 's  James Krivchenia ,  Old Flowers  is a starkly minimal and pared-down project that lets Andrews's raw emotions and lyrics take centre stage.    From the crushing weight of opener ""Burlap String"" where she croons ""there's no replacing someone like you"" to the wistful acceptance of ""Ships in the Night"" that gently sends off her lover with hopes of better days ahead,  Old Flowers  charts the Phoenix-born singer's journey to find her footing once more. Steeped in the deeply personal turmoil of Andrews's loss, the album's strength lies in its ability to turn her experiences into broader truths of human experience. The existential line of questioning Andrews asks herself on ""Carnival Dream"" pulls at the universal heartstrings of anyone who has suffered the end of a loving relationship: ""Will I ever let love in again? / I may never let love in again."" It is uncomfortable to sit with, but Andrews has never been one to shy away from the tough questions.    Overwhelmingly elegiac and mournful in tone,  Old Flowers  is heartbreaking in and of itself. It is emotional, redemptive and leaves an indelible mark on the listener. Andrews provides a raw, honest and unflinching look in the mirror of a failed relationship and finds herself; it's a story as old as time, but somehow told more achingly beautiful here.

It always seemed to function more as an avenue for Dwyer to experiment outside of his more well-known band.    With  Bug on Yonkers , Dwyer continues his apparent disinterest in being accessible, as the album is a collection of nine cover songs from obscure psych/noise rock legend  Michael Yonkers . It's obvious that Dwyer and the band he put together on this record are purely making this music as a loving tribute, and not to sell copies or have a hit.     Bug on Yonkers  serves as a peek into the musical DNA that made Dwyer's music what it is. These covers wouldn't sound too out of place on any of his work with Oh Sees, but the performances are looser and more spontaneous: seemingly not out of a lack of effort, but out of respect and love for the original songwriter.    Songs like ""Lovely Gold"" and single ""I Tried"" plod at a healthy pace, as bass synthesizer grooves serve as a backbone for Dwyer (and Damaged Bug member Brigid Dawson) to sing Yonker's words amidst abrasive analog synth and guitar noise.    As a full-length release, it feels admittedly slight, especially in the wake of Oh Sees' 80-minute prog/psych/krautrock opus  Face Stabber  from last year, but it's engaging to hear Dwyer's commitment to making these songs as fun as possible.     Bug on Yonkers  is destined to go down as a minor release in Dwyer's prolific discography. Regardless, it's still a fun record, and one that showcases modern psych's leading frontman paying tribute to his idol in a way that should satisfy Michael Yonkers and general psych-rock fans alike.

2020-07-22,Sarah Chodos,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC",Nicolas Bougaïeff's Disorienting 'The Upward Spiral' Will Leave You Wondering Which Way Is Down,,"If a tree falls in a forest, does it make a sound? Or, more to the point, what if all that can be heard is the sound of trees falling to an impossibly complex rhythm, accompanied by the occasional wail of a chainsaw, but there was never a forest that anyone was aware of? The experience of listening to  Nicolas Bougaïeff 's latest work,  The Upward Spiral , is a bit like being on an amusement park ride that is moving through tunnels, enchanted forests, space stations, construction sites and busy city streets. The sound can change suddenly and dramatically within a song and the complexity of the rhythms gives a sense of discontinuity.    This is not music for meditation and relaxation. It is not even music to get comfortable to.    Bougaieff is from Quebec but is now based in Berlin. Both of these places have complex histories and and, not coincidentally, thriving electronic music scenes. Bougaieff brings influences from classical, rave and the avant-garde to his music.    There is very little melody on  The Upward Spiral ; the sounds are more like drilling, sawing or machines beeping than traditional instrumentation. Exceptions are ""Nexus"" (which would not be out of place in a soundtrack of a fantasy movie), ""Flying High"" (which is dreamy and surreal), and the final, cautious-sounding refrain on ""Listen Carefully to the Heart Beat."" Mostly, the album is composed of sounds that, while human-made, do not always sound like sounds humans would make intentionally — but rather as by-products of other things humans do, composed with the intentionality of someone influenced by Tchaikovsky.    The result is a kind of zombie-like presence of a musician who is anywhere and nowhere at the same time.

When the Sky Melted , the third album by the Calgary-based producer and artist, feels their most cinematic. Hello Moth has a way of singing that's dramatic but harmless, with the words clearly enunciated in a way that's like narrating a children's story.    There isn't anything innocent about the context of the songs though. In ""Inside,"" misery is mixed with energized emotion — a blend of synths and strings and crashing drumbeat. ""Wanted to Tell You"" is haunting and slow-moving, with a subtle build-up to a climatic ending. Lyrically, there's also a theme of isolation, notably in ""Times Like This,"" that alludes to either being by oneself or enclosed in a sense of unending routine with somebody else. These are songs that seem apt for times of lockdown and social distancing, when a sense of claustrophobic doom was suddenly thrust upon the world.    Similarly, other tracks seem to highlight the environment and being lost in the state of the world, references to nature integrated with personal insecurity. ""Gusts of water, floods of wind / Caress this world within a world in hiding / Gusts are all we feel / Unending things are barely real,"" Hello Moth sings on ""Canyons (Acoustic),"" an acoustic track with strings for added folkiness, while the lyrics of ""All Day All Night"" are the words of the title in a continuous loop, echoing and ringing like voices in your head.    ""Midnight News"" initially seems joyful, with lyrics that skip along with an accompanying beat. Then the chorus comes and a seriousness takes over again, conveying a desperation for wanting to find the truth when there's so much fiction blended in. In ""To Be Reached"" and ""Footprints,"" Gameboy sounds bleep and bloop along, a background playfulness to the darkened uncertainty that's layered on top.    ""Lucid Dream (Mothapella Mix)"" and ""Stereo"" perhaps sum up  When the Sky Melted  best. The former is mesmeric and melancholic while drawing upon the need for a dreaminess in times of darkness: ""There's a lucid dream to guide us along / To the clear of the night where we belong."" The latter is more danceable but wistful. ""Troubles will come and go / Life is a broken stereo,"" Hello Moth suggests, as the though the outside world can become distorted when stuck inside, and as though sounds are needed (musical and conversational) in order to get us through.

2020-07-23,John Amen,6,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Skullcrusher Lets Her Influences Show on Promising Debut EP,,"Skullcrusher 's eponymous debut EP spotlights Helen Ballentine's natural talent as a singer-songwriter, even though the four-song sequence often comes across as emulative, work that that may have benefited from a more thorough recasting of obvious influences.    The EP opens with ""Places/Plans,"" featuring a hook-y melody and mercurial vocals reminiscent of  Phoebe Bridgers ,  Snail Mail  and  Soccer Mommy , among others. The track captures a particular uncertainty, the palpable tension of having creative aspirations yet ""no plans for tomorrow."" Sonically, Ballentine's strummy acoustic guitar blends effectively with collaborator Noah Weinman's droning synth part, conjuring some of the austere soundscapes of early  Bright Eyes .    ""Trace"" shows Ballentine moving in a pop direction, bringing to mind  Waxahatchee 's  Ivy Tripp  or  Out in the Storm . An ebullient melody and slacker lyrics (""Wasting another day / Trying to ignore my face"") are complemented by Weinman's jangly banjo part, resulting in a lo-fi/alt-Americana vibe. ""Two Weeks in December,"" a promising but abruptly truncated sketch about meeting a stranger and waking ""alone in a frozen broken home,"" may strike some listeners as an angsty riff on  the Beatles ' ""Norwegian Wood.""    ""Day of Show,"" despite its allusion to the performative life, occurs as a portrait of someone struggling with depression or attempting to navigate isolation during the  COVID-19  era: ""I've been searching for an hour in my closet / Trying to figure out what to wear / For a day I'll spend alone in my room."" The instrumental segment toward the end of the song, replete with guitar, bass, drums, and synths, is notably well-textured.    Skullcrusher's debut points to Helen Ballentine's undeniable skills, particularly as a melodist. A bit more distancing from popular templates, however, may have served to further distinguish her work from that of her abovementioned contemporaries. Hopefully, subsequent releases will flesh out and affirm Ballentine's potential, offering the listener a more sustained and varied experience.

Their new band is a vehicle to explore their more primitive tendencies, now culminating in their self-titled debut.    Spirit Possession takes it back to the first wave of black metal, before metal had enough sub-genres to fill an encyclopedia, and when the iron of extreme metal was still hot. So, it should come as no surprise that this album owes much to the works of  Celtic Frost  and  Bathory , particularly on songs like ""Twin Tongued Pathways"" that have a more early thrash and speed metal vibe to them. The band do a good job of recreating the essential aesthetics of that sound, like the dull, thudding blast beats, the razor wire guitar tone and the eerie effect-laden vocals combining the shrieks of Quorthon and the visceral grunts of Tom G. Warrior.    There's also parts of this album that incorporate sounds from the second wave of black metal, such as the icy minor chords and darkly melodic lines of ""Amongst Inverted Castles and Holy Laughter"" and ""Eleven Mouths,"" sounds that are used sparingly and bring more breadth to the album. The band also adds harsh noise elements to their material, but it's only used as a non-sequitur into unrelated songs and never in a way that's interesting. There's also a heavy use of trills on the guitar, seemingly carried over from Ulthar, but they're so ubiquitous that the album can blur into one long hammer-on/pull-off sequence.    That's part of what holds this album back. While some interesting choices were made, the framework of this music is too rigid for experimentation, so the album seems to exhaust its ideas and by the end the songs become indistinguishable. It's a pitfall of revisiting a sound that's special partly because it exists in a certain time and place. To an extent, it's already been perfected by the bands who created it.

With production nods from  Burial  and  Jamie xx  and vocals echoing the tenderness of  Cigarettes After Sex  and  Rhye , the duo's sophomore record finds a nice meeting ground between hypnotic electronica and pulsing dance music. It's not a groundbreaking record, but Howling's feel for mesmerizing, textured dance music provides some quality moments across  Colure 's 13 tracks.    This texture comes in a number of different ways, the most notable of which includes the liberal use of acoustic instruments. The resounding piano chords on ""Dew"" provide a strong counterpoint to ambient, wordless vocals and synth work. Elsewhere, the stark pairing of piano and vocals on ""Lover"" makes for an effective combo, before the track takes the same chords and morphs into an extended dance cut.    Despite its not-so-groundbreaking premise, Wiedemann's production across  Colure  is impressive in the way that it finds new ways to surprise the listener. The record is a meticulously crafted fusion of yearning vocals and hypnotic electronics, with just the right blend of wistfulness and propulsive dance energy.

2020-07-23,Eva Zhu,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,PUNK,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Neck Deep's Lovestruck 'All Distortions Are Intentional' Is Their Catchiest Yet,,"Welsh quintet  Neck Deep  have been pop-punk heavyweights since the release of their debut album, 2014's  Wishful Thinking , amassing dedicated fans from around the world and going on countless tours. Their newest album  All Distortions Are Intentional , filled with 12 absolute jams, proves yet again why they're at the top of their game.    Unlike their previous three releases, the band decided to create a cohesive narrative this time around. The album starts with ""Sonderland,"" a drum-heavy song about a depressing town where citizens are addicted to conformity. The narrator, Jett, wants to find something better.    On ""Fall,"" arguably the song with the second-catchiest chorus (nothing can touch ""What Took You So Long""), Jett falls hard for a girl and realizes he's found ""a little slice of heaven"" with her. Then, on ""Lowlife,"" we learn that her name's Alice and that she's way out of his league. He drinks coffee on a trampoline while she's ""perfectly clean."" Jett hates everyone else and unironically calls them ""normies.""    The albums flow is broken by ""Quarry."" It's short, monotonous and borders on emo rap. The song takes listeners out of Jett's relationship with Alice and throws them into unfamiliar territory.    The sickeningly cute songs about love are back with ""What Took You So Long."" Other than having the catchiest chorus, it truly showcases just how confident lead singer Ben Barlow is in his relationship. While these songs are about Jett and Alice, the inspiration seems to comes from Barlow's real-life love for his girlfriend.    After almost an entire album full of love songs, the album ends with a reminder to live life how you want to, since we'll be ""Pushing Daisies"" anyways.    If you're a fan of pop-punk and romance, don't sleep on this album, because  All Distortions Are Intentional  might be Neck Deep's best work yet.

As a former member of Brandon, Manitoba, trio  the Middle Coast , Dylan MacDonald is no stranger to the road or the studio. Far removed from his old band's yacht-rock sound, MacDonald has a knack for simple, sticky melodies that stay with you long after  You Were 's five songs finish.    The type of immersive prairie songwriting of which MacDonald seems fond gives the songs a comfortable, familiar feel, even if it's the first time you are hearing them. It may be the unmistakable themes of love, heartbreak and the yearning for something that isn't there anymore that gives the EP its warmth.    Using simple, enduring melodies, subtle pedal steel, a compendious guitar sound, sure-handed, utilitarian drumming, restrained Wurlitzer keys and understated bass lines, MacDonald employs the less is more approach, without sounding like something is missing in the arrangement. If this EP is any indication, he is definitely on the right path with Field Guide.

2020-07-15,Owen Torrey,8,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Ambient Legend Laraaji Captures the Beautiful Naïveté of Childhood on 'Sun Piano',,"When people tell the story of ambient music pioneer  Laraaji , they usually start here: one day in 1978, as Laraaji was playing the zither in Washington Square Park, a man across the way heard him, strode over, and asked to make a record. The man was  Brian Eno ; the request was sincere. In 1980, the two collaborated on  Ambient 3: Day of Radiance , a work that established Laraaji's signature sound — brilliant strokes of trance-like strings that, according to Laraaji, free up the listener's attachment to time.    It's a tidy origin story, and a true one, yet it tunes into Laraaji's life frustratingly late. What of the years before Brian Eno, the earlier moments in the artist's development? On his latest work  Sun Piano , the 77-year-old multi-instrumentalist returns at last to the musical foundations of his young life. The result is a spacious collection of piano pieces, suffused with the sound of childhood — when every note was still a new one.    Laraaji — born Edward Larry Gordon — first came across the piano in the Baptist church where he spent his youth. On Sundays, things were quiet in the hours between Sunday school and church service. Laraaji had these moments to spend with the church piano, making of the silence what he wanted, filling it with sounds that were his. He'd imitate his favourite pianists —  Fats Domino , Errol Garner,  Oscar Peterson  — and watch his fingers stumble into the patterns these players had made. Before long, he started to produce patterns of his own.    These childhood memories closely inform how, decades later, Laraaji went about creating  Sun Piano . On the new album, the artist finally returns to his first instrument, as well as to a divine space like the one where he began to play. All recording sessions for  Sun Piano  took place in a huge Brooklyn church, with Laraaji improvising the instrumental sketches assembled on the release.    True to the form of ambient music,  Sun Piano  evokes a general atmosphere, rather than any particular melodic structure. And what an atmosphere it is: In Laraaji's able hands, the relatively well-mannered, polite instrument of the piano unburdens itself, emitting its own radiance into the quiet of the empty church.    It's an effect aided by producer Jeff Ziegler, known for his work with singer  Kurt Vile  and harpist  Mary Lattimore . Here, Ziegler's production is light, roomy and lucid. Laraaji's melodies expand to fill the contours of the church — sounding out the high walls and windows, catching the light as it streams in.    There are standout tracks to be found — the chiming circles of ""Lifting Me,"" the smooth peaks of ""Temple of New Light"" — but, mostly,  Sun Piano  is an extended meditation, best heard in full. There's both familiarity and surprise in the meandering course of its melodies: a fitting mix for a musical pioneer retracing the path he started on, while still charting ahead.

2020-07-15, Joseph Leroux,7,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK",Kllo Rekindle Their Synthpop Chemistry on 'Maybe We Could',,"The reception to  Kllo 's dance-inflected debut,  Backwater , in 2017 sent the Melbourne-based duo touring around the globe twice. But their next attempt would lead vocalist Chloe Kaul and producer Simon Lam towards burnout. Exasperated and without a record to show, the next two years saw the artists creatively independent from one another: Kae moved to Los Angeles, while Lam disappeared globetrotting or hustled at home. Both grew their solo careers, collaborated with other artists, and released new music. But there was no word on when, or if, Kllo would try again.    Their tightly wrought sophomore release,  Maybe We Could , is a brooding yet effervescent evidence of this trying-again. Kay's lyrics and breathy delivery hover between ambiguity and strong emotion while Lam's beats take up just enough space. Think sustained piano chords pursued by '90s rave drums and shorn vocal clips.    For sure, the elements at play here are not new for Kllo. Nevertheless you get a sense of growth within the artists two personalities: the balladeer in Kae presents a more sombre edge, while the sensitive dancefloor inclinations of Lam angle more readily towards a minimal hedonism.  Maybe We Could  benefits from this sparsity on the title track as well as on ""My Gemini,"" where staccato vocal ensemble samples and high-pass drums clips slap over grimy sub-bass. It's an interlude between more effusive cuts like ""Ironhand"" and lead single ""Still Here."" Groovier still, ""A Mirror"" kicks a four-on-the-floor feel away from verbal analysis and towards an instrumental insistency reminiscent of Ghostly International labelmate  Sheigeto .    Forever fans of the duo will find more of what they love here but in a new enough configuration to surprise. It's a release that somehow feels like it has less to prove from a duo not quite overdue for their follow-up to a huge success.

2020-07-15,Francesca Rose,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Ora Cogan's Haunted 'Bells in the Ruins' Hints at a Darkness Beneath the Surface,,"Some types of music instantly whisk you away in a stream of blissfulness, the instrumentation swirling and the vocals a hypnotic murmur.  Bells in the Ruins , the latest album by Victoria, BC-based artist  Ora Cogan , has moments of this. The opening track, ""Tell"", has rippling guitars and gliding high-pitched vocals, the airiness of being outside on a warm sunny day. Closing track ""Crime"" is similar in the way it's stretched out and laid back, conveying the mentality of getting lost in the moment. But these feel like a kind of front, a cover disguising the inner darkness.    The album, Cogan's fifth, focuses on loss and absence, and this is channelled primarily through the sonic atmosphere. In ""Kills,"" the gentle harmlessness of the beginning speeds up into a chaotic, repetitive cry of the word ""kills,"" suggesting losing one's mind while coming to terms with a distressing truth. ""Fixé"" and ""The Devil"" are eery and hollow, the loss being like a sense of loss of space and time. They contain the kind of crashes and wails that one may associate with falling into the pits of hell. ""Secret"" starts with intimacy and melancholy but opens up into a reflective warmth. It's like a window letting in the light, a tease before the contrast of ""Alta,"" which is slow and distant and wrapped in a nighttime darkness alive with ghosts and ghouls.    The aforementioned opener and closer are more in line with Cogan's  Shadowland  album from 2016, which transitioned her from her earlier folkier material into something more psychedelic, while the majority of the songs are an elevation of the dark and supernatural aura of 2017's  Crickets . Cogan's lyrics are hard to discern — her voice is used more as an instrument, whirling in pitch and pulling the listener along. Songs can blur into one with a consistency that makes it difficult to distinguish one song from the next.  Bells in the Ruins , however, is perhaps her most intense, with a contrast of warmth and spookiness that warns of the unsettling gloom that can lurk below the surface.

Take a Brassy Approach to Symphonic Metal on Socially-Minded 'We Are One',,"We Are One , the latest outing from teutonic metal legend Udo Dirkschneider, is less a  U.D.O.  album in the traditional sense and more of a musical collaboration with the official Concert Band of the German Armed Forces (Musikkorps der Bundeswehr). It's a unique approach to metal — even though it's being described as ""symphonic,"" there's no strings, which gives it a more bombastic, Wagnerian, and brassy feel, with trumpets screaming their high notes and heavy use of tubas to heighten epic soundscapes. Additionally, all the tracks were written in conjunction with official Musikkorps composers Guido Rennert and Alexander Reuber, making the collaboration feel seamless, with every part fully complementing the next.    Kicking off with the powerful ""Pandemonium"" , We Are One has a preachy lyrical style, with ""save the world"" anti-global warming tracks (""We Are One,"" ""Mother Earth""), songs about self-image in the age of social media, (""Neon Diamond""), and critiques of the atrocities refugees face (""Here We Go Again""). But if you push all that aside, Dirkschneider's trademark high-pitched growl is in fine form. He's more than just an ""old man yelling at a cloud"" — Udo is trying to tell us something. If you want to listen, it's up to you.    On the whole,  We Are One  is a distinctly unique offering in the world of metal. The wind ensemble's theatrics have a bit more swagger than a full orchestra would. They approach their arrangements in a more bluesy, jazzy, non-classical way, giving the record a punch that many standard symphonic metal bands are unable to accomplish. There's also some strange instrumental choices like bagpipes and saxophone solos, plus a track that features Dirkschneider trying his hand at rap in what is perhaps a odd tip of the cap to  KISS 's ""All Hell's Breakin' Loose."" The guitars also do their part with lots of crunchy riffs and screaming guitar solos, with Udo's son Sven keeping things in the pocket with his capable drumming.    At the end of the day,  We Are One  isn't a classic, but it does push boundaries musically, and it tries to do the same socially with its progressive lyrics. It's a bizarre record, but given the era that the former  Accept  screamer comes from, would you expect anything less? In a time when the whole world feels like one big car crash, it's hard to look away from the statement Dirkschneider is making on  We Are One .

Free I.H: This Is Not the One You've Been Waiting For  shows how making music can be cathartic for an artist, a way of letting out inner bubbling emotions and throwing up a middle finger up to frustrating situations now in the past. In the case of L.A's  Illuminati Hotties , this means fulfilling their contact with their label, Tiny Engines, after the company was accused of unjust business practice.    The overall mood of  Free I.H  feels very DIY. ""frequent letdown"" exudes pop-punk energy, with lyrics that are lighthearted but incredibly relatable for creatives: ""I am no CEO,"" band leader Sarah Tudzin states, before exclaiming in a joyful, sing-song manner in the chorus, ""I'm always letting everyone down / I'm always letting everyone know I'm down."" ""free dumb"" follows with a similar message, the opening lines questioning the relevance of a career in the arts: ""While the world burns up, could you care about a fucking record?"" The track is more reflective, but in a rapid, noisy way, where the electronics buzz and trail out at the end.    The project was all written and recorded during three weeks in February, then mixed in March. This seemingly spontaneous creation period, and the fact that the record is presented as a mixtape rather than an album, makes the range of sounds explored throughout feel natural. ""melatonezone"" has whiny vocals and a playful burst of energy in the chorus reminiscent of classic  Weezer , for example. ""WATTBL"" is straight-up angsty punk, while ""content//bedtime"" begins with crashing strums of guitar but continues with cheerleader chants and Tudzin ad-libbing things like ""very good"" and ""it's exhausting, ain't it?"" ""reasons 2 live"" is stripped-back and sentimental, but still retains the lyrical jokiness of the rest of the collection.    References to Tudzin's music industry complications are not explicit, but could be interpreted through the references to superficiality. It's the focus of ""frequent letdown"" and ""free dumb,"" and is also found in lyrics like, ""Everyone likes being around me / Everyone likes being around you more / Everyone likes following fashion / Everyone else likes everyone else much more"" (""content//bedtime""), and the acknowledging of independence and self-worth in ""b yr own b."" The single, ""will i get cancelled if i write a song called,  ' if you were a man you'd be so cancelled, '  is an unapologetic dig and, as the opener, sets a clear message for the overall mixtape.    All of this considered, the mixtape shows the fun that can be had with making a collection of songs — even when it's written to get out of a contract.  Free I.H: This Is Not The One You've Been Waiting For  is Illuminati Hotties defying the record industry while balancing purposefulness and playfulness at the same time.  (Tiny Engines)                           POP AND ROCK   PUNK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Illuminati Hotties",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/illuminati_hotties_free_i_h_this_is_not_the_one_youve_been_waiting_for_mixtape_album_review

Hate for Sale  represents a regrouping of sorts, seeing founding drummer Martin Chambers return to the studio, his first such involvement since  Loose Screw  in 2002, while Stephen Street, famed for his work with  the Smiths  and  Blur , also steps forward to lend his well-honed production expertise. Songwriting credits are shared between Hynde and guitarist James Walbourne — a partnership that administers a sharp boost of adrenaline to a sequence of wired three-minute numbers.    Straying away from the rustic roots-rock of the  Dan Auerbach -produced  Alone , the Anglo-American band's eleventh full-length outing draws much of its appeal from a subtle genre-shifting dynamic, a nimble rather than heavy-handed approach that is applied, at its most robust, on tracks such as the dub-drenched ""Lightning Man."" Despite the album's relatively brief runtime, it manages to pack enough punch in revisiting the elasticity of the Pretenders' essential sound — tacitly applying new sonic elements without appearing frivolous or affected in the process. This is cemented with Hynde's iconic contralto timbre, reverberating, as it does, with ever-present brooding allure, brought to the fore on ""I Didn't Know When to Stop"" and the melodic ""Maybe Love Is in NYC.""    As certifiable members of rock royalty, the Pretenders hit all the right notes with this latest entry to their expansive catalogue. Hynde teases at the borders of the expected, without disrupting the core formula that has contributed to the band's longevity — unwaveringly authentic as ever.

Each of the five songs delves into Troy's steps along the music path he has embarked on. He talks about adversity and the lack of support he's encountered.     ""People change for a little change / Life's too short to stress on little things,"" he raps on the opening lines of ""The Juice."" His songs are part affirmation and part exploration of past nuisances. But Junker would benefit from a deeper look into these aspects of his ascent. It would bolster the album by providing something more than surface level examples. He is relatable, but almost too much so. This could also be due to the too-short runtime — despite rap's current trends, the five songs aren't enough to truly dig into.     That's not to say Troy's music is not enjoyable or playable. There's just a need for story and emotion, because that is clearly the tone and approach he is taking. But Junker's life experiences beg for more exploration, including life as a miner, moving from a small Prairie town to Toronto for school, or being a part of the rising class of Indigenous rappers, all things on which he has a unique and likely interesting perspective.

Cue  Ultimate Success Today .     The reissue of the band's 2012 debut  No Passion All Technique  was occasion to recognize that, though they've certainly gotten better over their short but productive tenure, much of the post-punk you got from Protomartyr then isn't far from what you're likely to get today. Alex Leonard remains an architect of a drummer on  Ultimate Success Today , designing a unique but structurally sound beat for every track. Guitarist Greg Ahee is still a jack of all trades, alternating between massive chords (""Processed by the Boys""), spidery leads (""The Aphorist""), and caustic textures (""I Am You Now""). The heft that Scott Davidson brings to his bass playing is the reason his six-stringed counterpart can go on the sonic excursions he does, and Davidson still manages to pick his spots to shine, like on ""Michigan Hammers."" It's hard to complain that the bag of tricks hasn't changed much when the owner of the bag is one of the best rock bands around.  Ultimate Success Today  stands as an exceptionally thrilling rock record, even if it does little to push Protomartyr into unexplored territory.     On paper, the inclusion of saxophones, bass clarinet, flute and cello should make  Ultimate Success Today  expansive. In practice, the auxiliary musicians often add the sonic equivalent of extra seasoning to an already good dish; it's often unclear whether Protomartyr needs the addition. The bass clarinet under much of ""Processed by the Boys"" successfully contributes a sense of melancholy that might otherwise be lacking, but neither makes nor breaks the song. It's on ""Michigan Hammers"" that the orchestral elements do some real service, making an already transcendental chorus that much more so.    What really sets  Ultimate Success Today  apart from the band's previous records is much more subtle than a saxophone squeal. It's a sense of sentimentality that runs through some of the album's best tracks. ""June 21"" and ""Modern Business Hymns"" find the band sounding almost wistful and a little bit romantic. Much of this is to Casey's credit. Even when he's in the middle of a takedown, as on ""The Aphorist,"" Casey finds a way to stretch his voice in a more tender direction. It feels like a small yet immensely rewarding pivot for a band that has been so wonderfully vitriolic since their inception.

2020-07-22,Tom Beedham,8,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,MUSIC",Jessy Lanza Finds Intimacy from a Distance on 'All the Time',,"On the cover of her third album,  Jessy Lanza  reclines in the front seat of a minivan, one foot on the dash, her name and the album title scrawled across the top of the windshield in blocky but tasteful chalk marker capitals — a less cartoonish approximation of the way a new lease might look fresh off a dealer lot. It's magic hour, and the glow hits her face just right while long shadows cast across a virtually empty supermarket parking lot — lines she's not paying attention to, at least double-parked for the shot. And with eyes cast upward, presumably at the sky, there's a contemplative, uncertain expression creeping across Lanza's face.    In more ways than one,  All the Time  offers a snapshot of Lanza's pre-pandemic life. Dealing with the crushing weight of time and space from the most accelerated city in the continent, Lanza hashed the album out long-distance with her hometown Hamilton-based creative partner  Jeremy Greenspan  of  Junior Boys  while she was living in New York City, communication distorted by distance.    There's a vexxed and summery kind of sadness to these tracks, but Lanza and Greenspan are in their element feeling these feelings, cultivating a vibe that animates stillness as much as it calms unrest, production answering and accentuating Lanza's longing with sympathetic physicality. Album opener ""Anyone Around"" booms and claps along on an 808 simmer and spins out into breezy footwork sessions that sound like memories of parties past while Lanza calls out for contact. ""Like Fire"" is about getting burned, but the subdued, twinkling production makes it sting less. On ""Badly,"" the extended delay treatment on Lanza's vocals gives her words an instantly receding, foggy quality, as if she's questioning her own convictions the moment she's expressing them.    They're feelings that resonate even more intensely in a moment of physical distancing and sheltering in place — time Lanza has filled delivering DJ sets from her couch and performing hybrid sets from the trunk of her minivan when not creating video treatments for album singles. A recent offering —  a video for ""Anyone Around""  — dives into the video conferencing aesthetic, assembling guests including Greenspan,  Kara-Lis Coverdale  and  Korea Town Acid , reimagining the distance as an opportunity to connect digitally.    It's a record that exists on a wavelength somewhere between immersive and intangible, one that only seems accessible through the kind of perpetual spiralling Lanza describes between a shimmering synth and a 101 bass line on ""Lick in Heaven"": ""Once I'm spinning, I can't stop spinning.""    Lanza zooms between feelings and situations so nimbly that every time you revisit  All the Time  and the accompanying artwork, it's just as easy to imagine a freewheeling Lanza doing gleeful donuts in that parking lot as it is to envision her having a breakdown behind the wheel. To consider  All the Time  is to imagine a flat circle and the different ways you can fill it up. That proposition might feel overfamiliar for pandemic-era listeners, but Lanza navigates it with an angular propulsion and a commitment that diffuses the idle tension, almost normalizing it, making it more approachable.

2020-07-22,Mark Tremblay,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Acacia Strain Are Unafraid of Reinvention on 'Slow Decay',,"Only a year after previous album  It Comes in Waves ,  the Acacia Strain  return with their newest offering,  Slow Decay . Pushing further into sludge and doom territory,  Slow Decay  is their most musically atmospheric record to date. With just enough variety to avoid stagnation, Slow Decay sees the band further its maturation into a more sophisticated realm of heavy music.    Following in the experimental footsteps of  It Comes in Waves ,  Slow Decay  further leans into its sludge metal tendencies. ""Feed a Pigeon, Breed a Rat"", ""Birds of Paradise, Birds of Prey"" feel more at home on a mid-2000s sludge record than in the Acacia Strain's catalogue. There are plenty of death metal and hardcore sprinkled throughout on tracks like ""Chhinnamasta"" and ""One Thousand Painful Stings"" that will appease those who look at this band through a nostalgic lens. The inclusion of guest vocalists like  Jesus Piece 's Aaron Heard and  Mortality Rate 's Jess Nyx adds much needed dynamic range throughout.    The Acacia Strain are not reinventing themselves, nor doing anything unheard of, but are evolving graciously. For listeners who have stayed away from bands miscast under the guise of deathcore,  Slow Decay  is a pleasant surprise that shows a veteran band unafraid of reinventing themselves.

2020-07-22,Safiya Hopfe,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Lianne La Havas Fully Comes into Her Own on Self-Titled Album,,"British singer-songwriter  Lianne La Havas  has returned with her first album since 2015, a 10-track journey through romance and reverie. Tender, transparent, and uniquely hers — it is self-titled, and her first fully self-produced record — it is La Havas showing up as she is.  Lianne La Havas  is boldly authentic and infused with passion.    The album glistens with grace from the get-go. ""Bittersweet"" starts slow only to soar, while ""Paper Thin"" cracks to let the light in. Minimalist instrumentals serve as a sparkling backdrop for La Havas's voice, which oscillates gratefully between trembling vulnerability and anthemic belts. Surrounded by delicate rhythms, La Havas's distinct vocal range is spotlighted on this record like never before. It is then no surprise that she pulls off a cover of  Radiohead 's ""Weird Fishes"" with such grace, as her voice steeps the decade-old song in soul that sparkles.    La Havas's third full-length record is fluid with feeling, and evidence that she has fully come into her own.  Lianne La Havas  is a masterpiece of vulnerability charting the path of a heart in the throes of new love.
