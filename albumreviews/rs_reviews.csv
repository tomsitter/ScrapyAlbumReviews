2019-09-03,null,-1,,null,"The   has purchased more than $10 million of   stock, and let another $30 million worth of options expire, as the sports data giant’s stock price sags below its IPO levels. As part of the  ’s 10-year data and streaming deal with Sportradar signed last July, the league received three different buckets of equity options, in total worth about 1.8% of the company. The league has made decisions on two of those options, according to a recent Sportradar (Nasdaq:  ) regulatory  . In October, the NHL bought 1,116,540 million Sportradar shares at a strike price of $8.96, which gives it about 0.4% of the company. The league also had the option to purchase another $30 million worth of shares at the IPO price ($27), which it declined to do. That option has now expired, according to the filing.   The NHL still has a third equity option—a warrant to purchase another 1,353,740 shares at a price of $23.45. Sportradar opened Tuesday at $16.03. The league can wait for the shares to rebound; the warrants are good for 10 years. A representative for the NHL didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Official data feeds have become one of the most direct ways for leagues to profit off the expansion of   in the U.S., and these long-term exclusive partnerships are among the biggest non-broadcast deals in the market. Companies like Sportradar act as middlemen, recording data and packaging it into products purchased by media companies and sportsbooks. Sportradar’s portfolio includes various rights across the NBA, NHL, MLB, UEFA and a number of other global leagues and governing bodies. To sweeten the pot—and to secure business—data providers often include equity options for their most prominent partners. When Genius Sports inked a long-term exclusive deal with the NFL, for example, it included   in equity. The NBA’s deal with Sportradar also has an equity component, with options to buy   of the company. These equity-heavy deals are often frowned upon by investors, who worry that data companies will be unable to monetize the stats in a way that makes the deals profitable. Costs for data and IP usage by sports books has increased by four-fold thanks to such exclusive deals, which suggests that pricey exclusive data rights   if sportsbooks balk at higher prices. The argument appears to be behind the slumping stock prices of sports-data companies. After debuting at $27 a share with the IPO in September, Sportradar stock has slipped to $15 on broad market fears of sports betting’s profitability in light of data rights costs and taxes. Other stocks with exposure to sports betting have similarly suffered declines over the same period. “The U.S. betting market is still in its early innings,” Sportradar Chief Commercial Officer Eduard Blonk said in an email. “Our significant investments have helped us develop a strong market position and make the U.S. business our fastest growing region with 108 percent growth year-over-year, despite only accounting for less than 15% of Sportradar Group’s revenues. Globally, Sportradar has a well-established business that is  growing and highly profitable.”   Even with growth ahead for business, it’s a sign of how leagues can strike good deals today for their data – despite Sportradar’s 40% share decline the past six months, the NHL still sits on a 67% profit for its shares."

2022-03-25,Brenna Ehrlich,3.5,"Dan Bejar,Destroyer",Destroyer Take Us to a Demented Disco on ‘Labyrinthitis’,"’s last album,  , was recorded mostly at  ’s kitchen table — whispered phantasmagorias woven after his family was asleep. Bejar’s latest,  , is an apt insomniac’s companion as well — but this time it’s for lonely dancers who linger on the floor until the sun comes up, high on adrenaline… or something else. The Vancouver singer-songwriter has spent his career happily swerving between sounds and moods, from the Bowie-esque (2001’s  ) to the meta-yacht (2011’s  ) to the acerbic Springsteenian (2015’s  ). And from the first ecstatic strains of “Have We Met,” you get the sense that Bejar is still ardently dodging categorization. Here more than ever, he just seems game to throw everything against the proverbial wall and see what sound it makes. There are synths that recall Eighties videogames — or, perhaps, horny comedies like 1985 classic   — the silliness tamped down by Bejar’s deep velvet voice and less-than-sunny outlook. Take “Suffer,” for example, which despite rave-worthy beats (and robot voices!) reminds us, “No matter when/don’t matter where/you’re gonna suffer.” Could be your feet, weary from dancing, or your psyche — by that point you’re too far gone to care.   Once you hit “June” — a layer of sleaze caked over what devolves into a slam poetry event on the back of a junk truck — the night is full going off the rails. “Tintoretto, It’s for You” kicks off with atonal piano and Bejar’s sinister sneer leading into what can only be described as what it would sound like if Nick Cave was hanging at a disco club with light-up floors. There’s a brief respite from the flashing lights and slinking alleyways of the title track — a sound collage of children’s voices and the tread of feet on a woodland path — before manic drums usher us into the swinging “Eat the Wine, Drink the Break.” Then there’s “It Takes a Thief,” a jazzy, hyperactive track that leaves you clapping your hands right before the collapse — a.k.a. the woozy “The States” and the appropriately titled “The Last Song.” The latter is a kind of coda. Bejar is no longer whispering in the midnight kitchen or raging in the nightclub of his memories. It’s fully day now — or as day-like as a day can be in Destroyer World."

2022-03-28,Charles Aaron,2.5,"album review,Machine Gun Kelly",Machine Gun Kelly’s ‘Mainstream Sellout’ is a Self-Hating Celebrity Pop-Punk Purge,"Released last summer to tease  ’s sixth album, the single “Papercuts,” with its strummy Cobain-pain guitar and brain-stewing power chords, was met with a mild shrug of support. According to the proverbial “people on the Internet,” it was seen as another lateral “rock” move from the ex-mixtape rapper signed by Diddy in 2011 as a much-belated retort to Dr. Dre’s Eminem gambit. Although his 2020 pop-punk bid   (helmed by Kardashian-adjacent Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker) debuted at No. 1, there were still digs at MGK’s authenticity. So, who’s to know when Kelly wrote the furious rap that’s now been added to the “album edit” of “Papercuts.” But it’s clear his mind is aswirl with such perceptions as he barks: “Y’all said I switched genres/I saw the limit and took it farther/I’m a genius, could’ve made  /But this song is to my dead father,  .”   This is exactly the defiant, ego-flaunting sneer that has turned Colson Baker, damaged child of itinerant Christian-missionary parents, into the inked and bleached “Machine Gun Kelly,” a feuding, celebrity-coupling cutie chameleon who careens from stage to gossip site to lawsuit. Like Pete Davidson — who giggles through a cameo on   — he sparks reactions that blaze up into money.   Take the gleefully derivative “Emo Girl,” which cross-references multiple pop-culture niches and has already inspired a “Butt Rock Girl” parody. Boosted by live-wire foil Willow, a.k.a., Will Smith’s daughter, “Emo Girl” opens with a clip of the 2009 horror comedy   (current subversive feminist/queer touchstone), in which the title character, played by Megan Fox (Kelly’s current paramour), plainly states, “I am a god.” (Is this another troll by the weed bud of Ye’s ex-wife’s boyfriend?) The song seamlessly blends Avril Lavigne’s “Sk8ter Boi” with Good Charlotte’s “Riot Girl” and when Kelly reins in his yelpy tiks, the buzzsaw-bubblegum sticks. But such mirth and mayhem are not  ‘s goal. Assisted by Barker, his drummer/spirit guide, Kelly makes an evolving, not-very-joyful noise that nods to his old noise and inspires him to purge. The resulting sentiment:  . Song after song refers to dying, suicide, imagining himself or someone else dead, or viewing love as a zombie apocalypse. Lyrically, it’s his lingua franca. On opener “Born With Horns,” over a double-time breakbeat and slashes of guitar, he rap-moans “I don’t want to live anymore” and concludes on the more endearing, less snotty chorus, “In this film, I know there’s no happy endings.” He repeats that line in album closer “Twin Flame,” his attempt at a “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” with acoustic guitar and piano. On “Twin Flame,” as elsewhere, he’s broken and she’s too good, too pure, too magic for him, so it’s time to check out. Kelly, at age 31, hasn’t realized that introspective songwriting doesn’t stop at admitting you’re a narcissistic piece of garbage. The title track — not quite two minutes of alt-Nineties chum — has an Auto-Tuned MGK crooning and wailing insults hurled by others. (A vocal-fried Megan Fox pops up, asking, “Does he even, like, play guitar?”) But the song sputters out and it’s on to “Make Up Sex,” where he boasts, “Face down, laid pipe/Waterworks, swam in your pool.” All together now, “YECCHH!” For the most part, Kelly uses rock to express his pain and rap to escape from it, i.e., abusing substances with Lil Wayne on two fairly pointless tracks. He has a nice rapport with Iann Dior on the pleasant pop-rock exercise “Fake Love Don’t Last.” But whether Kelly deploys “rock,” “rap,” or “pop,” selling out and annoying people online are the least of his issues. Maybe next time, his self-loathing death wishes could be the jumping-off point, not the be-all, end-all."

2022-04-05,Mosi Reeves,2.5,,J. Cole Surveys His Empire on the Low-Stakes Mixtape ‘D-Day’,"Earlier this year, a debate briefly flared on social media: where have the superstars gone? What happened to the days when Kendrick Lamar and Drake battled for global supremacy, Kanye West elicited praise from the likes of David Lynch, the Future Hive controlled rap Twitter, Lil Wayne was the best rapper alive, and Nicki Minaj commanded the Hot 100? With those “stadium status” acts largely past their imperial phases – perhaps the jury is out on Pulitzer Kenny, who has yet to issue a follow up to his 2017 album   – the genre seems irrevocably atomized. Tyler, the Creator tours arenas without a radio hit. Cardi B earns millions while only releasing a song or two a year. Still, even new-gen rappers like Lil Durk who equate doing numbers with millions of streams instead of iTunes and CD sales know that  , no matter how elusive it may be. It’s why J Cole, a man who often gets treated like the Andy Murray of arena rap, spends the final track of  reasserting his superiority. “Some people think I’m runnin’ in third, they threw the bronze at me/Behind Drake and (K) Dot, yeah them niggas is superstars to me,” he raps on “Heavens EP.” Cole admits he can seem awkward and distant, “keepin’ my kids away from the gaze of the public.” He’s made a career out of these conflicted feelings, delivering albums that teeter between disarming introspection and trad rap boasts, evoking the days of “O’Shea aiming a gun at your brain” without the rhetorical confidence Ice Cube wielded so freely. “I piss in the celebrity tea,” Cole claims…except when he needs appreciation like everyone else.   “Heavens EP” is the most insightful track on  , which was released in conjunction with the 2022 edition of the Dreamville Festival in Raleigh, North Carolina. The rest feels entertainingly low stakes. It kicks off “Stick,” an impressively charged cipher between Cole, J.I.D., Kenny Mason, and Sheck Wes. The horn fanfare is reminiscent of Cole’s “Middle Child” from the previous Dreamville comp, 2019’s  . “Hand on my dick and hand on my gun/One is for shooting off and one is for fun,” J.I.D. rhymes. Meanwhile, DJ Drama sprinkles the track with automatic machine-gun fire, then lathers the first half of the tape with outrageously aggressive ad-libs. He uses Lute, Cozz and Omen’s “Starting 5” to crack wise about Will Smith’s Oscar slap. “Keep playing with Dreamville’s name. Don’t get Chris Rock’ed out your socks!” Drama bellows. As for the rest, pick your pleasures. Ari Lennox sounds off on a bad boyfriend for the saucy “Coming Down,” then offers some icky sexual metaphors on “Blackberry Sap.” Earthgang and 2 Chainz join forces, leading to the disappointingly muted “Ghetto Gods Freestyle.” Cozz flows with palpable hunger on “Big Trouble Freestyle,” which is set to the beat from the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Who Shot Ya.” As a prospect who hasn’t quite made an impact yet, Cozz sounds eager to make the most of  ; that same workmanlike energy enlivens “Starting 5.” But in the end,  is more content for the Dreamville metaverse, the kind of project on which empires are sustained but not won."
