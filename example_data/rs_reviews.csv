2022-03-22,Jason Newman,4,,Phife Dawg’s Posthumous Album ‘Forever’ Is a Beautiful Tribute to a Hip-Hop Legend,"Any posthumous album is, by its nature, haunting  —  the sound of ghosts on wax forever  floating in a state between unfinished project and final-ever recordings. But in the case of Phife Dawg, who died in 2016 at t he age of 45 from diabetes complications, that purgatorial sense feels particularly cruel. At the time of his death, the rapper born Malik Taylor had reunited — albeit tenuously —  with New York hip-hop icons A Tribe Called Quest. That reunion led to Tribe’s final album, the excellent  We Got It From Here …   Thank You 4 Your Service,  released in late 2016, eight  months after Phife’s death.  Listening to  We Got It From Here,  it is obvious Phife Dawg still had plenty to give. In fact, the celebrated rapper  had spent his final decade molding a treasure trove of unreleased rhymes into what he hoped would be a follow-up to  his only solo album, 2000’s  Ventilation: Da LP . It was never completed, but his family —  alongside business and musical collaborator Dion Liverpool — has finally finished the job with  Forever , which arrives  six years to the day he died. Unlike other posthumous albums, in which estates and family members use guesswork and vague  guideposts to determine what the artist wanted, in this case Phife left, as Liverpool noted in a recent interview, “a lot  of blueprints and clues.” Detailed notebooks included not just lyrics and song ideas but names of  producers and guest stars and other specific details. Liverpool estimated two-thirds of the album was  either finished or near fleshed out before he even stepped in.   Forever ,  which boasts appearances by Phife’s ATCQ partner Q-Tip, as well as  Busta Rhymes, Redman, Rapsody, and De la Soul’s Maseo, and  production by 9 th  Wonder and Nottz,  exists in an alternate hip-hop universe where the  genre stopped after the Soulquarians broke up in the early 2000s. The spirit of Phife’s friend and collaborator J Dilla  looms almost as large as Phife himself; the late hip-hop visionary, who died in 2006, produced  the lyrically dexterous “Nutshell, Pt. 2,” and Dilla acolytes are on hand emulating his vibe (see the  Potatohead People-produced “French Kiss Trois,” featuring Dilla’s brother Illa J). On the chilling “Dear  Dilla,” Phife eulogizes J Dilla on the verse, while Q-Tip uses the chorus to do the same to Phife.  Phife Dawg was always, among many other things, an unapologetic golden-age nostalgist, and on  Forever  he can often be heard reminiscing  on what he considered hip-hop’s glory days. “Wow Factor” shouts out pioneers like  Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, and Boogie Down Productions. “I’m that Seventies baby,” he rhymes. “Reppin’  hip-hop for the Nineties.” But it’s his calls to the future that end up being the most inadvertently heartfelt.  “Can’t wait to help my unborn read they first book,” he rhymes on “Fallback.” “Or daddy’s little girl  asking, ‘Daddy, what’s a hook?'” Forever  can be an emotionally brutal listen. Opener “Cheryl’s Big Son” features  a poignant cassette recording of Phife as a child, while a spoken-word poem from his mother  Cheryl Boyce-Taylor anchors “Round Irving High School” (“Phife was the bluеs, hip-hop, and hot jazz,”  she sings). But it’s album closer   “Forever” that will perpetually stand out as a gut-punch for fans of the  nimble rapper. Phife recorded the verse just three days before his death, running through his history with A Tribe Called Quest — “four brothers with the mic and a dream” — and eschewing their fractious past in favor of an olive branch: “I love you muhfuckers, true spit, all facts/Deep in my soul, I believe what will be shall be/Requiem for a Tribe.”   For anyone who watched the group’s  Beats, Rhymes and Life   documentary with a deep pang of regret and sadness, it’s both hard and  admirable to hear lines from “Forever,” like “If I could do it all over again/I’d sit down with my friend/ Was zero reason why this shit had to end.” In  Forever ,  we hear both a middle-aged man looking back on  his successes and failures both personally and professionally, and an artist unknowingly confronting  mortality and trying to make peace at the end.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/phife-dawg-forever-1323565/
2022-03-24,Mankaprr Conteh,4,,Koffee Reinvigorates Reggae for a Pop Audience on ‘Gifted’,"Koffee has only had about a dozen of her songs widely available to stream until now, but the 22-year-old Jamaican artist is already proving she can reinvigorate reggae and dancehall for a pop audience. Her joyous 2018 smash “Toast” earned her spots on two of Barack Obama’s coveted playlists, and in 2019 she became the first woman to win the Grammy for Best Reggae Album. Along the way, she’s collaborated with rapper Gunna and John Legend, and this year she’ll open the Latin American leg of Harry Styles’ world tour. Now, she’s delivering on the promise of “Toast” with  Gifted,  her excellent debut full-length.  On  Gifted,  Koffee combines traditional reggae with modern flourishes and hip-hop sensibilities, reminding us that rap’s roots are richly intertwined with Jamaican music. While a song like “Lonely” could make the purest purist smile, “Defend” breaks out dusty boom-bap production, and “Shine” sets sunny guitars over tittering hi-hats and strong 808s. The album’s musical backdrops range from breezy to absorbing, but it’s Koffee’s performances that are consistently bewitching. She skips between honeyed, heartfelt trills and mind-bogglingly meticulous flows, intricate and acrobatic. Even on the gentle “Lonely,” Koffee can’t help but break into dexterous bars about her vision, style, and inspirations for a fiery denouement.   “Lonely” is one of a handful of tracks here that could be classified as a love song, something that, so far, has mostly been absent from her catalog. Koffee usually puts pen to paper to empower and give thanks, but the girl proves herself to be a compelling romantic, too. When she coaxes and compliments her “darling” (her pet name of choice; she doesn’t employ any gendered pronouns) on “Lonely,” her game is so sweet and soft it almost feels platonic: “I hope your day’s fine — we should spend the day now.” She’s bolder on the standout “Run Away,” where her flashy flexes amount to pleas for affection: “I just wanna love somebody,” she admits.  More than anything, though,  Gifted  is a portrait of a brilliant young artist keenly aware of the miracles that lift her up: a loving mother, a benevolent maker, a tight community, and an impeccable sense of rhythm and rhyme. “Pull Up,” a winning meetup with the producer and Afroswing maven JAE5, is one of the album’s liveliest celebrations of life and love, elevated by a swirling sax line that winds around Koffee’s jubilant closing hook. You can picture her bright, braced smile when she coos about the simple pleasure of being outside on album opener “x10,” and again on “West Indies,” when she reminds her managers that even if she’s a prodigy, she also wants to party like any other kid. Even when Koffee engages with hardship in her hometown — she name-checks crime, inflation, and police brutality — she does so with brevity and optimism. Koffee is not blind to misfortune. She’s looking up in spite of it.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/review-koffee-gifted-1325218/
2022-03-24,Gary Suarez,4,,Daddy Yankee Retires in Style With ‘Legendaddy’,"Legacy artists need exit strategies. These days, with pandemic disruptions closing off lucrative live-performance opportunities, a lot of the biggest names in rock and pop history have taken headline-grabbing catalog buyouts of their sizable discographies for eight- to nine-figure sums. But departing the entertainment industry isn’t solely about cashing out; it’s also about leaving one’s fans on the best possible terms, ensuring that those who supported you all those years aren’t left unsatisfied. So over this past weekend, when Daddy Yankee formally announced his retirement from music, it made sense that the statement was tied to a new, and apparently final, album release.  Only the Puerto Rican superstar himself could get away with naming his farewell full-length with a portmanteau as cocksure as  Legendaddy ,  a title fittingly in line with his perception of himself (with respect to Don Omar) as the King of Reggaeton. Following ring announcer extraordinaire Michael Buffer’s fulsome introduction, opening track “Campeón” bursts with braggadocio, with Daddy Yankee describing himself as both boss and legend alike, the logical conclusion to a self-penned narrative some two decades old.   Barrio Fino  and its incendiary single “Gasolina” made Yankee the face of reggaeton in 2004, and, somewhat counterfactually, its de facto originator. Though his genre tenure precedes that moment, going back to the days of DJ Playero mixtapes 10 years prior, his success didn’t just popularize the sound, but also nudged it toward the legitimacy it enjoys today. Unfortunately, countless others who built this culture with and around him burned out or faded away, vestigially respected by those in-the-know for their contributions, but left far from the elite international class he’s operated firmly within up until now. Generationally, he remains effectively peerless, a once-uncertain outcome considering some of the well-intentioned yet deeply dated missteps present on some of his albums.  This, of course, comes as a product of Yankee’s contemporary evolution into a full-fledged pop star, one properly crystallized by 2017’s massive and ubiquitous “Despacito” after years of working around his streetwise breakthrough. Well-timed with the rise of reggaeton’s wider global pop success around the likes of J Balvin and Ozuna, the sheer accessibility and commercial plundering found on later singles like the Snow interpolation “Con Calma” and “Que Tire Pa Lante” seemed to finally slough off the last of his bad-boy image. Despite his late-period penchant for borrowing from other artists’ universally recognizable hits to build his own, the only truly overt application of this method on  Legendaddy  comes on “Pasatiempo,” a thumping collab with the like-minded Myke Towers, where producers Play N Skillz cheekily replay the melody of Robyn S’s “Show Me Love.” A big part of why  Legendaddy  proves to be his best album since  Barrio Fino  is its tacit rejection of nostalgia as his primary strength. Tracks like “La Ola” and the trap banger “Enchuletiao” feel fundamentally contemporary, reminding us that he’s been part of the current Latin music movement in a material way. Also effective are “El Abusador Del Abusador” and “Rumbatón,” which respectively add a tropical flair to the mix, thereby leaning into the island rhythms that preceded his chosen genre.  Yankee’s choice of vocal collaborators further supports this forward-looking approach, pulling largely from a comparatively younger crop of identifiable names, including Rauw Alejandro, Becky G, and Natti Natasha. As an early supporter of Bad Bunny, going back to their 2017 joint single “Vuelve,” El Conejo Malo returns that kindness sevenfold on the storming standout “X ÚLTIMA VEZ.” Similarly, Sech brings his R&B vibes to “Papra Siempre,” continuing a momentous run of collabs that include the joint hit “Definitivamente” and the Panamanian singer’s “Sal Y Perrea” remix.   That said,  Legendaddy  has its flaws, largely reflecting Yankee’s history of making iffy decisions that lead to uneven albums. On “Bombón,” he blunts the presence of Dominican dembow demigod El Alfa by letting Lil Jon vomit his ancient ad-libs over the proceedings, which in turn reduces the track to something from a Miami hotel pool party in 2012. Less cringeworthy, though still a challenging listen, is “Hot,” a Pitbull partnership that skews a bit too close to the stagnant Mr. Worldwide brand. Even so, Yankee can afford to take such risks here, faring better in grappling with his legacy than most in his position likely would. Ultimately,  Legendaddy  is not some victory lap marked by safe choices, but instead the sound of a Latin icon ending things on his own terms.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/daddy-yankee-legendaddy-1325228/
2022-03-25,Brenna Ehrlich,3.5,"Dan Bejar,Destroyer",Destroyer Take Us to a Demented Disco on ‘Labyrinthitis’,"Destroyer ’s last album,  2020’s  Have We Met , was recorded mostly at  Dan Bejar ’s kitchen table — whispered phantasmagorias woven after his family was asleep. Bejar’s latest,  Labyrinthitis , is an apt insomniac’s companion as well — but this time it’s for lonely dancers who linger on the floor until the sun comes up, high on adrenaline… or something else. The Vancouver singer-songwriter has spent his career happily swerving between sounds and moods, from the Bowie-esque (2001’s  Streethawk: A Seduction ) to the meta-yacht (2011’s  Kaputt ) to the acerbic Springsteenian (2015’s  Poison Season ). And from the first ecstatic strains of “Have We Met,” you get the sense that Bejar is still ardently dodging categorization. Here more than ever, he just seems game to throw everything against the proverbial wall and see what sound it makes. There are synths that recall Eighties videogames — or, perhaps, horny comedies like 1985 classic  Weird Science  — the silliness tamped down by Bejar’s deep velvet voice and less-than-sunny outlook. Take “Suffer,” for example, which despite rave-worthy beats (and robot voices!) reminds us, “No matter when/don’t matter where/you’re gonna suffer.” Could be your feet, weary from dancing, or your psyche — by that point you’re too far gone to care.   Once you hit “June” — a layer of sleaze caked over what devolves into a slam poetry event on the back of a junk truck — the night is full going off the rails. “Tintoretto, It’s for You” kicks off with atonal piano and Bejar’s sinister sneer leading into what can only be described as what it would sound like if Nick Cave was hanging at a disco club with light-up floors. There’s a brief respite from the flashing lights and slinking alleyways of the title track — a sound collage of children’s voices and the tread of feet on a woodland path — before manic drums usher us into the swinging “Eat the Wine, Drink the Break.” Then there’s “It Takes a Thief,” a jazzy, hyperactive track that leaves you clapping your hands right before the collapse — a.k.a. the woozy “The States” and the appropriately titled “The Last Song.” The latter is a kind of coda. Bejar is no longer whispering in the midnight kitchen or raging in the nightclub of his memories. It’s fully day now — or as day-like as a day can be in Destroyer World.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/destroyer-labyrinthitis-review-1326420/
2022-03-25,Kat Bouza,3.5,Camp Cope,Camp Cope Find Power In Vulnerability on ‘Running With the Hurricane’,"After several years of cutting their teeth in Melbourne’s underground scene,  Camp Cope  gained widespread attention outside their native Australia with the release of 2018’s  How to Socialise & Make Friends . Simultaneously brash and sincere, the album tackled heavy topics — misogyny in the music industry, sexual assault, the death of a loved one — with an unrelenting aplomb, making Camp Cope one of the most hyped indie-punk outfits of the late 2010s. Yet on  Running With the Hurricane , which arrives four years after the group’s breakthrough effort, the trio of Georgia Maq, Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich and Sarah Thompson have swapped punk fury for folky romanticism, channeling the brutal honesty that first endeared the band to audiences into an emotionally intimate collection of tender-hearted indie rock. The album — which borrows its name from a song written by Maq’s late father, Australian musician Hugh McDonald — finds the group embracing a gentler, more introspective approach, triggered partially by the effects of self-isolation brought on by the pandemic. To run with the hurricane is to not be consumed by chaos, but to acknowledge its transformative power, approaching the turbulence of life — heartbreak, failed expectations, insecurity — not as something to be feared, but rather something to be faced head-on with wild abandon. “I’m climbing out, I can feel the air/I feel it like it’s always been there,” Maq sings on the standout title track. “It says, ‘The only way out is up’/I can stretch my legs and run/I’m taking my place, running with the hurricane.”   These themes of growth and reclamation weave throughout the album, centered around a loose narrative that, unlike most heartbreak records, embraces the bittersweet aftermath of love lost. Here, there is beauty in pain, strength in failure. Instead of rage and regret, Maq pines for empathy and absolution (“Sing Your Heart Out”). Fleeting romances aren’t agonized over, but memorialized in tiny, joyous elegies delivered with the self-assured perspective that only comes with the passage of time (“Say the Line”). Recurrent imagery of fire, hurricanes, chains serve as stand-ins for psychological torment meant to be conquered. At times,  Running With the Hurricane  is almost uncomfortable in its familiarity, as Maq’s deliberately vague and often incomplete lyrics play out like snippets of secrets muttered to oneself in moments of seclusion. But, it’s this intimacy that, at its strongest points, allows the album to command attention even during the most humble, exposed moments — the musical version of speaking softly while carrying a big stick. Brief glimpses of the scrappy vocals exhibited on Camp Cope’s previous albums appear throughout the record — the jubilation in Maq’s voice when she exclaims, “Look out boys!” on “Running With the Hurricane,” when she almost breaks into a yelp on the chorus of “Jealous” — but the space between albums has allowed the group to develop the confidence needed to further refine their sound. When not occupied by her day job in the nursing field, Maq spent the pandemic re-training her voice — and the transformation is especially evident on album opener, “Caroline” as she envelopes the song in soft, almost hushed sweet nothings. While devotees of the band might balk at the thought of a “finely tuned” Camp Cope, the evolution displayed here is merely an expansion of the groundwork previously laid by the band rather than a complete reinvention. Even at their most DIY, Camp Cope was unabashedly emotive and earnest; on  Running With the Hurricane , the trio leans into these elements for their own benefit.   On “Blue,” the band flirts with country, the song’s chorus buffeted by lush vocal harmonies that evoke the early output of The Chicks as Maq tackles the anxieties of appearing too over-eager to a love interest. “Phone in my hand, still checking if you called,” she sings. “I’m double texting/No, I’ve never been cool.” (The concept of “double texting” makes more than one appearance on  Running With the Hurricane , tethering the album to the stresses of a hyper-connected, always-online world.) “Jealous,” another album highlight, is an indie pop earworm about a partner so emotionally distant that their dog becomes the target of Maq’s envy. Propelled by a buoyant bassline from Hellmrich, the track provides a superficially gentler take on the central concept of Iggy Pop’s “I Wanna Be Your Dog,” but the subvertly sexual element still lingers beneath the surface: “Still got my collar on, it used to choke me out/I never really was into it but I’m sentimental now.” Despite the triumphs on  Running With the Hurricane , the band has a tendency to meander and linger on similar ideas over the span of several songs in a manner that feels unnecessarily repetitive. This lack of dynamism is most apparent in the record’s midsection. Yet the album’s high points reveal the full potential behind Camp Cope’s newly honed sound. Closer “Sing Your Heart Out” begins as a gentle piano ballad before culminating in a crescendo of thunderous drums and distorted guitars, as Maq reassures an unnamed subject (perhaps herself) that time heals all wounds. “You are not your past, not your mistakes/Not your money, not your pain,” she sings. “Not the years you spent inside/You can change and so can I.” It’s in these moments that  Running With the Hurricane  wields immense power in its vulnerability, giving space to uncomfortable emotions and embracing self discovery — making it a self-assured and honest endeavor from a band seemingly unafraid to go wherever the hurricane leads them.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/camp-cope-running-with-the-hurricane-1326036/
2022-03-28,Charles Aaron,2.5,"album review,Machine Gun Kelly",Machine Gun Kelly’s ‘Mainstream Sellout’ is a Self-Hating Celebrity Pop-Punk Purge,"Released last summer to tease  Machine Gun Kelly ’s sixth album, the single “Papercuts,” with its strummy Cobain-pain guitar and brain-stewing power chords, was met with a mild shrug of support. According to the proverbial “people on the Internet,” it was seen as another lateral “rock” move from the ex-mixtape rapper signed by Diddy in 2011 as a much-belated retort to Dr. Dre’s Eminem gambit. Although his 2020 pop-punk bid  Tickets to My Downfall  (helmed by Kardashian-adjacent Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker) debuted at No. 1, there were still digs at MGK’s authenticity. So, who’s to know when Kelly wrote the furious rap that’s now been added to the “album edit” of “Papercuts.” But it’s clear his mind is aswirl with such perceptions as he barks: “Y’all said I switched genres/I saw the limit and took it farther/I’m a genius, could’ve made  Donda /But this song is to my dead father,  unh .”   This is exactly the defiant, ego-flaunting sneer that has turned Colson Baker, damaged child of itinerant Christian-missionary parents, into the inked and bleached “Machine Gun Kelly,” a feuding, celebrity-coupling cutie chameleon who careens from stage to gossip site to lawsuit. Like Pete Davidson — who giggles through a cameo on  Mainstream Sellout  — he sparks reactions that blaze up into money.   Take the gleefully derivative “Emo Girl,” which cross-references multiple pop-culture niches and has already inspired a “Butt Rock Girl” parody. Boosted by live-wire foil Willow, a.k.a., Will Smith’s daughter, “Emo Girl” opens with a clip of the 2009 horror comedy  Jennifer’s Body  (current subversive feminist/queer touchstone), in which the title character, played by Megan Fox (Kelly’s current paramour), plainly states, “I am a god.” (Is this another troll by the weed bud of Ye’s ex-wife’s boyfriend?) The song seamlessly blends Avril Lavigne’s “Sk8ter Boi” with Good Charlotte’s “Riot Girl” and when Kelly reins in his yelpy tiks, the buzzsaw-bubblegum sticks. But such mirth and mayhem are not  Mainstream Sellout ‘s goal. Assisted by Barker, his drummer/spirit guide, Kelly makes an evolving, not-very-joyful noise that nods to his old noise and inspires him to purge. The resulting sentiment:  I suck and I want to die . Song after song refers to dying, suicide, imagining himself or someone else dead, or viewing love as a zombie apocalypse. Lyrically, it’s his lingua franca. On opener “Born With Horns,” over a double-time breakbeat and slashes of guitar, he rap-moans “I don’t want to live anymore” and concludes on the more endearing, less snotty chorus, “In this film, I know there’s no happy endings.” He repeats that line in album closer “Twin Flame,” his attempt at a “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” with acoustic guitar and piano. On “Twin Flame,” as elsewhere, he’s broken and she’s too good, too pure, too magic for him, so it’s time to check out. Kelly, at age 31, hasn’t realized that introspective songwriting doesn’t stop at admitting you’re a narcissistic piece of garbage. The title track — not quite two minutes of alt-Nineties chum — has an Auto-Tuned MGK crooning and wailing insults hurled by others. (A vocal-fried Megan Fox pops up, asking, “Does he even, like, play guitar?”) But the song sputters out and it’s on to “Make Up Sex,” where he boasts, “Face down, laid pipe/Waterworks, swam in your pool.” All together now, “YECCHH!” For the most part, Kelly uses rock to express his pain and rap to escape from it, i.e., abusing substances with Lil Wayne on two fairly pointless tracks. He has a nice rapport with Iann Dior on the pleasant pop-rock exercise “Fake Love Don’t Last.” But whether Kelly deploys “rock,” “rap,” or “pop,” selling out and annoying people online are the least of his issues. Maybe next time, his self-loathing death wishes could be the jumping-off point, not the be-all, end-all.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/review-machine-gun-kelly-mainstream-sellout-1324683/
2022-03-31,Brittany Spanos,4,"Red Hot Chili Peppers,The Red Hot Chili Peppers",The Red Hot Chili Peppers Return to Their Californicating Glory With ‘Unlimited Love’,"When we think of the  Red Hot Chili Peppers  at their best — making rock that was both breezily Californian and exceedingly funky — guitarist John Frusciante has always been the heartbeat of that sound. Of course, Frusciante’s experience with the band has been tempestuous. He’s quit twice, most recently parting ways with the group after the tour for their massive double album  Stadium Arcadium  in 2009.  But in 2019, fans of the Chili Peppers were pleasantly shocked by news of Frusciante’s return.  Along with Frusciante, they’ve also reunited with Rick Rubin, who produced every RHCP album from 1992’s  Blood Sugar Sex Magik  to 2011’s  I’m With You,  their first with Frusciante’s replacement, Josh Klinghoffer. The result is vintage RHCP: a jammy, melodic effort that blends the wavy reflections of their 1999 triumph,  Californication,  with the expansive rock of  Stadium Aracadium.   On lead single “Black Summer,” Frusciante vamps and singer Anthony Kiedis serves up a wacky little Irish pirate accent. The band tends to get a lot of flak for Kiedis’ lyrics, a sometimes confounding stream of consciousness that would leave James Joyce scratching his head. But for fans, this is often what makes them so delightful, and if you dig beneath the sometimes- muddled surface, there is often a deeper message. Some of the songs here, including “Black Summer,” address underlying climate and Earth anxiety. On “The Great Apes,” a kind of booming arena-rock singalong, Kiedis begs, “I just want the great apes to be free.”   Much of the album feels like a tour of the band’s greatest tropes. Take the funky “Aquatic Mouth Dance,” which feels like an ode to their funk-rap past, as Flea slaps the bass beneath Kiedis spitting a mix of random references and sometimes earnest yearning. Moving the song forward is a flush of horns, a surprising and gorgeous addition to many of the tracks on the album.  Cuts like the highlight “White Braids & Pillow Chair,” “It’s Only Natural,” “She’s a Lover,” and “Veronica” are often silly love songs (“I could spend my nights with you/This pussywillow,” Kiedis offers), but they’re genuinely tender, evoking the oceanic feelings of the more restrained moments of Seventies FM rock on  Californication  and 2002’s  By the Way.   More than anything, this record feels like a coming home. There’s a certain magic that happens with these four musicians, and Frusciante’s absence always leaves a piece of the puzzle missing. Thankfully, he always finds his way back.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/the-red-hot-chili-peppers-unlimited-love-1330017/
2022-04-05,Mosi Reeves,2.5,,J. Cole Surveys His Empire on the Low-Stakes Mixtape ‘D-Day’,"Earlier this year, a debate briefly flared on social media: where have the superstars gone? What happened to the days when Kendrick Lamar and Drake battled for global supremacy, Kanye West elicited praise from the likes of David Lynch, the Future Hive controlled rap Twitter, Lil Wayne was the best rapper alive, and Nicki Minaj commanded the Hot 100? With those “stadium status” acts largely past their imperial phases – perhaps the jury is out on Pulitzer Kenny, who has yet to issue a follow up to his 2017 album  DAMN  – the genre seems irrevocably atomized. Tyler, the Creator tours arenas without a radio hit. Cardi B earns millions while only releasing a song or two a year. Still, even new-gen rappers like Lil Durk who equate doing numbers with millions of streams instead of iTunes and CD sales know that  critical mass is important , no matter how elusive it may be. It’s why J Cole, a man who often gets treated like the Andy Murray of arena rap, spends the final track of  D-Day: A Gangsta Grillz Mixtape  reasserting his superiority. “Some people think I’m runnin’ in third, they threw the bronze at me/Behind Drake and (K) Dot, yeah them niggas is superstars to me,” he raps on “Heavens EP.” Cole admits he can seem awkward and distant, “keepin’ my kids away from the gaze of the public.” He’s made a career out of these conflicted feelings, delivering albums that teeter between disarming introspection and trad rap boasts, evoking the days of “O’Shea aiming a gun at your brain” without the rhetorical confidence Ice Cube wielded so freely. “I piss in the celebrity tea,” Cole claims…except when he needs appreciation like everyone else.   “Heavens EP” is the most insightful track on  D-Day: A Gangsta Grillz Mixtape , which was released in conjunction with the 2022 edition of the Dreamville Festival in Raleigh, North Carolina. The rest feels entertainingly low stakes. It kicks off “Stick,” an impressively charged cipher between Cole, J.I.D., Kenny Mason, and Sheck Wes. The horn fanfare is reminiscent of Cole’s “Middle Child” from the previous Dreamville comp, 2019’s  Revenge of the Dreamers III . “Hand on my dick and hand on my gun/One is for shooting off and one is for fun,” J.I.D. rhymes. Meanwhile, DJ Drama sprinkles the track with automatic machine-gun fire, then lathers the first half of the tape with outrageously aggressive ad-libs. He uses Lute, Cozz and Omen’s “Starting 5” to crack wise about Will Smith’s Oscar slap. “Keep playing with Dreamville’s name. Don’t get Chris Rock’ed out your socks!” Drama bellows. As for the rest, pick your pleasures. Ari Lennox sounds off on a bad boyfriend for the saucy “Coming Down,” then offers some icky sexual metaphors on “Blackberry Sap.” Earthgang and 2 Chainz join forces, leading to the disappointingly muted “Ghetto Gods Freestyle.” Cozz flows with palpable hunger on “Big Trouble Freestyle,” which is set to the beat from the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Who Shot Ya.” As a prospect who hasn’t quite made an impact yet, Cozz sounds eager to make the most of  D-Day ; that same workmanlike energy enlivens “Starting 5.” But in the end,  D-Day  is more content for the Dreamville metaverse, the kind of project on which empires are sustained but not won.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/j-cole-surveys-his-empire-on-the-low-stakes-mixtape-d-day-1331255/
2022-04-07,Kory Grow,2.5,Jack White,"Jack White’s ‘Fear of the Dawn’ is a Bizarre, Euphoric Experiment","“When you cut into the present, the future leaks out,” declares a craggy voiced sample of late Beat novelist William S. Burroughs near the middle of  Jack White ’s avant-rock tune “Into the Twilight.” In the Fifties, the  Naked Lunch  author popularized an radical style of writing he dubbed “the cut-up technique,” which involved typing out his thoughts, vivisecting the sheet of paper, and then rearranging the composition into something new, hoping the words made new sense in a new order. That spirit seems to be what modern-art enthusiast Jack White (remember  De Stijl ?) was chasing on  Fear of the Dawn , the sometimes euphoric, sometimes bizarre solo album he made during the quarantine years. “Into the Twilight” begins with jazzy “ba-da-da” vocal scatting (courtesy of a Manhattan Transfer sample), then interpolates trip-hoppy drumming, samples of voices sped up to helium pitches that sound like ear candy from early Nineties Prince albums, and buzzsaw guitar divebombs. But, like Burroughs’ writing, it still makes some sense. White still plays icky-thumping blues riffs, and his head voice still sounds like Robert Plant howling to Valhalla even if the lyrics don’t say much (“Here in the night, everything’s right” is about as revealing as it gets.) It’s essentially a rock-soul-jazz-poetry collage, and if you were to distill it down to its individual elements, each part may sound enjoyable — but as a nearly five-minute song, it’s still a freight train of confusion. That’s because the problem with experimental art is that sometimes experiments fail.   Unfortunately,  Fear of the Dawn  — the first of two records White will release this year — feels like a hodgepodge of good intentions and so-so execution. The best songs here are the ones where White listens to his instincts and doesn’t let his concepts get in the way of a great hook. “That Was Then (This Is Now)” fuses the manic blues explosions of White Stripes with his ambitious jazz tangents without losing the plot; “Taking Me Back,” a straight-head rocker White recorded entirely by himself, sounds focused and hummable even if the guitar tone is a little overcooked; and “Eosophobia (Reprise)” features some of White’s most inspired guitar wah-wahing to date but still suffers from lyrics like “At night there is no light, I’m not wrong” (which reads as though it were written via planchette). But it all comes undone when allows his ambitions to become metaphysical. His wanted to update Cab Calloway’s joyful scatting on “Hi-De-Ho” with a tiptoeing, modern-dance melody and some hi-de-ho’ing hip-hop verses by A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip, but it ended up sounding more like late-Nineties Big Band revival pop. And the initial “Eosophobia” (an ancient Greek cognate meaning “fear of the dawn”) is a Dr. Moreau-like hybrid of dub reggae and Jimmy Page riffing that doesn’t quite translate into “Dyer Maker.” White built “What’s the Trick?” using samples of propulsive guitar riffs, but it sounds unnatural and kind of off-putting due to his penchant for Captain Beefheart–style blurting and dance-y drum samples. The pop-song collages are sometimes jarring and sometimes recall the late Nineties when every rock band attempted to write songs with trip-hop beats (some for the better, like Garbage’s first two albums, some for the worse, like Sting’s “Desert Rose.”) White just has to hope that listeners have the same attention span (and patience) that he has. And if they don’t, he’s releasing another new album,  Entering Heaven Alive , two months later that might be more traditional; the only track he’s released from that so far, “Love Is Selfish,” is a pretty, standard-sounding acoustic tune suggesting the rest of the album might serve as a chaser for the rough experiments on  Fear of the Dawn . The problem with cutting into the present and expecting the future is that the future isn’t always what you’ve hoped for.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/jack-white-fear-of-the-dawn-1332737/
2022-04-07,Joe Gross,3.5,,‘Terror Twilight (Horizontal Farewell)’ Is a Deep Dive Into Pavement’s Strange Final Chapter,"The sound of  Terror Twilight , the final album from Pavement, the Platonic ideal of 1990s indie rockers, was the guitar-waggle of frustration, the warp and woof of a brilliant songwriter and still-more-brilliant guitarist struggling against the limits of a band he’d outgrown. By 1999, Pavement leader Stephen Malkmus had long lapped his bandmates, the gents with whom he defined a genre for a solid decade, and on  Terror Twilight , reissued in this glorious fan-service-ish package, one can hear it in every note of that progression and struggle. Following their 1997 album  Brighten the Corners,  an album of elegant guitarscapes and late-twentysomething epiphanies,  Terror Twilight , with its languorous soft-rock melodies, crystalline sound courtesy of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, and jaw-dropping guitar solos, pointed the way toward the next 20 years of Malkmus’ solo career.   But it sounds, even decades later, oddly off from Pavement’s previous work, and the band knows it. In the canny liner notes for this reissue, guitarist Scott Kannberg calls it their  All Shook Down , a reference to the final Replacements album, a record clearly designed to be the solo debut of the band’s songwriter, Paul Westerberg. This is absolutely correct — many Pavement fans blanched at the proggier structures of songs such as the jarring “Platform Blues” and the marvelous jam “The Hexx.” But they also got their deepest sense yet of just how gorgeous a soloist Malkmus could be, bringing together generations of guitar thinkers from Neil Young and Richard Thompson to Tom Verlaine and Robert Quine. It’s perfect foreshadowing for his 21st-century solo records, which have just gotten guitar-loopier by the year.   This album’s story is a mess. The band convened at Echo Canyon, Sonic Youth’s space in New York, only to have Godrich declare it inadequate. A few nicer studios later, Pavement produced an album unlike their others — where once was mid-fi grit, there was now Godrich’s sheen. Where all of the other Pavement albums sounded recorded rather than worked over,  Terror Twilight  felt capital-P produced, with fizzy intros and outros all over the place. The LP version of this behemoth reissue uses the running order Godrich came up with — difficult songs first, singles buried in the middle. Some will find it revelatory (still more might say “what’s a running order?”). And those singles are still incredible. “Spit on a Stranger” and “Major Leagues” are some of Malkmus’ finest work, blissful California melodies and romantic swagger. The laid-back grooves on “Creme of Gold” and “You Are a Light” have aged shockingly well. (“Carrot Rope,” on the other hand, remains terrible, and the tossed-off-sounding previously unreleased “Be the Hook” absolutely should have replaced it.) The extras are a feast for serious Pavement lunatics. There are takes from the Echo Canyon sessions, Malkmus’ home demos with rickety drum machines, and a few live tracks from what fans might remember as a very crabby (but well-played) tour. One can assemble a much scruffier version of this alternately staggering and frustrating album (including Kannberg’s songs such as “Stub Your Toe” and “Your Time to Change” which didn’t make the cut the first time around and ended up as B sides ). But then, that wouldn’t quite be  Terror Twilight,  the swan song that left fans of a generation-defining band wondering what would come next.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/pavement-terror-twilight-horizontal-farewell-1331261/
2022-02-25,Mosi Reeves,3.5,,Earthgang Push Southern Rap into the Future on ‘Ghetto Gods’,"What a difference two years make. On 2019’s  Mirrorland , Earthgang conjured a stew of Black music idioms – trap, sampled soul, Southern blues, percussive polyrhythms – with audible joy. Breaking into  Billboard’s  top 40 albums chart, the album established Olu (a.k.a. Johnny Venus) and WowGr8 (a.k.a. Doctur Dot) as one of the more imaginative hip-hop acts to emerge in recent years, albeit one bedeviled by comparisons to ATL’s greatest duo, Outkast. Yes, Olu harmonizes with a yelp reminiscent of Andre 3000 at his most animated. But Earthgang is also a distinctly post-millennial group that blurs together inspirations with open-minded passion, and without the ornery defensiveness that defined so much early Dirty South rap.   In 2022, Earthgang still sound like they’re spreading their wings to embrace the opportunities and challenges that life brings them. But they’ve also grown reflective, the result of the same political turmoil, pandemic disruptions, and increasing awareness of global injustice that affects everyone’s mental health. Despite guest appearances by Dungeon Family vets like Cee-Lo and Future as well as executive production by Kawan “KP” Prather (alongside longtime managers Sincethe80s),  Ghetto Gods  is not Earthgang’s version of Outkast’s world-weary classic  ATLiens . Even when discussing serious issues, their voices are tinged with optimism. It   hearkens to other recent hip-hop albums that unashamedly focus on self-care like D Smoke’s  Black Habits , Cordae’s  The Lost Boy  and Topaz Jones’s  Don’t Go Tellin’ Your Mama . It also contains some of the most poignant material of Earthgang’s career.   Opening with a cosign from 2Chainz, who calls the duo “diamonds in the rough” on “The Glow,”  Ghetto Gods  opens with a flurry of turn-up cuts. “Still a Westside n*gg*,” says Olu on “Billi,” just before Future follows with a typical murmured verse about “bandos” and “posted up with the demons.” “Waterboyz” is a braggadocious cipher between Earthgang and Dreamville compatriots JID and J. Cole. “Amen” draws on a loop from Musiq Soulchild’s “Just Friends (Sunny)” to ask for benediction: “Get down on your knees for me if you really love me,” they harmonize. Musiq himself shows up, too, as if he’s engaging with a ghost from his past; it’s reminiscent of Usher guesting over his own R&B classic “You Make Me Wanna…” for Summer Walker’s 2019 single “Come Thru.” These cameos not only bring star power, but also highlight Earthgang’s relative lack of vocal presence. It’s not hard to notice that Cee-Lo takes over “Power” with lessons about life as a pop superstar before his scandal-plagued fall from grace, and J Cole grabs a hold of “Waterboyz” like a basketball player making a steal and driving to the hoop for a dunk. Even Yung Baby Tate speed-raps into the spotlight of “Black Pearls,” a somewhat conflicted appreciation of women who define how they want to look, whether it’s with a “new (surgically enhanced) body” or not. WowGr8 has a sharp mid-range voice, while Olu  raps in a higher pitch. Their lyrics are full of quotables, like when WowGr8  discusses gentrification in “American Horror Story” by wryly commenting, “There goes the neighborhood…Now they comin’ back to take the hood.” Sonically, though, the duo is greater than the sum of its parts. Only time will tell how  Ghetto Gods  will be remembered. Its musical colors are less vivid than  Mirrorland . But some of these songs hit hard with palpable emotion, and their impact deepens with each fresh listening. “Strong Friends” generously extends a “safe space” to Earthgang’s kinfolk, and “All Eyes on Me” questions the limits of empathy. “Pack my whole life’s precious moments in a line/Shawty singing my songs, she think she knows what’s on my mind,” harmonizes Olu. On the closing number “Run Too,” they announce themselves as blessed men of the world despite its problems, and Ari Lennox harmonizes on the chorus, “What a life this is.” Earthgang may be informed by classic Southern arcana, but the future is clearly in their hands.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/earrhgang-ghetto-gods-1290286/
2022-02-25,Brittany Spanos,4,,Avril Lavigne Gets Back to Her Aughts Emo Bubble-Punk Roots on the Absolutely Killer ‘Love Sux’,"In 2002, Avril Lavigne’s skate-punk aesthetic and emo-but-energized angst quickly made her the queen of the aughts pop-punk revival scene. Since her third album, 2007’s  The Best Damn Thing ,  she’s ebbed and flowed, dipping her toes in bubblegum pop and more self-serious pop rock. Her seventh album,  Love Sux,  brings her back to her roots, bridging the gap between her early emo vibe with the bubblegum confidence that brought her away from it. Lavigne packs the album, which is just under 40 minutes, with ferocious energy. She partnered with ska-heavyweight-turned-pop-punk-whisperer John Feldmann (5SOS, Blink-182) and boyfriend Mod Sun, who recently made the Machine Gun Kelly-esque pivot from hip-hop to rock. Travis Barker, who signed Lavigne to his imprint DTA, assists along the way. The final product is crisp and fun, launching with the explosive “Cannonball,” a song that feels like it could’ve easily snuck out of the demos from her 2002 debut,  Let Go .   Conceptually,  Love Sux  is about exactly what the title promises: all the ways “bois” suck and lie and break hearts. She injects “Girlfriend” level brattiness into lead single “Bite Me”: “You should’ve known better, better/To fuck with someone like me/(Hey you) Forever and ever you’re gonna wish I was your wifey.” On title track, she pops off some taunting  na-na-na ‘s before stating “When I think of you, I just wanna throw up.”   Machine Gun Kelly and Blackbear make enthusiastic duet partners on the songs they’re featured on, but it’s Blink’s Mark Hoppus who channels “Dammit”-era Blink-182 for “All I Wanted,” a cut that feels timeless with these two sparring in the middle of their lovers’ quarrel. Across the board, Lavigne sounds like she’s having good, real fun for the first time in ages. If the album is following a major pop-punk trend in pop music, it also serves as a reminder that Lavigne helped shape so much of that sound in the first place.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/avril-lavigne-love-sux-1311145/
2022-02-28,Mosi Reeves,3.5,,Robert Glasper Gets Deep Into ‘This R&B Shit’ as He Strives for Community and Renewal on ‘Black Radio III’,"It’s been nearly nine years since the Robert Glasper Experiment released  Black Radio II , the second, Grammy-winning installment of his mélange of contemporary jazz, beat-heavy hip-hop, and neo-soul melodies. Since then, Glasper disbanded the Experiment, embarked on soundtrack work such as the 2020 film  The Photograph  and the  Bel-Air  TV series with Terrace Martin, and engaged himself in  damaging  social media controversies. There has been a resurgence in popular support for jazz, too, and that’s partly thanks to Glasper (he contributed to Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 masterwork  To Pimp a Butterfly ) as well as key recordings by Martin, Kamasi Washington, Nubya Garcia, Floating Points, and many others.   As an aesthetic,  Black Radio  may no longer carry the same vital energy as Glasper’s original statement, which pushed back against the marginalization of “real” jazz from the pop mainstream. He won that argument. But the Glasper sound remains. “I’m in this R&B shit now,” he said in  a recent interview .  Black Radio III  should fulfill expectations generated by the first, excellent 2011 album (as well as its solid but less revelatory 2013 follow-up). There are starry, honeyed voices; J Dilla-esque rhythms, and themes of love and community renewal.   A few surprises lie amid the familiar pleasures. Esperanza Spalding sings delightfully in French over the funk fusion of “While We Speak.” Justin Tyson’s drumming underneath H.E.R.’s lead vocal on “Better Than I Imagined” gives that track a dynamic pulse. It closes with an entreaty from Meshell Ndegeocello to her lover as she alludes to a distance created by the pandemic, and her warm baritone feels as comforting as a blanket. Meanwhile, Tears for Fears’ “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” has gotten the R&B treatment before — see Anthony David’s 2011 cover — but any interpretation by Lalah Hathaway is always welcome. It’s great to hear Posdnous, too, as the De la Soul hero slides alongside Musiq Soulchild over the deep house of “Everybody Love.” Despite the Experiment’s demise, former band members such as bassist Derrick Hodge and drummer Chris Dave add instrumentation. Other players include DJ Jahi Sundance as well as DJ Jazzy Jeff, the latter chipping in on “Black Superhero,” a roundelay between BJ the Chicago Kid, Killer Mike, and Big K.R.I.T. The best moments retain Glasper’s jazz perspective, whether it’s his own piano flurries that close “Shine” or the gruff, emotive presence of Gregory Porter on “It Don’t Matter.” But too many numbers regurgitate the same Black adult-contemporary template, making it difficult to distinguish “It Don’t Matter” from Jennifer Hudson’s “Out of My Hands.” And the album closes with a handful of weaker cuts like Ty Dolla $ign and “Bright Lights.” As an enjoyable fan-service sequel intended to offer music of comfort and solace,  Black Radio III  is fine. As an artist, Glasper is allowed to get into his beatmaker bag, relaunch the  Black Radio  brand, and leave the New Jazz Thing bleeding edge to others. But one can’t help but wish the stakes were a bit higher.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/robert-glasper-delves-into-that-rb-shit-in-search-of-hope-and-solace-on-black-radio-iii-1313013/
2022-03-04,Jonathan Bernstein,3,Dolly Parton,"Dolly Parton’s ‘Run, Rose, Run’ Is a Sturdy Reminder of Her Songwriting Greatness and Vocal Command","Dolly Parton  tends to release records for a reason. Unlike her Seventies contemporary Willie Nelson, who, at a dozen years her senior, records albums for no other purpose than to suit his own whims, Parton’s release schedule over the past half-dozen years has largely served as an extension of her unceasing global brand: 2016’s  Pure & Simple , her last album of adult originals not directly tied to a larger piece of Dolly multimedia, launched a worldwide tour and kickstarted the ongoing Parton revival. In the years since, there have been a series of kids records (2017’s  I Believe in You ), soundtrack albums ( Dumplin’ ), and holiday collections (2020’s  A Holly Dolly Christmas ).   The latest Parton project is  Run, Rose, Run , a bluegrass-tinged set of originals that serves, naturally, as a companion to the forthcoming mystery novel Parton co-authored with best-seller James Patterson. As a bonus add-on to the book,  Run, Rose, Run  works far better than anyone could hope for: the songs themselves, all written by Parton, are sturdy studies in traditional country, with several unexpected stunners. But  Run, Rose, Run , which feels mired by its tossed-off production, falls short of thriving on its own terms as a studio album.   First, the highlights: This album shows off Parton’s dexterity — as vocalist and writer — in a wide range of country and roots styles, from the traditional Eighties-style duet “Demons” with Ben Haggard (Merle’s son), to the chilling Appalachian balladry of “Blue Bonnet Breeze,” to the fast-paced Stanley Brothers-indebted mountain music of “Dark Knight, Bright Future.” It’s a thrill to hear Parton, at 76, so firmly in command of her own artistry. The main fault of Parton’s latest, then, apart from the sense that the album needs a companion novel to make sense of its own narrative, is its lackluster production. The record’s high Nashville gloss feels dated and applied indiscriminately, tending to flatten out the breakneck bluegrass originals (“Run”) while depriving the record’s most introspective moments of their drama. Parton sings about the devastating effects of holding secrets too long on “Secrets,” but the song’s arrangement (cheesy background vocals, sleek electric guitar, and tinkling keys) feel like their own protective layering preventing Parton’s song from expressing itself. Run, Rose, Run  is an impressive display of Parton’s songwriting and vocal mastery that nevertheless leaves one hoping she one day releases the classic late-era record she’s so clearly primed to make, should she choose.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/dolly-partons-run-rose-run-1316110/
2022-03-16,David Browne,4,"Kim Gordon,Lee Ranaldo,Sonic Youth,Thurston Moore",Kick Out the Alt Jams: Sonic Youth Go Instrumental on Rarities Comp,"By their third and last decade,  Sonic Youth  opted for their version of chilling out. Rather than reconceiving the idea and very sound of rock (the Eighties) or trying to contour their maelstrom for the mainstream (the Nineties), they spent the 2000s easing into their status as indie-rock heroes. As heard on 2002’s  Murray Street  and 2004’s  Sonic Nurse , their music retained its ability to fly off the rails at any time but also felt looser, more relaxed. That same feeling comes across in this collection of mostly instrumental jams from the 10 years before  Thurston Moore  and  Kim Gordon ’s marriage fell apart, taking the band with it. Culled from various website mixtapes and an earlier, multi-artist compilation for the Three Lobed label,  In/Out/In  feels less like a random collection of toss-offs and more like a lost Sonic Youth album before everyone figured out who would sing each track. “Social Static,” from the days when Jim O’Rourke lurked in the lineup, is the requisite experiment; its blend of bleeps and crashes sounds like aliens trying to work a trash compactor.   But as if taking their cue from the years when they tried to fit in with the Lollapalooza crowd, the other tracks never descend into formless feedback. The band stays locked into the grooves, so that the sprawling brute force of “Out and In” recalls the  Daydream Nation  era, “Machine” feels like a  Dirty  outtake without any of their three leading voices, and “Basement Contender” captures the brittle beauty of their latter-period work — the way a casual, strummy jam could still build into a whirlwind. Even as guitars and rock itself were starting to take a cultural back seat, Sonic Youth could still make the unhurried sound thrillingly harried.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/sonic-youth-in-out-in-2-1320421/
2022-03-17,Julyssa Lopez,3.5,Charli XCX,Charli XCX Outsmarts the Pop Machine on ‘Crash’,"It’s been flat-out exhilarating to watch  Charli XCX  elude conventional stardom for so many years. Though she’s thrown some tracks into the commercial vortex, she’s been too much of a free-thinking weirdo to let her boundless creativity get crushed out by mainstream expectations. Instead, she found a way to feed the industry massive, ultra-hooky bangers by writing on other artists’ tracks  —  Icona Pop’s “I Love It,” Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy,” Selena Gomez’s “Same Old Love”  —  and helping them cannonball onto the charts. When it came to her own work, her sound fully clicked when she began spiraling out to the outer limits of the underground and avant-pop worlds, picking up bionic hyperpop influences and letting her brilliant, bizarro impulses take over. She’s a self-proclaimed “anti-pop star,” always outrunning the pop flywheel.   That is, until now.  Crash ,   her fifth and final on Atlantic Records,   is the glitziest, most maximalist version of Charli ever. But to be clear, she’s not exactly surrendering to the shiny allure of commercial fame. Charli has said she’s “very into making ultimate pop music” and that she’s been wanting her “main pop-girl moment,” but she’s also forever an art-school kid. She conceived  Crash  as a kind of concept record that interrogates the idea of an artist selling her soul to churn out mega-bops on a major label. She’s incorporated macabre, blood-splattered visuals in the album rollout, building a villainous pop princess who dances on the grave of the old Charli we knew. As a strategy, it’s masterfully smart: She gets to poke fun at the artificialities of celebrity and the big, bad label machine in an extremely Charli way, while firing out songs with the potential to become gargantuan hits.   This all makes  Crash  unabashed pop glitter — with a wink. Charli starts with the album’s title track, a song that embraces chaos and acknowledges that if she’s going to take a giant gamble on this project, why not go out in a blaze of glory? “I’m high-voltage, self-destructive, end it all so legendary,” she sings over blindingly bright production. She bedazzles the rest of the music with gleeful touches that feel like they were plucked from synth-filled dancefloors, disco roller rinks, and Eighties throwback bashes. Some of it, unfortunately, can be a little forgettable — the single “Baby” came out earlier this month and already feels like it’s faded into the fray. But  Crash  works when it’s looked at as Charli seizing a pop conversation that’s already been happening, and it’s particularly exciting when she enlists rebel-minded artists like Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens for the soaring “New Shapes” and Rina Sawayama for the “Beg For You.” If she’s crashing the mainstream party, she’s taking all the left-of-center girlies with her. Not everyone has been into the new approach. People have called bullshit on the whole commercial-subversion concept, seeing it instead as an excuse for her to make “generic radio garbage.” Charli actually took a social media break after the backlash intensified, but not before reveling in her ability to stir things up. “People be mad that i’m testing the major label system an art piece whilst still making bops … and honestly i love it,” she  tweeted . It’s true that some of Charli’s best songs have always been more electro-avant, which was part of the draw of  How I’m Feeling Now , the 2020 adrenaline-packed album that felt like a bunch of tiny thunderbolts stuffed in a jewelry box. There are a few jolts of that on  Crash , like “Lightning” and the spangled ballad “Every Rule,” but not a lot, to the chagrin of listeners who love that side of Charli. At the same time, it’s worth wondering how much longer she could have kept the sound going. Charli had already predicted the hyperpop wave years ago, teaming up with people like the late visionary Sophie before more of the world discovered her. Now that hyperpop is flickering around in the mainstream, Charli moving onto something else actually makes a lot of sense. Her pop swing feels even ballsier because it recalls the some of the energy from her 2014 studio debut,  Sucker,  released after she emerged as a teen prodigy on MySpace. For years, it seemed like she’d left a lot of that behind, making this one of the least expected directions she could have taken.   Plus, it’s fun. The most auteur-y auteurs, like Arca, FKA Twigs, and Rosalia, have gone deeper into mainstream sound pools over the last couple of years, so Charli’s not exactly alone — she’s just more direct. She’s been honest about how much she adores the boldness of pop, and she’s been so good at crafting sticky, soaring blockbusters anyway. Here, she’s simply storming the gates head on.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/charli-xcx-crash-album-review-1317693/
2022-03-18,Julyssa Lopez,4,Rosalía,"Rosalía’s ‘Motomami’ Is Brave, Bawdy, and Completely Uncompromising","After  Rosalía  released her 2018 album  El Mal Querer , a baroque masterwork anchored in solemn flamenco traditions and glowing pop sounds, the Spanish artist’s world cracked wide open, and everything seemed to rush at her at once. There was endless praise: She was a creative genius. She was a hero of the avant-garde. She’d saved flamenco. Waves of criticism came with equal force: She wasn’t doing authentic flamenco. She wasn’t original. She was too commercial. Rosalía kept morphing in the spotlight, shapeshifting through singles, pulling from genres like reggaeton and hip-hop. She was hard to pin down, and the discourse around her became a constant. People pointed out that she was appropriating from cultures that weren’t hers; fans defended what they saw as her limitless sense of world-building. She became a lightning rod, eliciting conflicting, divergent responses, like a Rorschach test.   Rosalía’s brazen new album,  Motomami , is a reaction to all that fame, attention, and discord, one that refracts the noise that’s surrounded her for the last few years, bends it to her will and launches it back into the ether. What she offers is a dizzying, kaleidoscopic self-portrait — brash and bawdy at some turns, crushingly vulnerable at other points, and completely ridiculous when it wants to be. Rosalía is uncompromising about who she is and what she wants to do: From the first seconds of “Saoko,” the hydraulic-charged opener, Rosalía declares herself full of contradictions and metamorphoses and impulses: “I’m very much me, I transform,” she sing-raps. “I’m everything, I transform.” An almost deranged arrangement smashes together a sample of the reggaeton favorite “Saoco,” by Daddy Yankee and Wisin, warped piano chords, a jazz interlude, and blasts of distortion.   The song captures the guiding ethos of  Motomami : Nothing is sacred. Rosalía grabs giant, acrylic-tipped fistfuls of every sound at her disposal — reggaeton, bachata, salsa, electro-pop, and hip-hop, strengthening her mainstream foothold in Latin pop in particular. Throughout her entire career, she’s worked not just as a composer, singer, and lyricist, but as a producer as well, and here, she oversees a master group of collaborators that includes Michael Uzowuru, Pharrell, Tainy, Sky Rompiendo, and El Guincho. The tracks are refined and meticulously crafted, yet still teeming with a sense of movement and spontaneity. Rosalía sings about an old romance on “Candy,” a featherweight ballad that suddenly ripples with a minimal dembow beat. “Bizcochito” is so playful it sounds like an ice cream truck rolling through the neighborhood, while “Cuuute” is built on intensely high, pitched-up vocals and thuds of dark, dubby basslines. One major surge of adrenaline comes on the standout “La Combi Versace” with Tokischa, the Dominican powerhouse who joined Rosalía on the single “Linda” last year. Unlike the ornate storytelling on  El Mal Querer,  which was inspired by a 13th-century Occitan novel, a lot of her new song lyrics are loud flexes and much more colloquial. (“My swag makes you dizzy/Even your momma sings along,” she trills on “Bizcochito.”) However,  Motomami  is all about dualities and competing energies, so there’s also a side of the LP that’s weighty with emotion. “Genis” is a wrecking ball of a song that features some of the most gorgeous writing on the album. Rosalía addresses the harsh realities of a mid-pandemic world to her 10-year-old nephew, singing, “I’m somewhere I wouldn’t take you/No one’s at peace here between stars and needles/Marble stars cut into the floors/Folies all over the streets where models stroll.” An audio snippet of an older relative stressing the importance of family to her makes the song even more tender-hearted.   “Hentai”  reaches a different level of intimacy: Rosalía’s voice floats over a dreamy piano melody, singing with the warmth and delicacy of Judy Garland. “I wanna ride you like I ride my bike/Make me a tape like Spike/I whipped it until it got stiff/In the second place is fucking you/In the first place is God.” She embraces the simple, straightforward pleasures of sex, toying with expectations and contrasts while subverting the kind of lyrics that men get away with all the time. The intensity builds to a climax as Rosalía chirps “so, so, so, so, so, so good,” while machine guns fire off in the distance, evoking the production style of Rosalía’s close friend and past collaborator  Arca , whose influence is felt throughout. Occasional tests of boldness don’t pay out; the silliness of  “Chicken Teriyaki,”  for example, seems like it should live strictly on TikTok. Other moments, such as the Weeknd collaboration “La Fama,” trace the more complicated aspects of Rosalía’s artistry, specifically how as a white, European woman, she’s been left free to dive into Latin and Black Caribbean genres, collaging them together in a way that’s celebrated as high-art. “La Fama,” which is ironically about the complexities and downsides of fame, drew particular frustration for its incorporation of bachata, a Dominican genre that’s been marginalized and often ignored when it’s performed by its Black originators. Many felt that if Rosalía was going to experiment with the sound, she could have worked with a Dominican bachata artist — or not touched the genre at all. There’s a school of thinking that will shut that conversation down immediately, insisting that if the music is good, why create barriers? But quality isn’t the only end-goal; given the rampant racism and inequality in the entertainment business, there’s great value in examining the broader implications a song might have in the industry, who’s held up as the pinnacle of creativity, and what artists with massive platforms and privilege are doing to address erasure in genres from which they benefit.  Motomami  is often more interested in the act of breaking down walls than the consequences, which is part of what makes it striking, but the freedom Rosalía feels to do something doesn’t always mean she needs to.   A more straightforward homage comes on “Delirio de Grandeza,” a salsa experiment that directly honors the Afro-Cuban sonero Justo Betancourt. As Rosalía sings, the beat skips and a snippet of the Soulja Boy remix of Vistoso Bosses’ “Delirious” sneaks in. It’s an unexpected touch that’s almost sacrilegious on such a classic song. The move embodies how Rosalía disrupted traditional thinking with boundary-pushing pop sounds on  El Mal Querer , and it’s a reminder that as a musician, she’s always drawn to provocation. It holds endless allure for her, and it defines her music.

Their new EP ‘Spring’ Suggests … Maybe?,"The spring semester has arrived, and chief faculty advisor for the  Weezer  Institute of the Arts, Professor Rivers Cuomo (now officially America’s most popular Cuomo), has prepared a lecture connecting the Bard and Vivaldi to domestic conviviality. “Shakespeare makes me happy,” he declares, repeating that thesis a couple of times before concluding, “and I’m happy to be with you.” There’s acoustic guitar, and pan pipes, and a big, lush Brian May–style guitar solo playing themes from  Vivaldi’s “La Primavera”,  all complementing the Prof’s supporting arguments that Hamlet, Falstaff, and Rosalind all make him happy– happy! happy! happy!. Grading on a curve, the composition, “Opening Night,” deserves a solid B. It’s dorky, catchy, and whimsical — three qualities fans of Shakespeare and Cuomo can both appreciate — and it leads off  SZNZ: Spring , the first of four seasonally inspired Weezer EPs. The rest of their springtime retreat sounds generally more Weezerish. “Angels on Vacation” recalls the band’s  Blue Album / Green Album  power pop-rock sound with deeper shades of Joe Jackson and more Brian May coming through. (Perhaps all the Brian May worship is punning off his last name, since May is in spring.) And “Garden of Eden” contains some “doo doo doo” backup vocals that feel like nostalgic ear candy from Weezer’s original alt-rock era.   As with the corniness of “Opening Night,” Cuomo’s strong knack for vocal melodies throughout saves a lot of otherwise half-baked or cliched lyrics, which he may or may not have written on spring break. “A little bit of love goes a pretty long way,” goes one chorus (“A Little Bit of Love”), while “I’ve got all this love that I’ve been saving up … let me let it out,” goes another (“All This Love”). “The Sound of Drums” contains the line, “Let yourself be soothed by the sound of drums,” despite the fact that any parent would tell you drums sound anything but soothing. But then again, he could be saving his more profound observations for autumn or winter. And with the songs all sounding pretty upbeat and capping off at under three-and-a-half minutes,  Spring  comes off suitably lighthearted right through the closing track, “Wild at Heart,” and its C+ chorus, “Wild at heart, you’ve got me wild at heart like we used to be.” At least it sounds nice. All’s pretty well that ends pretty well.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/weezer-sznz-spring-review-1322923/
2022-03-21,Will Dukes,3.5,,Lil Durk’s ‘7220’ Is a Chill But Harrowing Trip Down Memory Lane,"Chicago’s Lil Durk raps in a wavy warble that sounds like how a codeine high from a filled-to-the-brim double cup probably feels. But there’s emotion in his register—built up from a lifetime of scrapping it out on his city’s crime-ridden South Side. That Durk manages to make it melodic is part of his hardscrabble charm. Compared to Chief Keef’s minimalist psychopath musings, or G Herbo’s bar-heavy young OG reflections, the 29-year-old offers a mellow read on drill, which he helped pioneer back in the 2010s. Durk’s seventh studio LP,  7220 , is a chill trip down memory lane, full of soothing meditations on how he made it out the mud. Born three years after the demolition of the notorious Cabrini-Green Homes began—leaving countless Chicagoans displaced and that much more vulnerable to crime—Durk’s the living embodiment of his city’s resilience. Some of his earliest memories must have been from the don’t-get-shot-for-wearing-your-hat-the-wrong-way era of the gritty 1990s. Plagued by gangs, and lacking male role models (after scores of Black men during the Clinton years got either locked up or murdered), Durk’s generation roamed the streets like a bunch of lawless child rebel soldiers. He embraces that harsh upbringing on  7220 , whose cover is a childhood photo of him shyly observing his environment. The Englewood native intends for this project—named after his grandmother’s address—to be a poignant snapshot of his fast life and times.   Opener “Started From” is a glimpse into his war-torn world, from the all-too-frequent burials to the squabbles with the neighborhood snitches. Over plaintive piano, Durk spits, “The funeral home, they know me personally ’cause I gave ’em payments/The police department, they know you personally ’cause you gave ’em statements.” And the somber “What Happened to Virgil,” where he memorializes a slain friend, is like a drill-era reboot of Ice Cube’s “Dead Homies.” Durk seems to thrive over lush productions. And on the seductive, Summer Walker–assisted “Difference Is,” he hits a smooth pocket that recalls his 2015 single, “My Beyoncé.” For all his strengths as the genre’s emotive griot, there’s a second life in the waiting for Durk as drill’s go-to-guy for R&B-friendly deep cuts. But most of these 17 songs are vivid retellings of what happens on the front lines. The drill vibes are heavy on “AHHH HA,” with its bleak synths and crisp hi-hats, over which Lil Durk takes shots at all the opps who incriminate themselves on social media: “I seen niggas really killing shit, post shit on Instagram/You doing that, you might as well go to court and say you killed the man.” It’s a sobering reminder that there’s real-life trauma implicated in the violent lifestyle that some young people carelessly glorify. Though one too many downtempo songs make things drag about halfway through, the cold-hearted  “Piss Me Off” adds some much-needed oomph, with its Gothic demented heartbeat thump. And it’s big MVP-trophy energy on “Grow Up/Keep It on Speaker, which captures some of the game-face intensity of Durk’s 2020 hit with Drake, “Laugh Now Cry Later.” His calm reminiscences here on growing up fast (“My people stealin’ TV’s, coppin’ radios to get a nod/Catch me, they gon’ kill me mama, reason: I can’t get a job”) prove that, at the end of the day, Lil Durk is a cool cat that you can’t take the jungle out of.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/lil-durks-7220-1323622/
2022-03-22,Jonathan Bernstein,3.5,Maren Morris,Maren Morris Finds A Path Away From the Middle on ‘Humble Quest’,"When  Maren Morris  released her 2018 pop breakthrough, “The Middle,” the song introduced one of her guiding philosophies with a simple question: “Why don’t you just meet me in the middle?”  Ever since debuting with 2015’s soulful singalong “My Church,” Morris has carved out her space as Nashville’s most thoughtful hitmaker, despite steering her career in seemingly unexpected directions: She’s the only pop singer who could just as credibly appear with Zedd at a Vegas nightclub and perform at the Newport Folk Festival alongside the Highwomen, her singer-songwriter supergroup. All the while, Morris has found a reliable home as a country-music centrist; her last album, 2019’s  Girl,  yielded two Number One hits on country radio.    Morris opens  Humble Quest ,  her fascinating, and proudly unresolved, third record by questioning those accolades: “Couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked/Was the one about a car and the one about a church,” she sings on “Circles Around This Town.” It’s a cutting dismissal of the system Morris is working within, and a declaration of a break with her past self. Does the rest of the LP live up to such a daring proclamation?   Yes and no. There are precisely zero churches or trucks on Morris’ latest. Instead, the Texas singer luxuriates in tasteful adult pop rock in the vein of Sheryl Crow and John Mayer, collaborating with producer Greg Kurstin, an A-list practitioner of the sound (Adele, James Blunt, Foo Fighters).  Kurstin and Morris previously collaborated on the singer’s 2019 crossover blockbuster “The Bones,” which serves as a blueprint here. If there’s a central thesis to  Humble Quest,  it’s that for Morris, and her husband, fellow country singer Ryan Hurd, the bones are, indeed, very good. This is an album devoted to grown-up love and committed relationships, suited to soundtrack any number of future milestones, from first dances (“I Can’t Love You Anymore”) to funerals (“What Would This World Do”) to friendiversaries (“Good Friends”).  Humble Quest  is at its best when it’s poking holes in its own premise, whether on the searching title track, when Morris admits she hasn’t found what she’s looking for, or on “Detour,” when she conjures the Chicks (“Might take the long way”) and admits something devastating: “Not supposed to cry when all the skies are blue,” she sings, in a photo negative of the confidence of “Circles Around This Town.” “But I was disappointed when I saw the view.”  Then there’s “Hummingbird,” an Appalachian-style folk ballad about her baby son. It’s a stark moment of intimacy that fits a sentiment she offers at the beginning of the album: “Trying to say something with meaning, something worth singing about.”  Humble Quest  works because she never pretends that it’s easy.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/maren-morris-humble-quest-1323573/
2022-02-03,Jonathan Bernstein,4,Mitski,Mitski Turns Ambiguity Into a Power Source on ‘Laurel Hell’,"“Sometimes I think I am free,”  Mitski  sings nearly halfway through her new album, “Until I find I am back in line again.” The moment comes during “Everyone,” one of the more understated, easy-to-gloss-over numbers on  Laurel Hell,  a record that both buries and embeds its meaning in synthesizer sheen. If the singer-songwriter’s previous records, like 2014’s unfettered  Bury Me At Makeout Creek  or 2016’s breakthrough  Puberty 2 , introduced Mitski Miyawaki as an open-hearted chronicler of millennial malaise, her latest work is a much more emotionally tentative offering. Working with longtime collaborator Patrick Hyland, Mitski lets her arrangements and Eighties-pastiche pop textures (swirling circus melodies, icy Pat Benatar synths) do much of the heavy narrative lifting this time around: See “There’s Nothing Left For You,” which explodes into a show tune symphony of drums, synths, and guitar when the song’s narrator pays tribute to a former lover’s need to move on (“It was your right/It was your life”). By the end of the song, the fading drum pattern resembling a human heartbeat accentuates the song’s unresolved disappointment.   On  Laurel Hell , Mitski expresses her deep discomfort with her status as indie-rock paragon by embracing the types of sounds that pop A-listers like Taylor Swift and Lorde have eschewed in recent years in favor of the sorts of stripped-down, rock-based palettes that Mitski spent the past decade perfecting.  Laurel Hell  can feel, at first, like an impenetrable record, full of guarded gloss and pop production that feels more like cold caution than anthemic summoning. That’s exactly Mitski’s point:  Laurel Hell , positioned as her comeback  after a four-year absence , often feels more like a struggling contemplation of retreat than an easy return. On a series of songs that deliberately obscure the identity of the second-person “you” Mitski is referring to at any given moment (An ex? Her past self? Her audience?), Mitski is questioning everything around her, nothing more so than her own sense of self. “There’s nothing I can do, not much I can change,’ she sings on “Heat Lightning,” which simmers like an approaching storm, “Can I give it up to you? Would that be okay?” More often than not, the songs about personal turmoil double as self-conscious career commentary: “Cause you just don’t like me, not like you used to.” That’s a line from the finale “That’s Our Lamp,” an exquisite display of terse, two-verse storytelling: Mitski concludes the record with a  High Fidelity -like sequence: staring up at the window of the home she shares with her soon-to-be-ex, fixating on the lamp in the window that they still share. Then ,  the song erupts into a cacophony of programmed horns, strings and percussion, as if Mitski is dancing off the weight of expectations surrounding her new sonic path. It’s not quite a happy ending, even if it almost sounds like one.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/mitski-laurel-hell-1293878/
2022-02-04,Tomás Mier,3.5,"album review,Jennifer Lopez,Maluma",Jennifer Lopez and Maluma Have Real Musical Chemistry on the ‘Marry Me’ Soundtrack,"Marry Me  is a fun, gaudy rom-com with a fun, gaudy soundtrack, successfully  tapping the distinct musical styles of the film’s co-stars,  Jennifer Lopez  and  Maluma , who perform together and solo throughout the LP . As Lopez put it to  Billboard ,  “You can’t have a movie about two pop stars who are performing and not have a soundtrack.” And the Latin stars deliver with a 12-track LP filled with pop ballads, club-ready bangers, and a handful of reggaeton would-be hits. Staying true to the movie’s nuptial theme, the soundtrack opens with an electric-guitar rendition of “Here Comes the Bride,” before delving into the title track, the earworm Maluma-J.Lo duet “Marry Me.” Like most of the songs on the album, the track is lyrically repetitive (“True love gotta ring, ring, ring/Church bells goin’ ring, ring, ring/You’re the queen, I’ll be the king, king, king”), but Lopez’s sugary vocals and the song’s cinematic production make it work. The ballad version of the song, on the other hand, falls flat.   In 2020, Lopez and Maluma’s sexy, all-Spanish single, “ Pa’ Ti ’,” gave fans the first taste of what the stars had to offer as a duo. That track is reprised here, capturing Lopez and Maluma’s onscreen chemistry perfectly and serving as one of the LP’s best moments. “Todo lo que tengo es pa’ ti, pa’ ti/Pase lo que pase estoy pa’ ti, pa’ ti,” they sing in the chorus. (In English: “Everything I have is for you, for you/Whatever happens, I’m for you, for you.”) When singing solo, Maluma shines brightest on the slower “Segundo” and the more danceable cheater’s lament “Uno en Un Millón,” two reggaeton songs he co-wrote with his go-to producer Edgar Barrera shortly after he was cast for the film.  Both tracks feel to be very much in the Colombian heartthrob’s wheelhouse. Along with the piano-backed “ On My Way ,” which Lopez performed on several awards shows to promote the film, her best comes on “After Love Part 1,” the reggaeton-backed “Nobody’s Watching,” and the quintessential J.Lo track “Love of My Life.” “After Love” opens stripped down, with an acoustic guitar, before crescendoing into a club-ready banger. “I believe in love, even if it wasn’t meant for us,” she sings on the track. Despite its cheesy lyrics, meant to match the rom-com, “Love of My Life” showcases the singer’s powerhouse vocals, while the playful “Nobody’s Watching” seems made ready for radio.  Though lyrically shallow, and unsurprisingly so, the LP aids  Marry Me ’ s storyline with its themes of longing, love-building, and deception. Maluma doesn’t take many risks, but he still delivers when he sticks to his known reggaeton tricks. For her part, Lopez owns the album’s ballads and bops — flashing her musical prowess and versatility at every turn.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/jennifer-lopez-maluma-marry-me-soundtrack-1292977/
2022-02-04,Jayson Buford,3,,The Trap Becomes a Retirement Home for 2 Chainz on ‘Dope Don’t Sell Itself’,"Ten years ago, Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz made it big with mainstream trap production, luxurious rhymes about champagne on airplanes, and non-sequitur punchlines. Chainz was a rapper who could out-rap legends, but his music wasn’t necessarily expansive: There wasn’t the flurry of topics, motifs, sequences, or tics you’d get from someone like Lil Wayne or Kendrick Lamar. But Chainz was good at combining humor with grandiose confidence, delivering his lines in a pinched yet expressive voice that made his music a source of constant jubilation.  Dope Don’t Sell Itself  is being marketed as Chainz’s last trap album (in July, he took to Twitter to say that it was), but it’s actually an attempt at a return to form.  Rap or Go to the League , his 2018 album executive-produced by LeBron James, presaged this semi-retirement ploy by imagining Chainz as a socially aware former trapper. The album riffed on the idea that they are only two paths to upward mobility as a Black American — a concept that it often discussed to a point of fatigue. Despite having some undeniably great moments, Chainz’s take on the sports-rap bifurcation didn’t hold up in the weight of its ambition and was missing the controlled chaos that made Chainz such a force in the early 2010s.   Dope  returns to more comfortable footing right from the start with  “Bet It Back,” on which he raps, “My favorite plastic bag got some drugs in it.” Chainz won’t be talking about the social conditions of the Black experience here; he’ll be talking about how his pockets are lined from the rap that made him who he is. “Kingpen Ghostwriter” pits him against Lil Baby with Chainz upping the tempo in a way that recalls the Mike Will Made It or Lex Luger tracks that made him a force. Chainz is at his best when he is rapping downhill, with amusing lyrics like “Didn’t have no AC on/All we had was OnlyFans.” The upstart Baby is game here, rapping a capella at one point with the Auto-Tune-laden voice that has made him a superstar. The production functions as nostalgia for the trap era and late ’90s Southern rap.  Sometimes the beats pale compared to peak Chainz. Post Malone producer FKi 1st produces, “Neighbors Know My Name,” and doesn’t do a bad job, but it sounds a little like someone reaching for DJ Mustard and landing on a TikTok beat. Detroit rapper 42 Dugg shows up on “Million Dollar Worth a Game,” behind a beat that replicates the whistle that has become Dugg’s calling card. Dugg bests Chainz here. A decade ago, Chainz would not have been out-rapped like this, but here the student has become the mentor. Dugg’s sex raps are biting and humorous at the same time, exactly what Chainz was like years ago. The best song on this record is the Mannie Fresh-produced “Free BG,” named for the Hot Boyz rapper. It’s the quintessential Atlanta track: meant for the VIP section at a club with the cigar smoke in front of your eyes blocking everything but the dancers shaking to this beat. Lil Durk shows up on “Lost Kings,” a song where Chainz painfully recounts a friend dying from a domestic incident during which he was trying to help his sister. The message is simple: All this flossing is possible because he pushed through the tribulations that were put in his way.  This record isn’t the return to form that it aims to be, but Chainz is back in his element here. A rap veteran that has been everywhere from beloved Playaz Circle songs like “Duffle Bag Boy” to mainstream hits like Kanye West’s “Mercy,” Chainz has had a career that will be fondly remembered. But the fact is, right now, he is running out of steam. The lyrics aren’t razor-sharp in their imaginativeness. Despite Hail Mary completions like “The 44 bulldog a Georgetown Hoya fan/The draco sign a nigga like an autograph,” Chainz is the veteran that the youngsters like Stove God Cooks (the Syracuse rapper who has a feature here) now go to for their “Mercy” like verses. Chainz will be admired in history, but this album doesn’t quite put a bow on an otherwise rich musical career.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/2-chainz-dope-dont-sell-itself-1295114/
2022-02-07,Joe Gross,3,,Animal Collective Trip Out in a Predictably Fun Way on ‘Time Skiffs’,"The psychedelic crew Animal Collective have spent 20 years as the answer to the musical question “What if we actually  were  the signals in Brian Wilson’s brain?” The four animals (Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Deakin, and Geologist), or some combination thereof, have built a bloodshot-eyed fanbase by cross-fading between psychedelic freak outs and solid, almost traditional pop craft, sometimes even jam-band danceable — see 2009’s still-thrilling  Merriweather Post Pavilion  LP or “Piggy Knows,” off of 2020’s otherwise obtuse  Bridge to Quiet  EP, which sported one of their most indelible hooks. While they love blending squiggly drums and discomfiting noises in ever spacier ways, their home base has always been those extremely Beach Boys-esque vocal harmonies, the human calm in their electrical storm.  Their last audio-only studio album, 2016’s  Painting With,  tended towards the song-ish. After spending the next five years stretching out every which way (rubbery EPs, visual albums, and live records), their latest,  Time Skiffs , is a gauzy nine-song ode to spacing out for just a damn minute and trying to banish the knot in one’s “This is 40” gut (literal and otherwise).   The weird years were not wasted time.  Time Skiffs  splits the difference between the pop and the avant, spaced-out family-pad music with solid drumming, deep-distance percussion, wobbly melodies, and harmonies somehow more blissed out than anything else.  See also the single “Prester John,” which features the youth-coda line “w as a good long run/With a world of good intentions by it.” Good night to the indie-rock era, indeed. On “Walker,” a delicate xylophone(?) melody urges you who are “goin’ through the motions” to “put the baggage down.” “Cherokee” (car, not person) cruises around the rural Mid-Atlantic, spacing out on synth squiggle and comfy bass, trying to figure out if an old dog can learn new tricks, or needs to.   The legitimately gorgeous closer “Royal and Desire” reminds you that this is the perfect 21st-century companion to the Beach Boys’ “Feel Flows” box set, which dropped last August, a similarly trippy attempt to find psychedelic peace within the confines of encroaching middle age. Just thank them for not going full dad-joke and calling it  Animal Reflective.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/animal-collective-time-sciffs-1292985/
2022-02-09,Jon Dolan,4.5,,‘Lucifer on the Sofa’ Might Be Spoon’s Best Record Ever,"Spoon are the most reliable great American rock band of the past 25 years. That might say more about American rock than it does about Spoon, but facts don’t lie. They’ve been at it since the mid-Nineties, and they’ve never made a dull record, thanks to leader Britt Daniel’s brilliant songwriting and a knack for nuancing their Texas indie rock. They do jittery guitar bangers; they throw in some soul; they try out electronics; they nod to Prince and the Kinks and Motown and Wire. But it always comes out sounding like Spoon: casually stylish and stunningly catchy, opaque but openhearted, bristling with the thrill of subtle invention. In fact, over the years Spoon’s run has been so consistent and drama-free you can almost take them for granted. Which is why their 10th album,  Lucifer on the Sofa,  is so welcome. It’s the best thing they’ve ever done, more than exceeding their usual quotient of fire guitars, killer choruses, and crafty rock-history updates. Whether it’s the barbed-glam stomp of “The Hardest Cut,” the sidelong Seventies sleaze of “The Devil & Mister Jones” and “Lucifer on the Sofa,” or the rarefied roadhouse grit of “Held,” Spoon have never cranked up their Spooniness so Spoonfully.   There’s definitely a post-pandemic urgency here; after a couple of albums that leaned into studio digitalia, 2014’s  They Want My Soul  and 2017’s  Hot Thoughts,  this one feels like a return to the coiled, trenchant band-in-a-room brio of LPs like their 2002 classic,  Kill the Moonlight.  “Sing my heart out, beat my chest,” Daniel sings on “My Babe.” And so he does. Proudly basic titles like “Wild,” “Feels Alright,” and “My Babe” sum up the thrill of getting back to old-fashioned rock & roll kicks. With “Wild,” Daniel lets loose a ferocious Neil Diamond homage, like he’s heroically sweating out a hot August night of the soul. He says he spent a lot of time during quarantine listening to his Tejas homies ZZ Top, and you can hear that in the way the tense, torrid guitars lash into notoriously locked-in drummer Jim Eno’s hypnotic precision on pretty much every song. For a little languid, pulse-slowing beauty, there’s the Ray Davies whimsy of “Astral Jacket.” They’ve even got a song called “On the Radio,” which sounds like what it suggests: a Nineties indie-rock guy channeling a lifetime of close listening into an ode to salvation by the FM dial. In some ways, it’s kind of an absurd sentiment in our stream-y times — kind of the 2022 equivalent of the Little River Band singing about dancing to Glenn Miller on “Reminiscing” in 1978. But Daniel delivers his dashboard gospel with the spiritual intensity of a Pentecostal holy roller.  Lucifer on the Sofa  is that kind of record, the sound of ancient dreams born again.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/spoon-lucifer-on-the-sofa-1296665/
2022-02-10,Kory Grow,4,Eddie Vedder,Eddie Vedder’s Star-Studded ‘Earthling’ Is a Reminder of His Individuality,"Eddie Vedder  has always seemed like a singer inextricably bound to his band. Since the beginnings of Pearl Jam, he has flexed his warm baritone with an intensity or a sensitivity that perfectly matched his fellow musicians’ loose fury and anxious jamming; Vedder’s voice depends on Pearl Jam’s music, and their songs demand his voice. Whenever he has ventured into the wilds of a solo career, he has done so in the least Pearl Jam-y ways possible, whether it was the folkie mandolin musings of “Rise” or the beach-fire serenades of  Ukulele Songs.  No matter how sparse a song sounded, Vedder’s voice resounded in ways that recalled Pearl Jam. You could tell he was doing his best to tiptoe around the loud rock that defines his main gig.   On his latest solo outing,  Earthling,  Vedder unapologetically backspaces onto Pearl Jam’s turf with 13 tracks that recall both the band’s punk energy and its mainstream-rock aspirations in a way that feels distinctively Vedderish. It’s his most revealing solo release, since, musically, it feels more like the Vedder we’ve known for 30 years and not a purposeful departure from Pearl Jam.   For the project, he teamed with Andrew Watt, a jack-of-all-trades producer who has proven equally deft at fashioning pop (Miley Cyrus), rap (Post Malone), and rock (Ozzy Osbourne’s surprisingly fun 2020 comeback,  Ordinary Man ), all while maintaining each artist’s uniqueness. As with Osbourne’s album, Watt assembled a core band for  Earthling  to help Vedder write the songs, and even though the ensemble features former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer and perennial Chili drummer Chad Smith, the results sound nothing like those two musicians’ other band. Instead the group, which includes Watt, complements Vedder’s voice in ways that only Pearl Jam has previously done. Vedder’s hallmark has always been the way he could sound both confident and vulnerable at the same time — has anyone sung about wanting to explode a neutron bomb more plaintively than Vedder did on Pearl Jam’s “Wishlist”? — and the moments where he hits that balance on  Earthling  make for the best songs on the record. On “Brother the Cloud,” he grapples with the loss of a loved one (possibly Chris Cornell) as he wrestles with the throes of grief — “Understand it was not easy for my friend,” he sings to anyone listening before later turning to inexplicable anger: “Put your arms around my brother, my friend/Say for me … fuck you … what are friends for?” But the whole thing is disarming since he sounds hopeful and even upbeat throughout the song. On the next song, “Fallout Today,” he parses human fragility, musing on “second chances granted one more time,” before conceding, “We all need to share and shake the pain” — all over a gently melancholic acoustic-guitar ballad. If it weren’t for Watt’s Beach Boys–style harmonies, the song could have easily fit on Pearl Jam’s  Vitalogy. Meanwhile, the heavy riffing of “Power of Right” and “Good and Evil” feel like a more refined take on the grunge of the band’s  Vs.  as Vedder sounds rejuvenated, howling in time to Smith’s locomotive rhythms. Smith’s drumming even takes lead on “Rose of Jericho,” another hard rocker, with a funky, slightly off-kilter groove that inspires a driving riff and an aggressive screed from Vedder about environmentalism that even cites Henry David Thoreau. It’s the same anger Vedder had about Trump on Pearl Jam’s last album, 2020’s  Gigaton,  but it’s more personal this time, revealing new sides of the singer with each song.   Several tracks feel like Invisible Man exhibitions of his DNA, as he inhabits the sensibilities of some of his favorite musicians without fully giving himself over to plagiarism. For any other artist, “Long  Way” would sound like Tom Petty cosplay with its lush acoustic chords and gentle chorus, nasally dragging out the word “ freeeeeway ” — the Heartbreakers’ Benmont Tench even plays organ on the song — but Vedder’s voice, with its rugged, lived-in weariness, makes it his own. Similarly, “The Dark” owes a debt to Bruce Springsteen with its hammering, Max Weinberg–like drumbeat, fuzzy synths, and the promise “I’ll find you in the dark … let me lift you out of the dark,” but Vedder sells it in a way that feel like it’s his own. Earthling’s  guests figure heavily into how Vedder reveals new sides of himself, since most of his reverence comes through in nods and winks rather than fealty. Stevie Wonder plays fluttering harmonica throughout “Try,” an upbeat rockabilly number about forgiveness, and while it’s a scene-stealer, it never distracts from the song. Tench appears here and there throughout the album, usually sweetening the arrangements. And “Mrs. Mills” owes such a debt to the grandiose pomp of  Sgt. Pepper  that it name-checks Paul McCartney and features Ringo Starr as a guest on drums. It’s only on “Picture,” a duet with Elton John, where Vedder gives in to his fandom. The track is all Elton-y country schmaltz (and, as with even the best of John’s music, sometimes it’s a little too schmaltzy). But it’s the only moment on  Earthling  that doesn’t feel distinctly Vedderish, other than in the lyrics, which sing about striving for love and hope. Those lyrics are the song’s only anchor to  Earthling’s  central theme. Throughout the album, Vedder uses each song to plead for empathy — the quality that makes earthlings human. On the uplifting album opener, “Invincible,” he sings to listeners that they’re “more than just particles” and that they should feel important, and he bares his soul even more, showing forgiveness, on the final track, “On My Way,” on a virtual duet with his biological father, Edward Severson Jr., a man he was estranged from for most of his life. “When we love, we’re invincible,” Vedder sings, reprising a lyric from the first song, this time wrapping the words around his dad’s voice. It’s a strikingly personal moment for Vedder, the type of vulnerability he has always tilted toward with Pearl Jam. Now that he’s embraced it, he has just raised the stakes for his Pearl Jam bandmates.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/eddie-vedder-earthling-review-1295457/
2022-02-11,Jon Dolan,3.5,Big Thief,Big Thief Just Made a Big Record That’s Worth Getting Lost In,"Imagine a 2022 version of the rustic harmony and song-splurge electricity of Bob Dylan and the Band’s   Basement Tapes , and you’ll have a pretty decent notion of what  Big Thief  are up to on their fifth album.  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You  is a 20-song double-LP in which the much-beloved Brooklyn band chases its indie-folk sound all over the backyard in search of new wrinkles and revelations. “Change, like the wind/Like the water, like skin,” singer Adrianne Lenker offers, signaling the album’s mutable intentions at its deliberately lovely outset. Lenker’s personal, pastoral songwriting and fragile, down-home warble are always at the center of Big Thief’s music. But after starting out as a rangy, poetically hard-bitten guitar band on their 2016 debut  Masterpiece,  they’ve pulled off the neat trick of becoming at once more rootsy and more cosmic, earthier but somehow less earthbound, suggesting Bright Eyes and Jenny Lewis fans tapping into the old, weird America as the blueprint for their dream-folk epiphanies.   The band hit a stunning creative peak with  U.F.O.F.  and  Two Hands , two equally excellent albums released six months apart in 2019.  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You  might have benefited from a similar release program, but as its dubious title suggests, an over-abundance of whimsical discovery is part of the mission here. “It’s music. It’s music!,” Lenker sings, setting the tone on “Time Escaping,” a vaulting rush of percussive anarchy, lithe melody, and ecstatic word-salad revelation. (According to the band, she was addressing her dog, who’d run into the studio during the song’s recording.) That headlong, try-everything ambition is all over the place here. The warm, rollicking, “Spud Infinity” breaks off for a comically long Jew’s-harp jam. The almost impossibly pretty jangle-core revery “No Reason” comes with a bell-booted flute solo. (John Barleycorn must live!) The title track gathers itself hazily, like a mystical vision coming into soft focus, with Lenker’s diaphanous whispers refracted through webs of ghostly acoustic playing. “Little Things” ambles athletically for nearly six minutes, as Lenker sings about falling dangerously in love in New York City as brackish guitar static and relentlessly tumbling drums mirror the scary rush of romantic obsession. Big Thief revel in the old-fashioned, mythic, and arcane, but their music is at its best when they blur eras and historical map-points. With a drum track that suggests hail on a distant tin roof, the gauzily distorted “Blurred View” lands somewhere between Nineties trip-hop and an Alan Lomax field recording.  On “Certainty,” the band shambles winsomely and Lenker sets a comfy scene: “Sit on the phone, watch TV/Romance, action, mystery,” evoking Dylan and the Band finishing up a day’s work at Big Pink and kicking back with a little Netflix and Wordle. The acoustic waltz “Dried Roses,” a sweet old-timey evocation of domesticity, is followed a couple songs later by “Wake Me Up to Drive,” with sad-Eighties guitars and a drum machine bauble beat that makes it feel a little like Lenker’s version of “Within Your Reach” by her fellow Minnesota natives the Replacements. An inspired afterthought like that might not have made the album if it was limited to the normal 12 or 13 songs.  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You  can feel redundant at points, and might be a little much to wade through unless you already roll waist-deep with the Big Thief experience. Yet the cumulative sense of the open-ended, accidental, communal, and casual is worth any slowish spots along the way. This is a band that deserves the time you lend it.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/big-thief-dragon-new-warm-mountain-i-believe-in-you-1297977/
2022-02-11,Mosi Reeves,3.5,,Mary J. Blige Keeps Challenging Herself on ‘Good Morning Gorgeous’,"Thirty years into a career as one of the best R&B artists of her generation — Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honors or not — Mary J. Blige continues to challenge herself and her fans. It’s hard to think of any peers from her early-Nineties peak, whether it’s the “queen of Christmas” Mariah Carey or the under-appreciated Brandy, who would eagerly collaborate with the likes of Fivio Foreign, the hard-edged New York drill act currently making headlines  for his protests against Hot 97’s censorious ban  on “violent” diss raps. Yet there he is on “On Top,” a track from Blige’s  Good Morning Gorgeous  that makes good use of a Three 6 Mafia’s “Who Run It” sample, jawing away about “This is my city, I’m giving aggression/None of my shooters getting arrested.”   “On Top” is proof that Blige sees herself as a living legend unwilling to retreat into Black adult-contemporary irrelevance. Her willingness to experiment with current pop trends has occasionally led her down jarring paths: See her odd 2009 single “The One,” where she delivers an ill-advised Auto-Tuned performance alongside Drake. More often, it has paid off in artistic rewards like 2014’s  The London Sessions ,  a wobbly but ultimately successful fusion of vintage hip-hop soul and R&B-inflected British pop, and 2017’s  Strength of a Woman ,  an unflinching and powerful dissection of her well-documented divorce from Kendu Isaacs.   Nearly all of Blige’s 15 albums have a conceptual framework, but  Good Morning Gorgeous  feels looser than others.  She has said  the title is based on a positive affirmation she tells herself since her well-documented divorce. That puts her new album in line with the inspirational, self-help tenets that have guided her work ever since 2001’s  No More Drama .  Still, the album flips through moods and styles. Producer Bongo by the Way opens with a percussive flourish on “No Idea,” as Blige recounts a life in the public eye: “Been doing shows since high school/To the mall then record in the mic booth.” DJ Khaled brings his signature bluster to the dancehall rhythm of “Amazing”; Anderson .Paak croons in typical throwback style over the lush grooves of “Here With Me”; Dave East drops a hard, cleareyed verse for “Rent Money.” There’s plenty of emotional tumult, as tracks like “Love Will Never” and the title song make clear. “It’s hard enough to be alone,” she sings on the latter. “I’m so tired of feeling empty.” Still, she carefully sidesteps the deep melancholy of her past .  The music is mostly hopeful and lively, even when the sentiments belie it. Longtime fans may miss the laser-sharp focus of Blige’s best albums . Yet her attempts to lighten the mood and bring some joy to her life on  Good Morning Gorgeous  is a worthy trade-off. At the album’s end, she offers a special treat: a sumptuous duet with Usher in the form of “Need Love.” The baby-maker ballad feels like a welcome flashback to the glory days of contemporary R&B, back when Blige and Usher dominated the pop-music landscape. She’s moved on from those golden years, but she hasn’t forgotten them.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/mary-j-blige-good-morning-gorgeous-1298766/
2022-02-14,Julyssa Lopez,3.5,Shamir,Shamir Rejects Expectations and Embraces Messiness on ‘Heterosexuality’,"Shamir  starts subverting expectations from the very first crackles of “Gay Agenda,” the opener from his new album  Heterosexuality . Despite the declarative, banner-like brightness the title suggests, “Gay Agenda” smolders with mounting intensity as  Shamir  battles layers of industrial fuzz and reverb. The production is a threat, constantly on the verge of overpowering him. Yet the Philly-based multi-hyphenate wins out, his hyper-specific falsetto breaking to the forefront: “You’re just stuck in the box that was made for me,” he sings. “And you’re mad I got out and I’m living free.” Throughout  Heterosexuality,  Shamir is working through, and breaking from, intimate traumas, social constraints, and limiting binaries. It’s the eighth project from the prolific singer-songwriter, and it also marks his first time working with the producer Hollow Comet. Together, they front-load the beginning of the album with songs that are abrasive and raw, buzzing with the sound of inner growth and emotional labor. Shamir’s shooting vocals are defiant over confrontational noise-pop that embodies the scalding resistance he’s built up in an oppressively heteronormative world. But Shamir, a winking renegade with a biting sense of humor and an ear for melody, also introduces music that’s light and tinselly with synth frills, playing and inventing as he defines himself beyond sexuality and gender identity. He finds something close to peace as he explores the idiosyncrasies and specifics of self that shape who he is, embracing the messiness that comes with unearthing it all.   Shamir whips through truths with abandon: “Abomination” is a political manifesto spilled out with the sing-songy sass and brutal honesty of an Azealia Banks disciple (“Say my life matter, but it’s just an option/Madam vice president’s a cop doing cop shit/Being pushed to you as progress for profit”); “Father” is a bruised look at his familial relationships. Some of the songs are so jagged and exposed, they have the double-edged effect of also feeling unfinished, especially compared to the more upbeat moments on the album. The project also doesn’t boast the tightness of Shamir’s 2020 self-titled album, which he released after parting ways with his former label XL—a move that made it clear Shamir was going to navigate the music world on his own terms. Instead,  Heterosexuality  is impulsive and unfiltered, another self-affirmation from someone who’s shared that he’s “anti-career” —and far more interested in self-discovery than a route toward the stardom. After releasing his 2015 album  Ratchet , Shamir has  said  that he didn’t feel he was in control of his art that and he “felt like I’d been wrung out for my sweet nectar and the people in charge will do what they want with it.”  Heterosexuality  is packed with signs that he won’t let that happen again. A break-up ballad called “Stability” is tucked between the IDGAF candor of “Abomination” and the slightly forgettable “Caught Up,” and it offers one telling revelation as Shamir says goodbye to a relationship that’s been weighing him down. The lyrics could easily be seen as a reflection of his own refusal to compromise in other parts of his life and work: “And I don’t want to squander this beautiful mess we made,” he sings. ” And I played along but I have to see what’s next.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/shamir-heterosexuality-1298447/
2022-02-24,Joe Gross,3.5,,Dashboard Confessional Is an Endearing Sleeve-Tat Dad on ‘All the Truth That I Can Tell’,"“I feel heavy,” Chris Carraba sings on “Burning Heart,” the first song on  All the Truth That I Can Tell , the first new Dashboard Confessional album in four years. We’re right there with you, man. For most of the 21st century, Carraba, the artist concurrently known as Dashboard Confessional, pretty well embodied the idea of “emo.” Older punks might take issue with this, but for fans perhaps not even alive in ‘85, Dashboard’s deadly earnest version of that amorphous genre tag has meant everything from college-cafe acoustic tunes (emo as shout-along folk, per his 2000 debut,  The Swiss Army Romance ) to full-band outings (emo as shout-along indie rock, per 2003 breakout  A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar  — boy, does this guy know how to name a genre-catering record).   For his ninth album, Carraba goes back to his hard-strumming roots, making his most old-school Dashboard-y collection in years (it’s even produced by James Paul Weiser, who helmed the first two albums). It’s just Carraba and the guitar and melodies that would scale up brilliantly — “Sunshine State” starts like Eighties U2 before becoming an ode to Carraba’s home state, notably not a topic Bono ever tackled.   But instead of young, heart-sleeve punk,  All the Truth  is a veritable concept album about hitting your mid-40s with full-sleeve tats, a long marriage, and a couple of kids. Carraba says the songs were written in 2019, but in June 2020, he was severely injured in a motorcycle accident which resulted in on-going physical therapy and relearning how to play guitar. With this in mind, it’s striking to hear him tackle such themes as “picking yourself off the floor” (“Here’s the Moving On”); fighting for a relationship, be it with a person, an idea, or yourself (“Burning Heart”); and how kids are awesome and remind you of yourself but everything around them is incredibly stressful all the time (“Me and Mine”). But that’s the great thing about working in a subgenre designed to make triumphant music out of personal turmoil and righteous anger — it’s a weirdly solid preparation for the clobberings of adulthood.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/dashboard-confessional-all-the-truth-that-i-can-tell-1310910/
2021-12-22,David Browne,3,"Archies,box set,Sugar","Remembering the Archies, a Fake Band Ahead of its Time","In an utterly accidental way, a  box set  devoted to the  Archies , the infamous TV cartoon band of the Sixties, couldn’t have arrived at a timelier moment. Earlier this month, we lost the Monkees’  Michael Nesmith . The band’s musical gatekeeper, the one most preoccupied with the TV-generated combo being allowed to write its own songs and play on its own records, Nesmith famously rejected “ Sugar , Sugar” — a bubblegum pop song as basic as it gets, brought to them by producer  Don Kirshner . As the late Kirshner told  RS  in 2009, Nesmith’s dismissing of the song inspired him to turn to animation: “Mike said, ‘It’s a piece of junk–I’m not doing it.’ I came home and my son Ricky was reading  Archie  comic books.” Inspired by that sight, Kirshner flashed on turning the comic into a cartoon series — and having Archie, Jughead, Veronica  and the gang perform the songs, instead of actual three-dimensional humans with opinions. “And I created the Archies,” he said. “That’s all because the Monkees wouldn’t do my song and that got me pissed off.”   Kirshner knew a hit when he heard it: In 1969, “Sugar, Sugar” (cowritten by Jeff Barry and Andy Kim) wound up knocking the Rolling Stones’ “Honky Tonk Women” out of the No. 1 spot, where it stayed for four weeks; it also became the biggest-selling hit of that year. The cartoon series, which launched in 1968, just as  The Monkees  was being cancelled, had its dopy charms. But of all the Sixties artifacts to survive and prosper five decades on, it’s doubtful that anyone, even Kirshner, would have predicted the Archies would make that list. The series is hardly remembered as a high watermark of animation, and neither are the five Archies albums —billed to the cartoon characters but sung and played by uncredited studio players — recalled as anything but forgettable cash-in product for a Saturday morning cartoon show. And yet the Archies continue being reanimated.  Riverdale , the self-consciously somber update of  Archie , revived the Archies as a “band,” albeit as a predictably gloomier one playing dour pop like “Midnight Radio.” Last month, Netflix announced a “live action musical” film version of  The Archies , to be directed by Zoya Akhtar and set in India. (And let’s not forget the way the Gorillaz inherited the cartoon-band legacy decades later, or that Bored Ape Yacht Club, those cartoon monkeys that are the talk of the NFT world, are venturing into music.) In that context, the existence of  Sugar, Sugar — The Complete Albums Collection  (Goldenlane)– which boxes all five of the Archies LPs (minus their obligatory Christmas record) — makes some sort of crazy sense. The naysayers of the time, like the emerging rock press that dismissed the Archies records as disposable junk, weren’t completely wrong. Throughout the five discs, there aren’t too many other tracks to rival the undeniable hook and “pour a little sugar on it” grit of “Sugar, Sugar.” (Even soul great Wilson Pickett  covered it , albeit as a slow-jam groove.) But the box set also serves as an instruction manual on the glories and pitfalls of bubblegum pop, lessons we’re still seeing played out today. The people behind the Archies — songwriter and producer Jeff Barry, singers Ron Dante and original female voice Toni Wine, renowned musicians like guitarist Hugh McCracken and bassist Chuck Rainey — knew what pre-teens of the time wanted —  unadulterated silliness like the Ohio Express’ “Yummy Yummy Yummy.” The first two Archies albums,  The Archies  and  Everything’s Archie , pretty much delivered on that promise. There’s a lowest common grade-school denominator to chipper bangers like the bouncy “Time to Love”; “Hot Dog,” an ode to food largely bereft of double entendres; and the “group”‘s first single, the head-over-heels  “Bang-Shang-a-Lang,” which was reminiscent of early Barry-penned hits like the Crystals’ “Da Doo Ron Ron.” But then you stumble across harder rock like “Truck Driver” (narrator tries to hitch a ride in order to find missing girlfriend) and the mildly naughty “Hide and Seek” – -which has such a funky guitar lick and backbeat that it was almost featured in  T he Get Down,  Netflix’s sadly canceled series about the early days of hip hop. (A lawsuit put a halt to those plans.) “Seventeen Ain’t Young,” a slow-high-school-dance lament about love between teens, isn’t as smarmy as it sounds. Starting with its title, “Sugar and Spice” — from their third album, 1969’s  Jingle Jangle —  wanted very much to be “Sugar, Sugar,” although it couldn’t replicate that song’s fizzy highs.  Jingle Jangle  is what one could call the Archies’ transitional third album, since they stomp a little bit harder (“Get on the Line”) and dip into Motown grooves (“She’s Putting Me Thru Changes”). You can hear the Archies — or at least the living humans behind them — aiming to grow as artists, even if novelties like “Senorita Rita” still hobble them.   Like many of their peers, animated or fleshy, team Archie wanted to be taken seriously.  Sunshine , from 1970, strained to be as relevant as possible, which meant a dose of then-voguish eco-pop (“Mr. Factory,” in which “The little fish ain’t growin’ ’cause the dirty river ain’t flowin’/Doesn’t anybody want to see it clean?”). “Waldo P. Emerson Jones” name-drops rock festivals and FM-radio gods of the day: The title poser “took his chopper up to Woodstock/And he wormed his way backstage” and “says he knows the Beatles/S&G and Jimmy Page.” (Waldo is also putting the moves on the singer’s girlfriend, which doesn’t help his case.) The lyric of “Summer Prayer for Peace” mostly amounts to rattling off the population numbers of major cities and countries, including North Vietnam. In  Sunshine , the seeds were planted for later, maturity-minded records like the Osmonds’ concept album about Mormonism ( The Plan ) and the Jonas Brothers’ somber-minded  Lines, Vines and Trying Times.  And as with  Sunshine,  those records were also hit-free as a result. Sunshine  peaked at a lowly no. 137 on the  Billboard  Top 200. Not surprisingly, their Archies’ farewell, 1971’s  This Is Love , returned to bubblepop basics, only revealing a few nods at musical sophistication (the percussion, horns and funky bass on “What Goes On”). Their weakest set, it didn’t make the charts at all. By then, the Archies were old Saturday-morning news next to the ascendant Partridge Family (whose winsome harmonies, also courtesy studio players, echoed those of the Archies) as well as the Osmonds and the far superior, and meatier, Jackson 5. With that, the Archies crashed and burned, at least until the recent revivals. But for so many pop acts to follow, they sent up a warning flare: Stick with what you know and mature at your own risk, even if you’re made of cartoon cels.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/were-the-archies-review-1272309/
2022-01-07,Will Dukes,4,The Weeknd,The Weeknd Hits a New Peak on ‘Dawn FM’,"It’s been a few years since  The Weeknd  went full-on pop star. Early in his career, the Canadian crooner refused to reveal his identity and sang dark songs about sex, drugs, and longing. His seminal 2011 mixtape,  House of Balloons , was like the woozy soundtrack to an endless, libidinous loop of willful couch crashing. If it seemed like there wasn’t always confidence behind his debaucherous asides — his bruised tenor favored stops and starts, brutal fits and murmurs, run-on rants — that likely was intentional, part of his overall brilliance. It was almost like he was trying to steel himself for a night of very bad decisions he was about to make over and over again. Since his big-leagues level-up, though,  The Weeknd  has struggled to maintain some of that brooding authenticity. Fans of his infamous 2012  Trilogy  compilation relished in the decadence of their antihero, who sang like he’d slept under the coolest bridge in some seedy city where the predominant existential questions were always, “Wait, where am I? What are we even doing?” Conversely, 2016’s  Starboy , for all its blissful highs, began to feel like one bloated, never-ending fashion week runway. Thankfully, on his fifth album,  Dawn FM , the Weeknd focuses those interstellar ambitions to anoint us with the most enchanting music to the portal through purgatory.   We love our artists fucked up, frankly. There’s something in the deep recesses of self-induced suffering that seems to bring out the best in them. But it’s all fun and games until they wind up a walking self-help aisle. The 16 songs on  Dawn FM  don’t grapple with the idea of addiction in the way we’ve come to expect from him (none of the addled “glass-table girls” of last decade’s demon time), and infidelities amount to wistful moments of vulnerability as opposed to tortured diatribes. If there’s a self-help vibe here, it’s refreshingly light and accessible — self-help for the selfie set. On “Gasoline,” the Toronto troubadour chants, “I know you won’t let me OD,” in a tone that makes his partner sound like an enlightened seer prepared to guide him on some rustic spiritual retreat. And on “Out of Time,” there’s a touch of solace as he confesses, over shimmering, lush orchestration that recalls  Off the Wall -era Michael Jackson, “Say I love you girl, but I’m out of time/Now I can’t keep you from loving him, you made up your mind.” Jackson’s spirit is all over this project. “A Tale By Quincy” finds Quincy Jones himself, in a spoken-word interlude, waxing introspective (”Looking back is a bitch, isn’t it”?), playing right into the themes of success and self-exposure. Narrated by Jim Carrey, who serves as a benign, between-worlds radio announcer,  Dawn FM  is about boundless freedoms. Like some Casanova Kevin Finnerty, The Weeknd drifts through a surreal plane of existence on the Lil Wayne-assisted “I Heard You’re Married,” ending up with someone else’s wife. But unlike that in-limbo  Sopranos  alter-ego, the man born Abel Tesfaye is upbeat about impermanence: “Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics/And you didn’t expect to fall for me once you get the dick,” he boasts on this electro-boogie two-step staple. “Every Angel Is Terrifying” is a  Vanilla Sky -like monologue about the afterlife, whose utopian jargon (”You will enter a world beyond your imagination/A future out of control”) matches the album’s motifs, even if it ultimately slows down the momentum. But the punchy “Less Than Zero” is a sure-fire hit. Soon to be a mainstay at proms, weddings, and sweet sixteens, the soaring hook gives the co-sign to throwing caution to the wind: “‘Cause I can’t shake this feeling that’s crawling in my bed/I try to hide it but I know you know me/I try to fight it but I’d rather be free.” The Weeknd has quit his old haunts and is all the more lucid. That sense of clarity is deeply rewarding.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/weeknd-dawn-review-1278189/
2022-01-07,Mosi Reeves,3,"Gunna,Hip-Hop","Gunna’s ‘DS4EVER’ is Flashy, Intoxicating, and a Little Cliched","On  DS4EVER,  Gunna  brings a surfeit of personal style. His raps, a blend of melodic gestures and whispered boasts, glide like an Aston Martin dashing along Biscayne Bay. It’s breezy and full of allusions to hot sex, macho boasts and luxury accoutrements. On occasion, he refers to personal troubles: The Turbo-produced “Livin’ Wild” finds him admitting, “I just got from the hospital, might need another liver/Kidney failure, I tell ya, this shit couldn’t be no realer.” Yet the turmoil never overwhelms  Gunna ’s seductive vocal presence. Days before  DS4EVER ’s release,  Freddie Gibbs claimed  that Gunna appeared on the now-defunct TV series  Crime Stoppers  and called him a “snitch.” As far as rap battles go, it ain’t much. The kayfabe factor in  hip-hop  runs deep, and one can’t be sure if the two Warner Bros. acts aren’t simply indulging in a social-media dustup to stoke sales. (Gunna is signed to Young Thug’s Young Stoner Life imprint and 300 Entertainment, with distribution by WMG.) On “Poochie Gown,” Gunna responds by growling, “I can’t fuck with Feddie [sic] Gibbs/Niggas tellin’ fibs.” It’s the equivalent of a shoulder shrug. He knows his audience is more interested in the altered reality he conjures than petty beef. It’s a paradigm illustrated by  DS4EVER’s  cover art: a digital marble bust that hearkens to his 2018 mixtape classic with Lil Baby,  Drip Harder , yet this time the bust is clearly a visage of Gunna, clad in sunglasses and a “GUNNA” chain.   “I’m just kicking it with a baby, smoking on exotic (yes!)/Ain’t it ironic, look at me now, I used to sell narcotics,” Gunna raps and ad-libs in a singsong voice on “Private Island” as a lilting guitar is plucked over a wavy trap beat. He flips words that start with the letter “p” alongside Future and Young Thug – pussy, pills, paranoid, Porsche – on the fanciful “Pushing P,” then drops more “p” words like “penthouse” and “piped down” on “Poochie Gown.” Young Thug cheerily claims that he’s “fucking a bitch on the couch, we fuckin’ all over the house” on “Mop” before offering to take his conquest to St. Tropez. But this vision of sun, drugs and hardcore sex is for dick-swinging thugs only. On the Mike Will Made It-produced “Thought I Was Playing,” Gunna calls, “These boys a bunch of pussies/They no different than a trend.” Near the track’s end, 21 Savage lands a few dazzling, gun-toting bows and ad-libs for good measure: “Never tucked my tail, I went to war with real killers (pussy)/I’m your wifey’s surgeon, dog, I give her lip fillers (pussy).” Then there’s “P Power,” a collaboration with Drake that appeared on early press editions of  DS4Ever  yet doesn’t appear on the official streaming version. Originally nestled between “Thought I Was Playing” and “How You Did That” as the album’s sixth track, “P Power” has a filtered disco-sounding sample and the sounds of a woman moaning ecstatically, “Come into my life!” Musically, it was the most impressive thing on the project, with Gunna unfurling his horniest rhymes. Meanwhile, Drake initially sticks to the theme, offering “When you fuck on me it feels personal, baby,” before segueing into a typical complaint about why people don’t pay more attention to him, asking, “How can I not be the top of discussion?” There was nothing else on the album that sounded like it. Maybe it’ll leak onto YouTube and/or appear on the inevitable  DS4EVER (Deluxe Edition) .   While Gunna’s 2020 album  Wunna  crested with a uniform gauziness,  DS4  opts for modest sonic diversity, flitting between digitized trap hammers like “25k Jacket” and “Alotta Cake”; and laconic, guitar-inflected oases like “Livin Wild” and “Flooded.” Quality features abound, from 21 Savage on the aforementioned “Thought I Was Playing” to G Herbo swinging hard on “IDK That Bitch.” Its most audacious moment finds him and Chloe Bailey harmonizing the chorus from Jon B’s “They Don’t Know” on “You & Me.” It’s amusing, albeit a little gimmicky.  Every Southern rapper  these days seems to think that he could be a 90s R&B lothario if given the chance. Gunna has a flashy and intoxicating vocal style, and that alone  DS4  a worthy escapade. But he can’t transcend the clichés that define his era.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/gunna-ds4ever-review-1280940/
2022-01-13,Julyssa Lopez,4,,FKA Twigs’ ‘Caprisongs’ Is an Unbridled Thrill,"Magdalene,  the 2019 album by British-pop polymath FKA Twigs ,  was as exquisite as it was excruciating, nearly every song writhing with the anguish she experienced after a shattering period of heartache, loneliness, and health challenges. Shortly before making the album, she had several fibroids removed from her uterus — small tumors she described as “a fruit bowl of pain” lodged in her abdomen — and went through two intensely public breakups: In 2020, she filed a lawsuit detailing the emotional, physical, and mental abuse she’d suffered when she was with a  famous Hollywood actor . Her traumas were splayed out for the world to see, and Twigs confronted such heavy turmoil by shaping  Magdalene  into a project so visceral and sacrosanct that it felt like bloodletting.   The rawness of her previous work is part of what makes the unbridled avant pop on her new mixtape,  Caprisongs,  such an epic thrill. Twigs is still excising some pain, but she’s uninhibited and out of fucks to give, choosing instead to center herself, her friends, and her joy as she finds release in sounds pulled from cavernous clubs and euphoric dance floors from London to Jamaica. Throughout her career, Twigs has morphed R&B wisps and electronic abstractions into highly visual concept art, and although the music on  Caprisongs  is her most buoyant, she doesn’t sacrifice her creative nonconformity or intimacy. She strikes a careful balance, akin to perfecting an arabesque on a razor blade, as she revels in production that’s carefree, cathartic, and completely life-giving. “It’s bronzer in the sink, alco pop on the side,” she wrote in a Twitter post announcing the project. “Friends in the park, your favourite person, that one sentence somebody said to you that changed everything.”   Twigs’ artistry is deeply physical, tied to her athleticism as a performer, so it’s not really a shock that her impulse is to sweat away any badness still lingering in her bones. “Wanna dance you out of my, gotta dance you out of my hips, my thighs, my wrongs, my rights,” she sings on “Tears in the Club,” where she’s joined by fellow pop eccentric the Weeknd. She dives into the dark dubiness of “Honda,” and gathers her girls for “Pamplemousse,” a swatch of chemical hyperpop indebted to Charli XCX and Sophie. Subtle homages to Jamaican dancehall and Afrobeats appear in the slow-wine of “Jealousy,” with Nigerian singer Rema, and “Papi Bones,” boosted by the subversive shapeshifter Shygirl. A voice toward the end of the song marvels, “She lets herself be free and so expressive and  don’t give a fuck .” Twigs edges just to the brink of the mainstream but leaps back into experimentalism before getting too close to ordinariness. She produced the mixtape alongside a few of the industry’s most freethinking heretics, including Arca and El Guincho, and ends up with a prismatic collection of tracks that reinforce her bona fides as more pop auteur than pop star. “Careless,” with Daniel Caesar, could have been a standard R&B duet if Twigs didn’t push her falsetto to the max to mix up the melody and the song’s provocations. Even as the 17-song project starts to drift in the latter half, Twigs makes meandering part of the exploratory process that still turns up refreshing streaks of freedom and inventiveness.   Caprisongs  is structured like a real mixtape, complete with the clicks of a “record” button at the beginning of each song. Audio snippets from Twigs and her friends imbue the project with a closeness and a sense of vulnerability that lingers even when she’s losing herself on the dance floor. “I want to be more confident, I really do,” she admits before “Meta Angel” bursts into little micro-choirs, made up of her layered vocals, that reflect the constant chatter she hears in her head. She offers up what’s helped her: Positive affirmations and pep talks from people close to her, are shared and distributed to anyone listening. “Fuck crying over stupid boys who don’t even recognize the worth in themselves,” someone instructs toward the end of “Oh My Love.” Twigs follows each piece of advice to ecstatic ends. Considering the dark, daunting times we’re all living through, when our worlds can feel smaller and more stifled, seeing her break loose is all the more inspiring.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/fka-twigs-caprisongs-review-1280995/
2022-01-14,Stephen Kearse,4,,Earl Sweatshirt Wrecks Rap’s Rules on ‘Sick!’,"For a certain strain of rap fan, Earl Sweatshirt’s elite lyricism has made him a god among men. But rather than coast on that deification, the California rapper (whose real name is Thebe Kgositsile) has spent his career defying expectations. His response to listeners seeking replays of his 2010 mixtape  Earl ,  which introduced him as a devilish lyrical wunderkind, has been relentless reinvention. On his first two albums, those revisions were muted, taking place mostly on the level of subject matter and sound. But on 2018’s  Some Rap Songs  and 2019’s  Feet of Clay ,  he directly pushed against notions of rap greatness as merely the sum of one’s verbiage, embracing the clipped rhythms and nonlinearity of the hip-hop margins. His elliptic, woozy songwriting, crammed with texture and motion, yet shunning structure and cogency, subverted ideas about how rap songs could sound and be arranged.  Sick!  continues that trend, charting new territory for Earl while continuing to subtly dissect rap conventions.   Sick!  came together in the aftermath of another planned album falling apart due to the pandemic and Earl’s uneasiness with his writing becoming showy and mechanical. “I was rapping, rapping, on every single song,” he said  in an interview . “The album I was working on before had a really optimistic energy towards it, but it felt gross. It felt political, like a mayoral campaign.” That hesitance,  plus planned tracks being lost  in some sort of computer snafu, seems to have pushed him toward more urgency and directness, a reset that reorients the mechanics of his songs.  On previous albums, Earl treated music as a refuge where he could probe his aching psyche and voice his darkest emotions.  Sick!  is decidedly outward facing, the rapper breaching rather than tunneling. A sense of artistic renewal guides his music as he navigates the pandemic world and its ambient horrors. The single “Titanic” is almost trolling in its breezy free associations. “Iceberg, MAC kinda slim/What they couldn’t see sink the ships/Capsize mean you’s a flip/Send a postcard from the depth,” he deadpans, zeroing in on the Titanic as a disaster parable, yet remaining wry. On “Vision,” he addresses the pandemic directly: “Everything we in the midst of/How long you waiving the rent?/Moratorium extendo/I’m just evading the pit,” he raps, his flow springing off Black Noi$e’s hypnotic piano loop. He’s constantly finding ways to play with words without trivializing them, a balance that has eluded many of rap’s preeminent lyricists in recent years. It helps that his words are more sonically foregrounded compared with past releases. The album is mixed by vaunted Jay-Z engineer Young Guru, who renders the vocals crisp and clear, and Earl, a lover of murky, waterlogged sounds, notably has no production credits. The beatmaking is instead delegated to longtime collaborators like the Alchemist, Black Noi$e, Samiyam, and Sage Elsesser (as Ancestors), all of whom provide conventional production with discernible drums and pristine samples rather than an “ Earl Sweatshirt-type beat .” Leaving behind the corroded and abrasive soundscapes of previous releases gives him space to rap “straight, no frills,” as he puts it on “Titanic.” The trick to that self-assessment, of course, is that, fittingly, it’s also a misdirection. Earl remains an oddball writer who parachutes into ideas from peculiar, oblique angles. Thematically, he focuses on forward motion, frequently adopting imagery that melds the earthen and the bodily, the cosmic and personal. “Foot shook ground when I stepped on it/I didn’t look back when I broke soil/‘Cause every time I did it would hurt more,” he raps on “2010,” one of many moments where he interrogates the past to reaffirm his commitment to the future. “Fire leaping up out the hole/Deep breathing only make it grow,” he deadpans on “Fire in the Hole,” unfazed by the flame.   Throughout the album, his lyrics evoke eruption and heat, images that cast his cryptic revelations as both painful and cleansing. “Lye,” built on a chipper horn loop, invokes the scene in  The Autobiography of Malcolm X  where X first gets his hair conked. “Sometimes the pain sit and fester in the hate, beloved/I’m working on it /It’s worth the time,” he offers, his voice eerily composed, almost relieved. On “God Laughs,” he again refers to fire in a reflective, thankful way, rapping “Operating on an empty tank spanked me/Fumes fueling the flame,” over Alexander Spit’s feathery beat. It’s dazzling how  purposefully  he can rap, avoiding filler while still sounding commanding, playful, and spry. Earl never turns  Sick!  into a polemic, but it doesn’t feel accidental that on his most legible album, he’s actively engaged in dismantling what it means for rappers to go in, and to evolve as artists. Without punchlines, hooks, eccentric beats, and flashy flows, he finds ways to astound and delight, avoiding gimmicks as well as grandstanding. As rap’s newcomers, legends, and fans spin in place, Earl Sweatshirt reminds us the genre has always thrived not on deities or empty spectacle, but on humble tools and the imaginations willing to put them to work.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/earl-sweatshirt-sick-review-1282172/
2022-01-21,Jon Dolan,3.5,"Bruce Springsteen,John Mellencamp",John Mellencamp is Compellingly Cranky on ‘Strictly a One-Eyed Jack’,"“We watch our lives just fade away,”  John Mellencamp  sings on  Strictly a One-Eyed Jack , his 25th studio album. The grim honesty of the sentiment is striking, almost as striking as the forbiddingly rugged croak of his voice, which now approaches Bob Dylan and Tom Waits territory in its rangy, weathered gravitas. At 70, Mellencamp has seen enough: “Worries occupy my brain/I worry about tomorrow/I worry about today,” he sings over the front-porch blues stomp of “I Am a Man That Worries.” The music is just as serious, a rough yet refined version of the Americana rusticity that’s been a hallmark of his sound since back when he was positing himself as the hardheaded Indiana-roots rejoinder to MTV’s slick coastal elites — a dude who flipped the bird to the flashy excess of the  Tawny   Kitaen era  by appearing on the cover of his 1987 album,   The Lonesome Jubilee ,  sitting in a small-town bar next to a stone-faced farmer who looks like he’s been parked there since the Dust Bowl. Now, Mellencamp has essentially become that guy. Life goals!   Often on  Strictly a One-Eyed Jack,  he sounds like Dylan or Waits, with their trickstery absurdism replaced by a stark Midwestern earnestness. The bracing country-rock tune “Lie to Me” lances into a world of fakes and cheaters, with obvious political overtones.  “Chasing Rainbows” is musically elegant, evoking the Band at their warmest, but lyrically unsparing in its realism: “As you walk down streets of broken dreams/Some have lost everything/While others are still looking for that easy pot of gold,” he warns, with far more contempt than pity in his voice. The verdict:  Fuck rainbows .   “Did You Say Such a Thing,” one of the three songs featuring  Bruce Springsteen , takes a strong stand against gossip.  The biggest bugaboo here is mortality. The album’s centerpiece is the anthemic Springsteen duet  “Wasted Days,”  one more reminder that life goes on long after the thrill of living is gone, with Mellencamp’s and Springsteen’s voices merging into one empathetic croak. “Gone So Soon” is an affecting detour into vintage torch-song piano balladry, the bruised tenderness in Mellencamp’s voice evoking Dylan’s take on the American Songbook.  That contrast between lyrical bleakness and musical beauty is a theme throughout the album. On the most movingly lovely song, “Driving in the Rain,” fiddles drone gorgeously over a gentle country lope as Mellencamp amiably growls “And the days scurry by so fast/I finally see myself and laugh, noticing the change,” a little like Louis Armstrong fronting Son Volt. He ends the album with another “rain” song and another Springsteen appearance, “A Life Full of Rain,” turning Bruce-size grandeur inside out with grizzly guitar chaos and lyrics about disappearing into solitude and cursing your mother for the day you were born. Heavy stuff. But in rushing to get over the business of shirking off this pain-in-the-ass mortal coil, Mellencamp has made an urgent-feeling, musically rich record, one of his most memorable in a while. Whether life has much left to give him is his call to make, but he still has plenty to offer us.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/john-mellencamp-strictly-a-one-eyed-jack-review-bruce-springsteen-1287931/
2022-01-24,Lucas Villa,3.5,,Christina Aguilera Successfully Embraces Her Roots on ‘La Fuerza’,"“I’ve never stopped being an Aguilera no matter what happens or what’s hot or trending,” Christina said in a recent interview about her new EP,  La Fuerza . The pop icon embraces her Ecuadorian roots on her first major Latin release in more than two decades. The EP’s title translates to “The Strength,” which Aguilera flexes with her powerhouse vocals across six new songs that span pop, ranchera, and reggaetón music influences. Aguilera made her debut in the Latin market in 2000, with  Mi Reflejo , which included Spanish translations of her hits from her debut album alongside a few covers and original songs. In the years that followed, Aguilera intermittently dropped songs in Spanish, including the  Bionic  standout “Desnudate,” and the breathtaking “Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti” with Mexican crooner Alejandro Fernández.   Aguilera returned to Miami, where she recorded  Mi Reflejo  as a teen, to work on  La Fuerza . Now, as a 41-year-old woman, she shares the spotlight with the next generation of Latina acts on the mighty “ Pa Mis Muchachas .” Aguilera is joined by Chicana pop star Becky G and Argentine artists Nathy Peluso and Nicki Nicole. Backed by Cuban guaracha with a twist of trap beats, Aguilera fiercely leads the flirty Latina empowerment anthem.   The ballads are another highlight of  La Fuerza,  where Aguilera’s powerful vocals soar. In the piano-led “ Somos Nada ,” Aguilera weathers the elements and heartbreak to find her inner strength to move on. The fittingly titled “ La Reina ” is the best song on the EP; on it, Aguilera issues a response to the king of ranchera music   Vicente Fernández ‘s “El Rey.” With the raw emotion that underscores ranchera, Aguilera belts in Spanish, “Although you are still king, you’re nothing without the queen.” Her vocal prowess is extraordinary in any language.   Aguilera dabbles in reggaetón alongside Puerto Rican superstar Ozuna in the sexy “ Santo, ” proving she’s still  dirrty  as she pleads with the saints to save her from a life of eternal  perreando ( a.k.a.  twerking ) . “ Ya Llegué ” is another alluring romp, on which Aguilera evokes “Genio Atrapado,” the Spanish version of “Genie in a Bottle.” Out of the reggaetón songs, only “ Como Yo ” feels underwhelming and dated. It’s a shame for filler to exist on this already short EP.  La Fuerza  is the “first chapter” of three Spanish EPs that Aguilera will release throughout the year. It’s a good first effort, but working within the sonically expansive and culturally rich Latin music scene, hopefully there’s more variety on the next installments.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/christina-aguilera-la-fuerza-1289611/
2022-01-28,Stephen Kearse,3,,Amber Mark Gets Lost in the Stars on ‘Three Dimensions Deep’,"New York R&B singer and producer Amber Mark made her debut in 2017 with  3:33AM , a movingly grief-stricken ode to her dead mother. It was a strikingly personal statement for a first release, and during the recording of her second EP, the bossa-nova-influenced  Conexão , she struggled to match its emotional heft. “I was just throwing songs away because they weren’t deep enough or good enough,” she said in an  interview  at the time.  On her first full-length,  Three Dimensions Deep,  Mark searches for a way out of her slump, adopting a looser approach to songwriting that prioritizes mood and style as much as sentiment, and emphasizes her versatility as a vocalist. She often sounds invigorated as the record breezes through multiple styles of R&B as well as afropop, house, and funk.   Mark has credited a songwriting camp held by One Direction producer Julian Bunetta with helping her expand her palette. Playing songwriting games with Bunetta and other artists further relieved the pressure to make diaristic songs, a freedom that sustained her as the pandemic derailed the initial release date for her album in 2020. She released over a dozen singles in the lead-up to  Three Dimensions Deep , most memorably a soulful cover of Nirvana’s “Heart-Shaped Box” and a lush rendition of Sisqó’s “Thong Song.” Most of those loosies are left off the album, but the record retains that sense of exploration and play.    The title refers to the limits of human perception, a theme Mark uses to narrate a new-age journey of self-revelation.  Three Dimensions Deep  begins with a prayer of sorts. “One” finds the singer plagued by anxiety and doubt, pleading to the sky for guidance. “And I don’t know if I’ll ever succeed/I just want you proud of me up above,” she sings over warm harmonies and a tinny soul sample flecked with horns. Grief still colors her writing, but it’s more open-ended, the firmament embodying hope as well as pain. Mark spends much of the concept album stargazing in this way, her lyrics frequently drawing from celestial imagery, astrophysics, and science fiction in service of making sense of her world.  Initially, this interest in the cosmos is subtext, adding a spiritual element to the the album’s tales of romance and isolation. The disco-tinged “What It Is” presents love as a sublime state that defies comprehension and dissolves boundaries, Mark’s harmonies and melodies coalescing as she loses herself in the rapture of passion. When a breakup causes her to crash land, her awareness of her body and personal space sharpens. “I know my body better/The curves and lines,” she sings on breathy kiss-off “Turning Pages.” On “Healing Hurts,” she cleverly evokes the false comfort of deleting all traces of an ex: “Out my phone/But you’re still inside this heart you broke.” In these moments, space is modular and relational, defined by proximity and distance, tension and strain. Unfortunately, her shapeshifting gets short-circuited by hamfisted writing, especially as the album’s space theme gets less playful and more literal. The first half of the record is a romp, Mark swinging from ballads (“Most Men”) to hip house (“FOMO) to retro funk (“Foreign Things”). But past the midway point, it slinks into a suite of cosmic clunkers, her astronomical metaphors growing one-dimensional and forced as she sings over frictionless, ethereal beats.  “Darkside,” a bland Prince pastiche, is the album’s nadir. “Your vibrations got me shaking/Big Bang-making type of high/Your astronomical kiss/Constellations shoot sensations through me to the sky,” Mark sings. Impressively, it gets worse. “But then the force is strong when I’m skywalking by your solar system,” she says later in the song, a line that would make even George Lucas blush. The album does circle back to Earth, and the dance floor, for its final stretch. But it closes with “Event Horizon,” another return to the parched well of cosmic imagery. It’s a disappointment because the thrill of cosmic R&B is the way it folds space, forging connections between the mundane and the empyrean, the flesh and the spirit. Mark’s universe, by contrast, just feels empty.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/amber-mark-three-dimensions-deep-1289880/
2022-01-28,David Browne,4,"Soundtrack,Summer of Soul",The ‘Summer of Soul’ Soundtrack Is Just as Revelatory as the Movie,"A few tracks into the  soundtrack  of Questlove’s music-fest documentary, an emcee introduces the next performer, David Ruffin. A year after being bounced out of the Temptations, the notoriously troubled Ruffin already sounds nostalgic: “I’d like to go back to the  olden  days,” he says, with a glimmer of humor, as his backup band starts into the Temps’ “My Girl.” Only five years had passed since that hit had conquered the world, but as Ruffin himself may have gleaned, Black music had grown exponentially in that short time. And both the  Summer of Soul  movie and its accompanying album (which revives the tradition of live festival albums of that era, from  Woodstock  to  Wattstax ) are reminders of the ways in which soul and R&B had expanded and run wild in the period leading up to the Harlem Cultural Festival in the summer of 1969.   Those changes are doubly clear on the album, on which we’re able to experience complete performances of songs only heard in snippets in the movie. Heard in full, both B.B. King’s “Why I Sing the Blues” and the Chambers Brothers’ “Uptown” are even friskier and more propulsive than on studio versions; the coming funk revolution can’t be denied. The impact of the civil rights moment on music also emerges in Nina Simone’s “Backlash Blues” and “Are You Ready,” and the Staple Singers’ “It’s Been a Change.” Whether the performances are stark and embittered (Simone’s) or somber and haunted (the Staples’), the tracks communicate years of struggle  and pain — a far cry from the sense of hope that ran through earlier calls to arms, like Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come.”   Sly and the Family Stones’ two tracks — a bustling “Sing a Simple Song” and the multivoiced glory of “Everyday People” — zero in on the way Black music was absorbing funk and rock as the decade came to a close. Neither cut is as volcanic as the band’s multisong medley at Woodstock, but the paucity of officially released Family Stone live recordings makes them valuable documents. It’s impossible to hear the roof-wrecking horns and Sly rave-ups on the former without thinking anew of his impact on Prince. The soundtrack (and the movie) also make the point that the Harlem Cultural Festival wasn’t strictly about soul. Two of the pleasures of the album are Mongo Santamaria’s Latin-jazz strut “Watermelon Man” — originally a hit for its writer, Herbie Hancock — and jazz flutist Herbie Mann’s “Hold On, I’m Comin’.” Thank God for the latter, since finally we get to hear guitarist Sonny Sharrock’s sputtery free-jazz solo halfway through that Sam and Dave cover. And in a sign of how timeless these songs can be given the state of the country in 2022, percussionist and bandleader Ray Barretto’s “Together” is a plea for those of all races and beliefs to come together — “before it’s too goddamn late!” as Barretto asserts, prophetically. As for David Ruffin, his solo “My Girl” doesn’t come close to replicating the heavenly glide of the Temptations’ version, especially when a horn section replaces his ex-bandmates’ harmonies. Ruffin’s voice is already roughed up, hinting at the coming train wreck of his life and career. But he still whoops it up and, at one point, holds a falsetto note for 15 astonishing seconds. Even as soul was moving forward that summer, its luminous past could still take center stage from time to time.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/summer-of-soul-soundtrack-review-1288715/
2022-01-31,Will Dukes,3.5,,PinkPantheress Has Refurbished Her Killer Debut Mixtape With a New Set of Remixes,"The U.K.’s PinkPantheress broke onto the scene last January with “Pain,” a trendy, trailer-short song about rejection that feels as epic as a full-on teen melodrama. Though it’s an aural sad-face emoji, the viral sensation, with its playful, chantlike refrains is all about keeping your cool, which is likely why it resonated with the generation that thinks posting the wrong meme is a minor catastrophe. If the Zoomer pop world is  Mean Girls ,  PinkPantheress is at the table with all the stoners and burnouts, fashioning whole hashtag-friendly flips of the human condition from her laptop. A year later, the social media star adds some new dimensions to her mercurial moods, teaming up with renowned producers like LSDXOXO, WondaGurl, and Sam Gellaitry. Youthful anxiety gets a facelift on  To Hell With It: The Remixes ,  which acts as an upbeat repurposing of all the favorites from her acclaimed 2021 mixtape.   “Pain” is refurbished by Canadian producer Powfu, who adds some wistful lines (”Could’ve done it all girl, you had me/I don’t wanna be with you if you’re not happy”) that feel like a hopeful rebuttal to PinkPanthress’s retelling of a missed encounter. And Tommy Gold’s remix of “I Must Apologise” turns regret into a spirited rollick, with zealous percussion and hypnotic woodwinds. The 20-year-old’s coy “Is it something I said?” concerns are all but vanquished by the song’s electric pulse.   There’s an airy yet earthy quality to PinkPanthress’s register, with a faint trace of the proper, rounded vowels of her native Britain. She puts it to expressive use on the WondaGurl remix of “Last Valentines,” where dreamy synths — invoking impossible sunsets, like some endless summer in February — arouse her longing. No candy hearts for her this winter. So instead she opts, resourcefully, to “count the stars tonight.” Though Flume’s revisit of “Notice I Cried”— all stagnant chords compared with the original’s explosive drum-and-bass thump — doesn’t add much, the Jarreau Vandal remix of “Reason” is a bass-heavy bop that makes the former TikTok star’s incipient musings (“And I was broken, but a little part of me thinks that I’m glad”) come off like a worry-free  Wonder Years . There’s a chill, trancelike vibe to El Guincho’s reworking of “Just for Me,” and “All My Friends Know” is revivified by producer Anz’s teeming electro throb. On the latter, PinkPanthress sounds assured as she sends some old flame to an eternal f-boy island: “Now we’re living worlds apart/Now I’ve blocked you since I’m smart.” Her damnation still sounds heavenly.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/pinkpantheress-remixes-1292750/
2021-11-23,Brenna Ehrlich,3.5,David Bowie,David Bowie’s Lost Album ‘Toy’ Is Not a Message in a Bottle — But a Bittersweet Footnote,"When  David Bowie  died on Jan. 10, 2016, the tragedy was alleviated to a degree because he’d just released one of his greatest records.  Blackstar , which came out just two days before — on Bowie’s birthday — was a glimpse into the genius mind of an artist who knew his days are numbered. Solemn, deliciously jarring, and endlessly surprising, the album put a period on a life rife with innovation, imagination, and an innate inability to stagnate. If  Blackstar  was the brilliant ending chapter in Bowie’s story, then the new release of Bowie’s famous “lost album,” 2000’s  Toy , is a kind of footnote. Those looking for some sort of revelatory message in a bottle will be disappointed by what is essentially a completely serviceable album, while Bowie fanatics will be happy to visit for a while with an old friend. The record, which was only leaked in the past, is out Friday as part of the latest Bowie box set,  David Bowie 5. Brilliant Adventure (1992 – 2001) .   Toy  was a bit of a trip down memory lane for Bowie himself; it features reworks of his earliest songs from the Sixties — before he became the rock & roll chameleon we know and love — recorded rather spontaneously after his band played Glastonbury in the summer of 2000. “I’ve pulled together a selection of songs from a somewhat unusual reservoir and booked time in a studio,”  he wrote to fans at the time . “I still get really elated by the spontaneous event and cannot wait to sit in a claustrophobic space with seven other energetic people and sing till my tits drop off.”   Listening to  Toy , it’s clear Bowie is having an absolute blast, breathing new life into bits and bobs of his catalogue only really known by diehards. Shadows of his discography flit through the record; opening rocker “I Dig Everything,” originally written in 1966, has shades of his 1973 cover of Them’s “Here Comes the Night,” while his reworking of 1967 crooner “Silly Boy Blue” calls back (probably unintentionally) to the 1986  Labyrinth  theme “Underground.” Still, it’s not all that surprising that the record was shelved. Despite the joy evident in every note of the album, it’s far from transcendent — especially coming from a musician who refused to stay in one lane. It’s a record one might expect from an artist on the precipice of settling down — and that makes sense since Bowie was indeed at a crossroads at that point in his career. He was trying to figure out how to fit into the modern music landscape — which he did, as he continued to innovate on 2002’s  Heathen  and 2013’s  The Next Day , which marked his first record in 10 years at that time and reassured fans he was never going to become a moldering icon. And then there was  Blackstar … timely and timeless and fresher than anything his contemporaries had on offer. So, yes, there’s nothing surprising about  Toy , and that’s OK. Footnotes have their purpose and so does this album — it’s supplemental material, a sidenote, a wandering walk off the main path with a friend we’ve been missing.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/david-bowie-toy-review-1260968/
2021-11-24,Gary Suarez,4,,Anuel AA Takes a Well-Earned Victory Lap on ‘Las Leyendas Nunca Mueren’,"Since the earliest days of hip-hop supremacy, rappers have likened themselves to legends–whether on the mic, in the streets, or even between the sheets. Braggadocio has always been part of Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA’s modus operandi, from his earliest underground recordings right up to today. Now he sells out sports arenas and cultivates lucrative brand partnerships, making good on those outsize boasts.  With  Las Leyendas Nunca Mueren , his third solo album and first since the less-than-godlike Ozuna team-up  Los Dioses , Anuel turns to another field where self-reliant boldness pays out big: sports. From the recognizable cover art recreation of Kobe Bryant’s NBA trophy slouch to the snippets of Mike Tyson’s notorious Lennox Lewis taunt on “Mi Voz Cuesta Un Billión,” he draws a dotted line between these champions and himself. Reinforced by rugged cuts like “Rick Flair” and “Mcgregor,” the influence of all-star athletes pervades the album, a super-sized expression of rap’s well-established love affair with sporting success.   Any iconic artist with a discography worth discussing inevitably goes through changes that impact their music, for better or for worse. The foreseeable downfall of erstwhile associate Tekashi 6ix9ine and a high-profile breakup with superstar fiancé Karol G—with both of whom the Puerto Rican trap king notably shares some of his biggest hits—are precisely the kind of public-facing events that conjure consequences concurrently personal and professional in nature. He’s weathered worse, certainly, having spent time incarcerated on federal weapons charges just as the mainstream began to take heed of the Latin trap movement he arguably led.  After making an internationally-known name for himself in reggaetón and pop-at-large alongside people with whom he  no longer  can rely upon, Anuel assuredly faced the competing temptations of a reinvention or a return-to-form.  Las Leyendas Nunca Mueren  largely and gratifyingly leans towards the latter, with the opening probation-ending tirade of “Real Hasta La Muerte” setting the tone for much of what follows. He’s swaggeringly and cocksure on “Leyenda” and holds his own next to the hungry rising star Eladio Carrión on the early standout “North Carolina.” Even with this rekindling of his O.G. trapero flame, Anuel doesn’t turn his back on the reggaetón and Spanish-language pop lovers who came to party with the guy behind “China” and “Secreto.” While not exactly prime time perreo, singles “Dictadura” and “Subelo,” with Myke Towers and Jhay Cortez, balance romantic subterfuge and trap luxury with the dancefloor in mind, more so than just about anything off last year’s commercially-minded  Emmanuel.  He takes that aesthetic to clubby extremes on the thumping “Llorando En Un Ferrari,” a lifestyle snapshot that is as revealing as it is irresistible. Reversing course on the tempo but revving up the emotional honesty, “Pin” finds Anuel sharing more of himself than ever expected, showcasing a maturity that helps make  Las Leyendas Nunca Mueren  his best album to date. Throw in the Bad Bunny easter egg at the end, and you’ve got something that lives up Anuel AA’s legendary sense of himself.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/review-annuel-aas-las-leyendas-nunca-mueren-1262502/
2021-11-24,Kory Grow,3.5,Aerosmith,"Aerosmith Are Still Dreaming on Archival Release, ‘1971: The Road Starts Hear’","Before Steven Tyler and Joe Perry became the “Toxic Twins,” they were merely intoxicated. On a newly unearthed demo tape, which is coming out with the regrettably punny title  The Road Starts Hear , that  Aerosmith  cut in 1971 — two years before releasing their self-titled debut — the band sounds loose and lubricated on embryonic versions of “Dream On,” “Mama Kin,” and other ditties they would be performing live for the next 50 years. It’s at once both a sonogram of the band as journeymen and a testament to the vision they had early on, the dogged determination to dream until the dream comes true — even if it sounds anything but dreamy in the moment. The band members were all in their late teens or early twenties when they first came together in 1970. Originally, Tyler had corralled Perry, bassist Tom Hamilton, and drummer Joey Kramer into backing him on an audition tape for the Jeff Beck Group, which had recently parted ways with Rod Stewart. They ultimately figured they made a pretty good racket of their own together, nicked a moniker from Sinclair Lewis’ novel,  Arrowsmith , and embarked upon becoming Boston’s greatest bar band. It’s that Aerosmith that plays on  1971: The Road Starts Hear , a recording that reveals their roots better than their debut LP.   Although Tyler’s pouty lips would earn the band Stones comparisons for most of its career, this record suggests the band was more obsessed with Beck, the Yardbirds, and Led Zeppelin, artists who came to prominence in the wake of the Stones’ blues-rock renaissance, making Aerosmith third-wave contributors (and giving them the latitude to create their own iconic sound eventually). On this tape, you can hear the carefree spirit in Aerosmith that would later influence bands like Mötley Crüe and Guns N’ Roses but none of the glossy, powerhouse pop sheen that would define “Kiss my sassafras”/”Love in an Elevator”-era Aerosmith in their comeback years. This is crude Aerosmith, the unrefined essence of what they would become. After years in storage, the ancient tape’s sound is murky and blurry, which actually adds to the songs’ smoky, bluesy appeal. From the beginning, when the band members sound like they’re having a Marvin Gaye “What’s Going On”-style party as Perry noodles on Fleetwood Mac’s “Albatross,” before they all align on  Aerosmith’s  “Somebody,” they sound more casual than they ever did on any studio recording. This tape is most likely a rehearsal tape, so they sound off their guard. In the release’s liner notes, penned by  Rolling Stone  contributing editor David Fricke, the band members say they can’t even remember making this recording; it was just in a stack of tapes Tyler had asked a friend to store. But it shows the chemistry they had at the time, for better and worse. Most of the material here would become middling deep cuts on the band’s early records, and the album versions almost always sound better, thanks to recording-studio sound which allows you to hear both Perry and rhythm guitarist Brad Whitford’s parts clearly in stereo. On every song here, Tyler sings in the kind of strange Kermit the Frog voice he used on the first album, before he embraced his James Browny rasp. And some of the songs, which were likely recorded only for the band, sound downright sloppy. On “Dream On,” the piano sounds out of tune, Perry flubs a few notes, and Tyler sounds like he’s gasping for oxygen on the high notes. But on the upside, the song features a long-forgotten outro for the song; where the studio single ends like the  Twilight Zone  theme, Perry and Whitford play an almost cheerful guitar line, giving it some historical importance. It just doesn’t live up to their later legend.   The best stuff here, though, comes when the musicians just kick into bar-rock mode. Their cover of Rufus Thomas’ blues number “Walkin’ the Dog” sounds rowdy and dangerous; even with Tyler’s flute solo, it sounds more like the party anthem it probably was before they professionalized it in the studio for  Aerosmith . “Movin’ Out” (the first song with a Tyler-Perry songwriting credit to make it on an album) reeks of  Led Zeppelin III  patchouli with its psychedelic guitars and Kramer’s thumping drumbeat; the album version is boring by comparison with its weird phaser effect on Tyler’s voice and tighter playing. Both “Somebody” and “Mama Kin” (two songs that sound almost exactly alike, except in that “Mama Kin” is better) show how Aerosmith were born with their signature groove intact. They likely learned that groove from messing around on blues songs like the release’s two blues rarities, “Reefer Headed Woman” and “Major Barbra.” It’s a feeling they’d later lose their grasp on. By the time they recorded “Reefer” for  Night in the Ruts , they sounded more jaded and like they were going through the motions (this time with heavy-metal guitar distortion). As for “Major Barbra,” they quickly abandoned it, sticking versions of it on their  Classics Live  and  Pandora’s Box  comps; it’s a shame that the version here doesn’t sound better because it’s a better performance than either of the official releases. But because you can practically hear the dust infecting the tape heads,  The Road Starts Hear  feels more like a curious fossil, worthy of study, rather than a lost gem. This is not Aerosmith; this is the promise of Aerosmith. It’s rude awakenings, not the dream come true.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/aerosmith-1971-road-starts-hear-review-1261908/
2021-12-03,Will Dukes,3.5,Tierra Whack,Tierra Whack’s New 3-Song EP ‘Rap?’ Is a Distillation of Her Competitive Spirit,"Tierra Whack  rhymes like she’s a Mensa member from around the way, with a knack for turning each bar into a veritable game of the dozens. No surprise, seeing that the 26-year-old, who went to an arts academy, made her bones battling on North Philly blocks. Her new EP,  Rap?  is a succinct distillation of Tierra Whack’s hypercompetitive spirit, enriched by some smart, introspective gems. On opener “Stand Up” she gets right to the point with some harsh barbs lobbed at any would-be contenders: “You are not thorough, you’re plastic/I am not the queen? Sarcastic.” Tierra’s flow here — bolstered by piercing bass tones — borrows from the same old-school pocket as Missy Elliot’s 2005 deep cut “On & On,” which itself invokes Roxanne Shante’s 1987 single “Have a Nice Day.” So Tierra signals upfront that she’s part of a deep and fabled legacy.   She’s still very much writing her own story, though, as evidenced by the heartfelt narrative “Megan Good.” In under three minutes, the rapper formerly named Dizzle Dizz recites an Emmy-worthy, Lifetime movie of a memoir, reminiscing on the days when “we had nothin’ and had dreams of gettin’ money.”   Of course, with projects like her 2018 debut,  Whack World , Tierra helped usher in the under-one-minute song format, which is still shaking up the industry, changing our perceptions of what an album even is in the app-only era. And while this brief, impressive project contains longer songs — the only regret is it’s not even longer — it still suggests Tierra’s loyalty to the “less is more” rule. “Millions” is an upbeat case study on what it means to be grateful. It also boasts some artful snark for good measure. Over J. Melodic’s piano-driven soul wheeze, Tierra brags, “Tape been done, all play, no skips/Walk-in closet, I could do three flips/I’ma do ’em nasty like sugar and grits.” This smart MC is also a smartass.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/tierra-whacks-new-3-song-ep-rap-is-a-distillation-of-her-competitive-spirit-1266310/
2021-12-08,David Browne,3.5,"album review,Crazy Horse,Neil Young,Neil Young and Crazy Horse","Neil Young and Crazy Horse Are Back, Thunderous and Ornery on ‘Barn’","In the last decade or two, you generally know what’s coming when you hit play on a new  Neil Young  record. You know there will be a few sweet lovestruck hymns that sound as if they’re being played in dusty Old West saloons or around campfires. You anticipate the songs that wax nostalgic about his childhood, and the ones that rage against the destructiveness and stupidity of mankind and the impact on the planet. You await those moments when he turns the volume knob up and makes his guitar sound like it’s sandblasting paint off an old shed All those elements are in play in  Barn , but the crucial difference is the presence of a reconstituted version of  Crazy Horse , with recurring Young sideman Nils Lofgren replacing the retired Frank “Poncho” Sampedro. Young first reconvened his on-again, dismissed-again band for 2010’s underwhelming  Colorado , but maybe they all just needed time to warm up. On  Barn , cut in just a few days at a log-cabin structure in Colorado, the thunderous and ornery side of Young and the Horse revs up again, and sonically, at least, it’s akin to running into an old friend you haven’t seen face to face since the pre-pandemic days.   Take, for instance, “Heading West.” One of those look-backs at his youth and his parents’ breakup, it’s not nearly as detailed or fleshed out as previous narratives from “Don’t Be Denied” to “Born in Ontario.” But with his electric leading the way, the music is cranky and clankety, and drummer Ralph Molina can still hit his kit hard. “Canamerican,” where Young revels in his newfound ability to vote in this country (and for Joe Biden), and “Change Ain’t Never Gonna,” one of his apocalyptic rants, also summon up the old Horse rumble, down to those spooky, ethereal harmonies by Molina and bassist Billy Talbot. Likewise, “Welcome Back” has a muted, slithering beauty, like an older, more somber “Cortez the Killer,” and “They Might Be Lost,” with another narrator awaiting the arrival of something foreboding, plays like a lyrical older companion to “Powderfinger.” Young’s softer, more maudlin side rolls out in “Song of the Seasons” and “Tumblin’ Through the Years,” the inevitable paeans to his wife Daryl Hannah and their new life together, and damn if Young’s voice, especially its upper register, hasn’t aged shockingly well. The rollicking “The Shape of You”–no, not a cover of the Ed Sheeran song–is awfully goofy, but that falsetto in the chorus is the sound of someone in love and unafraid to embarrass himself in public while expressing it. At times, you miss the splatter of Poncho’s rhythm guitar, and you also wish Young had taken another shot at his lyrics, which can feel a little cringy and first draft (“Before your computer turns on you/And walking through the garden/You remember something you’ve been through/And mingle with the stars in the sky”). But even more so than on  Colorado , Lofgren’s contributions and his musical interplay with Young—his jabbing guitar on “Change Ain’t Never Gonna,” piano parts here and there–recall what he also brought to  Tonight’s the Night.  The deluxe edition of  Barn  includes an hour-plus documentary about the making of the album (also available as a separate Blu Ray). Directed by Hannah, credited as “dhlovelife,” it’s almost like a webcam: We see the four men wander in and out of the barn, tune up their instruments, turn Young’s request for cold beer into a vocal warmup exercise, play the songs, make small talk between takes, and celebrate Talbot’s 76th birthday with cake and candles. It’s  Get Back  without people walking out in frustration or mentioning Eric Clapton. You’re struck by how up there in their years they all look —  Young himself turned 76 last month. But in light of how many of Young’s peers are retiring, no longer writing new songs or, alas,  dying , seeing and hearing these weathered veterans summon up some of that old power is about as reassuring as heritage rock gets in 2021. And yes, it almost makes you say: More barn.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/neil-young-and-crazy-horse-more-barn-1266713/
2021-12-10,Tim Chan,3.5,"K-Pop,MONSTA X",Monsta X Deliver Boy-Band Polish With Heart on ‘The Dreaming’,"Much has been said about  K-pop  borrowing liberally from American hip-hop culture, but on their second English-language album,  The Dreaming , K-pop group  Monsta X  pays homage to boy-band culture, with Nineties-style harmonies, slick choruses, and head-bopping beats that come together for an infectious and joyous 27 minutes. Recorded while Covid still kept much of the world on edge,  The Dreaming  is an ode to simpler times, with Shownu, Minhyuk, Kihyun, Hyungwon, Jooheon, and I.M. belting out lyrics about falling in love — and yearning for their feelings to be reciprocated. “Don’t make me beg, don’t walk away,” they plead on the disco-funk track “Better,” which wouldn’t sound out of place on a Jonas Brothers record. “I need you ’cause I know I’ll never get any better.” They’re even more direct on the acoustic-driven “Tied to Your Body,” which loops a groovy guitar riff over a syncopated chorus performed in near-perfect falsetto. “Everyday I’m a little more obsessed, I’m a little more attached, you know that you got me just a little more tied to your body,” they sing.   While Monsta X’s first all-English album, 2020’s  All About Luv,  drew heavily from dance pop and R&B,  The Dreaming  showcases the group’s versatility, mixing synth beats and EDM with indie pop, rock, and even traces of New Jack Swing. On some tracks, like the adventurous “About Last Night,” the group switches genres within the same song, starting with a folky, Edward Sharpe-style verse before exploding into a wild, pulsating chorus backed by big techno beats. The six members have never sounded more confident either, a likely result of feeling more comfortable singing in English and also the vocal training they put in during quarantine, which is evident in the way their voices effortlessly glide through the complex harmonies and melodic shifts on the record. (Note: While group leader Shownu is currently enlisted in the army as part of South Korea’s mandatory military service, he still appears on the album.) The Dreaming  features contributions from songwriters like David Stewart (BTS, Jonas Brothers), Teddy Geiger (Shawn Mendes, Lizzo), and John Ryan (Harry Styles, Maroon 5). And while some of the lyrics would sound cheesy or overly saccharine if sung by other artists, they work for Monsta X in large part because of the group’s sincerity — you can’t help but believe what they’re singing. It isn’t just on the love songs either; these guys aren’t afraid to get vulnerable when it comes to exposing a two-timing partner on the midtempo “Whispers in the Dark,” which rides an Eighties-style beat with lines like “Lying through your teeth while you’re lying next to me.” All About Luv  proved Monsta X weren’t afraid to get freaky either (go listen to the terrific “Misbehave”), and  The Dreaming  continues to move in a more mature direction, with numerous references to getting “naked on the floor” (“You Problem”) and “getting it on” (“Blow Your Mind”). The overtly sexual lyrics don’t always work, but only because the members’ voices are so pure and polished; here’s hoping they loosen up a bit so they can really get down and dirty for album three. Everything comes together much better on the gorgeous lead single, “One Day,” which has become one of the few K-pop songs to break into the Top 40 charts. A tender ballad about fate and love, “One Day” eschews the heavy-handed production and tired metaphors that bog down some parts of the album in favor of a simple melody, earnest lyrics, and a soaring chorus you’ll be humming back after one listen. Like the boy bands that came before them, Monsta X prove you don’t have to be the loudest or coolest act in the room to win over an audience — a little bit of heart gets you a lot of love back.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/monsta-x-the-dreaming-album-review-1267246/
2021-12-10,Jon Dolan,3.5,"Alicia Keys,Mike WiLL Made It",Alicia Keys Delivers a Huge Album Without a Huge Ego,"2021 has seen its share of albums in which major artists meet huge expectations with supersize tracklists — records like Drake’s 86-minute  Certified Lover Boy  and Kanye West’s punishingly enormous  Donda . Now you can add  Alicia Keys  to the list of A-list epic-makers.  Keys , her eighth album, is a 26-song double-LP. But Alicia has never been one for self-indulgence, so she’s neatly divvied the project up into two distinct, easily digestible collections:  Originals  is, as she puts it, a set of  “laidback piano vibes,” while almost all of its companion  Unlocked  is comprised of the songs from  Originals  reworked with an “upbeat, drums and level up” sound. The result spans everything from jazz ballads to modern dance tracks, with a list of co-writers and collaborators that spans from Swae Lee to Brandi Carlile, but while Keys’ sound is mildly refurbished, the overall sensibility isn’t all that new for her. Keys has been showing off her gift for bridging styles and eras since back when she was a breakout star combining classical piano chops with New York hip-hop and R&B.   Unsurprisingly,  Originals  is the more self-assured of the two sets. Co-produced with her husband Swizz Beats, album opener “Plentiful” starts off with Keys getting her Chopin on before becoming a gritty, gospel-tinged East Coast rap throwback  with a Pusha T cameo. (Wonder how long he’s been sitting on “Playin’ in these keys like Alicia”?)  On “Skydive,” her vocals flutter over an understated piano melody and stark, cracking beat. “Best of Me,” one of several co-writes with neo-soul vet  Raphael Saadiq ,  flips a Sade sample into a moment of ecstasy that’s at once dreamy and hard-hitting. “Is It Insane,” a beautifully desolate torch song reverie so vintage it comes with crackles like an ancient 78, is followed by the trap-soul spaciness of “Billions,” connecting the sounds of Billie Holiday and Summer Walker. Next up: “Love When You Call My Name” is early-Seventies hippie-soul that sounds like a lost track from the record Laura Nyro did with Labelle. This run of historical turns is quintessential Keys. On  “Nat King Cole,” she even offers a kind of mission statement about the hard work it takes to turn your classic influences into contemporary moments — “to put the time into timeless.” It’s like Keys is teaching a survey course at the Institute of Tasteful Musicality. She’d surely make a chill professor.  The dusky time-warping beat on “Nat King Cole” comes from superproducer  Mike Will Made It , who joins Keys to helm nearly the entirety of  Unlocked . They set the tone turning “Only You,” one of  Original ‘s  lesser piano ballads, into a slow-boil house tune with Keys’ vocals pitched around the track for a hall-of-mirrors effect. Some of the juxtapositions are inspired: “Nat King Cole” gets flipped into Portishead-style trip-hop with a great Lil Wayne verse (“They’ll never forget me like Obama/They’ll never forgive me like old summers/In memory lane, they all drivers”), while “Old Memories” goes from Sixties Aretha to Eighties Chaka. There are new songs on  Unlocked  too: “Lala,” a dreamily doting R&B tune with Swae Lee, and “Come For Me,” featuring Lucky Daye and Khalid’s always amiable mumble-croon. Not everything comes together just right. Mike Will struggles to find the right beat for “Love When You Call My Name,” landing on something that feels off and phoned-in, and the hobbled, angry drum thwacks he adds to the hopeful ballad “Daffodils” (co-written with ace Nashville hand N atalie Hemby ) seem more fitting for a petulant Tyler, the Creator track. But staying at your absolute best for an entire album of new remixes probably isn’t easy for such a busy, in-demand guy.    In any case, Keys’ vision is the driving force anyway — at once expansively authoritative and “Hey, let’s try some shit” casual, grand but loose, deeply respectful but a little subversive, too. For Keys, thinking big doesn’t have to mean inflating your ego too.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/alicia-keys-keys-originals-unlocked-1268514/
2021-12-13,Will Dukes,3.5,,Rick Ross is Realer Than Reality on ‘Richer Than I’ve Ever Been’,"Rick Ross, low key, might have invented “yacht rap.” The Miami-bred boss specializes in cigar-to-the-sky manifestos that make the most ruthless coke deals seem like a company cruise. A grizzled behemoth prone to surrealist flights of fancy (and some motivational, meat-and-potatoes grind talk), Ross epitomizes extravagance, largesse, and team goals. He’s like a benevolent  Shark Tank  titan with coke residue still in his beard. Ross has spent the last 15 years arguing that artifice is more real than reality. Postmodernist that he is (this is the same guy who wore a chain of himself wearing a chain of himself), he’s made himself into the most absurd and bombastic symbol of a drug lord, something none of us will ever see in real life but encounter constantly in pop culture; he’s like a rap-game facsimile of Don DeLillo‘s Most Photographed Barn in America from  White Noise . And he capitalizes on that irreality in his grandiose music and over-the-top image.   Ross’s musical formula is appropriately fantastical. His nimble wordplay always hits a surprising stutter-step pocket—he’s like a big man with some serious handles on the court—that legitimizes his luxuriant trapaholic opulence. On  Richer Than I’ve Ever Been , Ross proves that his highfalutin aspirations are a major part of his authenticity.   Opener “Little Havana” sets a credible tone with testimony (”I was the undisputed king in the cocaine industry from the mid-Seventies through the Eighties and into the Nineties”) from former drug czar Willy Falcon. Ross gets an official co-sign from the retired Cocaine Cowboy before laying out a bio that boasts both his alleged underworld bona fides (with Black Mafia Family co-founder Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory) and boardroom power moves: “I was really throwin’ money, I really saw Meech/And I let them rappin’ niggas get closer to Meek.” The cinematic “Marathon,” on which eerie orchestration and haunting pianos evoke the soundtrack to a letterbox version of a lost 1970s Roman Polanski classic, is a goosebumps-rendering catechism for Ross’s insistence on the lavish life. “Do it out of opulence/Really it’s just common sense,” he spits, sounding like he’s also encouraging us to secure a bag. This is megachurch gospel if the pastor genuinely wanted his congregation to view every day as another opportunity to touch some paper. “Wiggle” is a would-be strip-club psalm, which, because it doesn’t convince, begs the question: what is Rick Ross’s legit place in Miami rap? Unlike Luke, Trick Daddy, or his mentor Trina, Rozay doesn’t do unabashed raunch. If anything, he’s a throwback to the mostly East Coast-centric salad days of the late 1990s: his hits feel like classic paeans to flossing rather than ratchet anthems for the turn-up. But “Wiggle” gives us some energetic oomph (and an impressive verse from the Bronx’s DreamDoll), even if it seems tame compared to, say, the colossal “BMF,” which dominated clubs—strip or otherwise—on its hypermasculine terms. There aren’t many moments of reflection here. Only “Made It Out Alive,” with its soul-bearing hook (”From nothin’ to everything that I asked for/From food stamps to stamps on the passport”) captures the earnest fervor of 2017’s  Rather You Than Me . But it’s all smooth sailing on “Imperial High,” where he brags, “Hundred bricks a boy out in St. Croix/For the big-belly-ass rude boy.” Meanwhile, “Hella Smoke,” with its twinkling keys and buoyant bass—enlivened by swank synths—makes an over-the-top flex (”Living lavish, have you married in the Eiffel Tower”) sound as chill as a cuffing-season weekend with the Sunday “Arts & Leisure” section. Rick Ross has turned absurdist clichés into art. What’s more real than that?",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/rick-ross-richer-than-ive-ever-been-1268528/
2021-12-16,Will Dukes,3.5,,Juice WRLD’s Second Posthumous Album Sounds like It Could’ve Been Recorded Yesterday,"When Juice WRLD passed away in 2019 at 21, it seemed like the entire music industry was shaken up. Everyone from Hot 97 host Peter Rosenberg to Vince Staples to Drake shared their fond memories and condolences. Chance the Rapper posted on his Instagram, shortly after the Chicago native’s death, “This is ridiculous. Millions of people, not just in Chicago but around the world are hurting because of this and don’t know what to make of it.”  But most devastated were his legions of young fans, who flooded social media with recollections of what his music meant to them. It’s not surprising. If the term “teenage wasteland” were intellectual property, Juice WRLD surely would have had it copyrighted—his songs, addressing loneliness, addiction, and depression feel like what is to be anxious at the age before our brains are fully developed.  Fighting Demons , his second posthumous album is a tortured but overall grateful memento mori from a talented artist who left us all too soon.    Recorded in the last three years, the songs on  Fighting Demons  sound as if they’re from one session that could have been just yesterday. He had a knack for being on the cutting edge going back to 2017’s “Lucid Dreams,” which hit SoundCloud like a forecast from some burgeoning stoner future. Here, “Rockstar in His Prime,” a downtempo Top 40 contender could still sell out stadiums. The song’s fidgety hi-hats and clean synths—energized by Juice’s soaring chorus—make a muted plea for help (”I can’t deal with this hurt on my own/I cannot deal with this hurt in my downtime”) feel like a euphoric mosh.  The MetroBoomin’-helmed “Burn,” with its gunshot-punctuated percussion and 808s feels like a modern-day equivalent to psychedelic ‘90s journeymen P.M. Dawn on a track by DJ Premier. The contrasts, while thrilling, don’t seem too shocking today. But Juice WLRD hails from the same family tree as P.M. Dawn, who were denounced decades ago for their emo image, bright harmonies, and the kind of content that made Juice WRLD such a beloved figure. “Burn” is all ragged feels (”This remind me of hell, sometimes I wonder if that’s where God really sent me”) made melodic. And it’s a testament, thankfully, to how times have changed—that, in his passing, kids in Juice WRLD’s axis have a safe space to vent without having their agency challenged.  “Wandered To LA” features Justin Bieber and is the sunniest of the album’s 18 tracks. Its staccato guitar and cozy hacienda aura make Juice WRLD’s hazy, “Hotel California” mindset something you’re delighted to inhabit. Elsewhere, “Feline” is a fun lyrical exercise with Trippie Red and fellow Chi-town chum, Polo G. Juice hits a slick pocket, threatening, “Stand up to the opps, never back down/He’ll get beat with the belt like it’s smackdown.” It’s a reminder that he was as keen with his bars as he was with a mellifluous hook.  Though cuts like “My Life In a Nutshell” and the dour “From My Window” wear you down by the album’s end—blame it on dull production and one too many mentions of the drugs that would take Juice’s life—you can’t walk away from  Fighting Demons  feeling anything but affirmed. His graciousness to his listeners is highlighted in the interlude, “Juice WRLD Speaks,” where he says, “Me talking about certain things could help somebody else through what they going  through, as well as me trying to figure it out myself.” He made us feel seen in our struggles. That was Juice WRLD’s purpose and purity.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/juice-wrlds-fighting-demons-1272567/
2021-12-20,Will Dukes,3.5,,Roddy Ricch Just Wants to Celebrate on ‘Live Life Fast’,"Roddy Ricch’s voice is a beguiling instrument—a mess of controlled squeaks and abrupt melodic outbursts. Every turn of phrase lands like it’s a memorable hook. From the jump, the Los Angeles native has drawn comparisons to Young Thug, who is one of his key influences. But Roddy’s barefaced bars—if anything, he’s like an intelligible Thugger—reveal his remarkable persona. He shared his journey on his 2019 debut,  Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial , with songs about his hardships growing up in Compton. Now, after some high-charting hits and the birth of his son last year, Roddy returns on  Live Life Fast  sounding like he just wants to celebrate. “Thailand” is a raucous fly-you-out affair where Roddy’s flow does a minimalist zigzag across the track’s restless low-end slap. Animated one minute, measured the next, each line—heightened by careful enunciation—is a playful use of negative space. Roddy’s tricky inflections make his squad goals (”I want some diamonds, I want some baguetties”) sound like fidgety demands.   Single “Late at Night” is Roddy’s low-key plea to his significant other to stick by him as he grapples with success. Over Mustard’s patented finger-snap percussion, Roddy acknowledges, “I wanna give you trust, but I can’t.” Being famous is around-the-clock demanding. And the 23-year-old just wants a partner who was with him back when he was shooting at the gym—someone who remembers he “really got it out the mud, climbin’ up the ranks.” Roddy thrives when he’s in a meditative mood. And his introspective side made songs like the poignant coming-of-age chronicle “Big Stepper” one of the standouts on his debut. There aren’t too many moments like that here—he’s in full-on floss mode, which makes this sophomore outing a fun, if slightly surface-level listen. But “Rollercoastin’” is a best-of-both-worlds boon. Here, a catchy chorus—sweetened by mellow guitars—fuels his recollections of a wild tryst, concluding with some thankful affirmations for his newborn son. This potential hit is proof that, at the very least, Roddy contains multitudes. The epic “All Good” turns balling into a treatise-worthy punchline: “We ain’t at no playground, I’ma show you how I play though/Bitch say I’m playin’ mind games with her, she call me Plato.” And “No Way,” with its exotic backdrop and assiduous mentions of designer accouterment (”mix the J’s with the double C, you know what I mean?”), makes the fun vibes feel as limitless as the credit allowances on a “Black” card. There’s no stopping the enthusiasm when Roddy Ricch is in go mode.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/roddy-ricch-live-life-fast-1274131/
2021-11-08,Will Dukes,3.5,,Terrace Martin Brings Old-School Warmth on ‘DRONES’,"The music of Terrace Martin is all about warmth. A prominent member of L.A.’s jazz scene, the multi-instrumentalist (and frequent Kendrick Lamar collaborator) builds off funk, hip-hop, and R&B to create lush tapestries that feel as bright and inviting as a perpetual 70-degree day. That cozy human element propels his fantastic new album,  DRONES , whose balmy, high vibes play imaginative counterpoint to the project’s themes of an automated 21st century.  The title track, which features a brief but typically canny chorus from Lamar, has fun with the irony of modern people becoming more and more robotic in our most animalistic state: “I call her only when I want it/They call us drones and we both know/Computers in the dark, makin’ more clones.”   Despite the snug, Rhodes-accented backdrop of “Drones”—which gives off big, local juice bar energy (and would feel at home in a talky scene from the latest episode of “Insecure”)—the message is that sex is all that’s left in place of conversation, communication, and “edumacation,” all, arguably, the most human aspects of our interactions.   Martin adds a lively layer of funk to “Leave Us Be,” bringing benevolence to the topic of aerial police surveillance. And “Sick of Crying”—with its pointed observation that “the hood relentless, pain is all we know”—conjures harrowing street sounds, with a pungent saxophone that’s, nonetheless, an aural snapshot of whatever Venice Beach probably looks like right now. While “Tapped,” whose repetitive warning that we’re all being watched feels a bit on the nose, the blithe spoken-word bit, “Leimert Park” suggests a remedy: whether living under Big Brother or just shooting the shit with big bro, the cut’s resilient refrain is “I’mma always pull up.” All that’s missing are the congratulatory finger snaps. Terrace, it turns out, is just an analog dude in a digital world.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/terrace-martin-drones-1254640/
2021-11-08,Meagan Jordan,4,,Summer Walker Is Literally Over It,"Summer Walker’s music evokes the spirit of the blues. The 25-year-old Atlanta native has a writing ability reminiscent of Bessie Smith’s descriptive love narratives, deeply personal but at the same time reflecting universal emotions and desires. Walker’s 2019 debut,  Over It,  was the most-streamed album by a female artist since Beyonce’s  Lemonade  a few years earlier; her mix of soulful, classic-feeling R&B and raw, modern-day lyrical themes including social anxiety and difficult relationships had fans appointing her, half jokingly, a feminine version of Drake. And while it’s clear she finds all the attention a little unsettling, it’s been a thrill to watch her grow.  Listeners who gravitate to Walker for her intense honesty won’t be disappointed by  Still Over It . On the album-opening “Bitter,” the singer blatantly calls out the drama of her complicated relationship with ex-boyfriend and  Over It  producer London on da Track, who Walker recently had a child with. “London, did you screw this bitch for real?” Walker rhetorically asks, going on to wonder why the woman in question seems to be mad at her before concluding, “Bitches just be lookin’ for attention” on the “Shade Room and Insta.” The song ends with loving yet gritty advice from Cardi B in what appears to be a voicemail. “Don’t let bitches feel like they have one up … do it your own way, do it beautifully, do it special,” Cardi implores.    Musically,  Over It  nodded to R&B icons of the Nineties and early 2000s like 702 and Usher.  Still Over It  builds on that sound, with poppier moments like “Dat Right There,” and “Ex for a Reason,” which features a hard-hitting rap from JT of City Girls. The sultry “No Love,” featuring SZA, is a sex anthem about the need to sometimes “fuck, get drunk,” without the messy emotions that could come with attachment. The album moves smoothly and slowly on songs like “You Don’t Know Me,” the Ari Lennox feature “Unloyal,” and the sexy ballad “Screwin,” showcasing both Walker’s multifaceted voice and the excellent range of duet partner Omarion. The second half of the LP can feel a little too relaxed and laid-back at points, but Walker ends on a powerful note with “4th Baby Mama,” an allusion to her being the mother of London’s fourth child. “I wanna start with your mama, she should’ve whooped your ass,”  she sings. The song’s placement at the end of the album feels symbolic, making it Walker’s conclusive statement that she is, in fact, over it for good.  Following that soft yet cathartic track, she closes things down with a sisterly moment in “Ciara’s Prayer,” a benediction from the R&B singer Ciara: “Lord, thank you for reminding me who I am. I am a queen, I deserve to be treated like one. I’m a warrior, I will get up,” she prays. It’s the affirmation of new love that Walker’s fans have been waiting to hear for years: Lord willing, Summer Walker still has a lot of life — in love, and in music — ahead of her.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/summer-walker-still-over-it-1254788/
2021-11-09,Jonathan Bernstein,4,Snail Mail,Snail Mail Ups Her Game on ‘Valentine’,"“Mia don’t cry, I love you forever,” Lindsey Jordan sings, both to an ex-lover and herself, on her new album. “But I gotta grow up now.”  Growing up has seemingly been on Jordan’s mind quite a bit lately: After making her full-length debut as  Snail Mail  with 2018’s  Lush , which established the 18-year-old singer-songwriter as a fully-formed indie classicist, Jordan’s second record proves that the singer is capable of oh so much more. With its amped-up pop choruses, refined sense of melody, and hints of everything from Blood Orange-inspired R&B to vintage mid-century torch balladry,  Valentine , indeed, opens up entire new worlds of possibilities for her. See the atmospheric call and response chorus of “Forever (Sailing),” or the Sinatra-esque string-laden crooning of “Mia,” or the fragile campfire vulnerability of “c. et al.,” in which Jordan swaps out her electric guitar for some acoustic finger-picking.   Those songs make the moments where Jordan doubles down on her blend of Matador-core indie rock (see “Glory” and “Headlock”) all the more potent. She’s also become a more expansive, expressive vocalist: On the latter tune, she stretches out lines and plays with the phrasing, turning seemingly simple lines like “Mister Death wants my…baby now” into their own one-act plays.   Then, of course, there’s Jordan’s writing, which feels even more self-probing and cutting than last time around. The type of dark-edged couplets that she introduced in  Lush  are plentiful: “I could die if I had had the guts,” she sings on “Automate.” “Puked it up, drank too much/Feed the flame forever.” But in that song’s chorus, Jordan provides a new type of devastating self-aware reflection, sprinkled throughout  Valentine : “Who was I to ever want like this?” The most piercing line of the record comes just a few songs before: “I’ve come to hate my body,” she sings almost as an after-thought towards the end of “Madonna.” “‘Cause now it’s not yours/Now it’s not mine.” There’s also a newfound sense of humor on  Valentine,  which is filled with the type of post-breakup righteous indignation that Jordan already knows she’ll one day look back on with a smile. “You’re taking that tone, icy cold,” she sings on “Forever (Sailing),” “C’mon, I loved you!” Such determination is ever-present on  Valentine . “Light Blue” finds Jordan exploring her dogged commitment to being in love with someone else, no matter how that love may (or, more likely, may not) be returned. “Nothing’s gonna stop me now,” she sings in the tender chorus. The more Jordan sings the line, the more it becomes clear she knows she’s singing about so much more than heartbreak.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/snail-mail-valentine-1252383/
2021-11-11,Jon Dolan,4,,"New Courtney Barnett Record ‘Things Take Time, Take Time’ Is Really Good, Really Good","Courtney Barnett’s 2015 debut,  Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit,  was the sound of a young artist with the melodic chops of a power-pop whiz, the storytelling skills of a good novelist, and the wit of a highbrow sitcom writer. Barnett could’ve built a career coasting on cleverness, but she’s also an empath who’s genuinely interested in finding her place in a brutal world; her second album, the equally great  Tell Me How You Really Feel , had a self-questioning rocker about her modest stardom and a searing song about trying to be patient with creepy fans. Her brilliant third album,  Things Take Time, Take Time,  is her most reserved and thoughtful yet, full of everyday observation and wry wisdom — it grows slowly, but pay attention and you’ll grow with it.    She opens with “Rae Street,” processing the world out her window in Melbourne, Australia; over deliberate guitar strumming, she connects images of people muddling through life (noisy neighbors, parents teaching a kid to ride a bike) to bigger concerns (“light a candle for the suffering”), landing on a joking assessment of her own ambiguous place in all this: “Hope and prayers, though well-meaning, they don’t mean a thing/Unless we see some change/I think I’ll change my sheets today,” she deadpans.    As the album title suggests, the repetition of life feels real in these songs. “Turning Green” appreciates the change in the seasons; on “If I Don’t Hear From You Tonight,” she sings about reading the Bible (“from left to write”). On “Write a List of Things to Look Forward To,” her list includes a letter from a friend, and waiting for the day when they can hang out and “watch the world burn.”  Barnett’s gently revealed guitar playing is all soft late-night jangle, à la Yo La Tengo and the Velvet Underground — from the hypnotically undulating “Before You Gotta Go” to the watery swirls of “Here’s the Thing.” Her musical partner is ace drummer Stella Mozgawa, creating beats that match and enhance Barnett’s every restrained nuance. Obviously, this album is touched by the downtime of Covid, but its sense of wonder and worry, bored longing and faint hope, is utterly eternal. So is its sense of humor, always one of Barnett’s most effective weapons against torpor and dread. Sure, the daily grind can get weird, capitalism enslaves us, the world burns. But as she tells a friend on “Take It Day by Day,” the record’s quickest, catchiest song, “Don’t stick that knife in the toaster/Baby, life is like a roller coaster.” It’s a ride she takes at her own sweet pace.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/courtney-things-take-time-take-time-1256037/
2021-11-12,Rob Sheffield,5,Taylor Swift,‘Red (Taylor’s Version)’ Makes a Classic Even Better,"First things first: Let’s skip to the ending. The long-lost 10-minute original version of “All Too Well” turns out to be even better than we were all hoping.  Taylor Swift  takes her own masterpiece, tears it all up, breaks it like a promise, shreds her tapestry, and rebuilds it into a new heartbreak epic, twice as long and twice as mad. Yes, you just heard Taylor sing the words “fuck the patriarchy.” Yes, you just heard extra verses about this guy meeting her dad and skipping her 21st birthday party. Yes, her greatest song just got greater. No, you’re not fine at all. Ever since Swift announced she was dropping  Red (Taylor’s Version) , remaking her 2012 classic, anticipation has run high. And since she specializes in doing the impossible, here’s yet another insane idea she’s brought to life: the new  Red  is even bigger, glossier, deeper, casually crueler. It’s the ultimate version of her most gloriously ambitious mega-pop manifesto.    Red  is the second chapter of her  Taylor’s Version  project, after  Fearless , redoing her old albums even though she’s hitting her fiercest creative peak right now, dropping two of her  biggest   albums  in 2020. Nothing on this scale has been tried before. This is a leap, even from the girl who invented the whole concept of Never Looking Down.   The new “All Too Well (Original Version)” sums up Swift at her absolute best. The legend is that this was the rough draft, before she cut it down to size, now finally done in a proper studio take with Jack Antonoff. But every emotional detail hits home. She goes deeper into the story, venting her grief and rage, getting so savage it makes “Dear John” sound like “I Will Always Love You.” She hits harder about the age difference, sneering, “I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age.” She quotes Shakespeare’s  All’s Well That Ends Well , seven years before busting out that reference in “Lover.” When the guy fails to show up at midnight for her birthday — a story she’s already told in “The Moment I Knew” and “Happiness” — her dad tries to cheer her up. This is the first time she’s quoted him in a song — he tells her, “it’s supposed to be fun, turning 21” — and it’s a heart-punching moment. Not for the first time, you might catch yourself begging Tay to slow down and give you a minute to recover, but she plunges ahead, because she has no mercy. In the final minutes, in a new coda, she asks, “Did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?/Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?” It’s beyond belief she didn’t release this until now. But it’s beyond belief it even exists. It’s the fitting climax for  Red (Taylor’s Version)  — 30 tracks, the original 16-song  Red  tricked out with B-sides and vault outtakes, all redone with more boom and detail in the production. The new edition clocks in precisely 131 minutes, and if you think that number might be a coincidence, catch up.       Red  was her greatest album, and seemed destined to wear that crown forever—until  Folklore  and  Evermore  came along. (That’s her top three—but wait, what about  Speak Now ? An argument for another day.) It’s where she proved herself not just the supreme pop songwriter of her generation, but one of the all-timers.   Red  wasn’t her first masterwork, but it’s the one that established the Swiftian universe as a place where every lost scarf is a ticking time bomb that can take years to explode into a classic song.   The challenge of  Red (Taylor’s Version)  was how to remake an unimprovable original. You could argue with the sequencing — the hard-rocking “Holy Ground” might have fit better in the Number Two spot behind “State of Grace,” where it sat on the Red Tour set-list, but that’s a quibble on such a preposterously perfect album. Hidden gems like “I Almost Do” or “Sad Beautiful Tragic” would be career highlights for nearly anyone else, but here they’re overshadowed by even loftier tunes. (Not even Swift seems to care for “Sad Beautiful Tragic,” which she’s barely ever done live, yet some of us will die on this sad, beautiful, and tragic little hill.)  But as on  Fearless,  her adult voice adds new power to these songs, especially deep cuts like “Come Back…Be Here” and “The Moment I Knew.” It sounds different to hear “Holy Ground” sung by the Taylor who went on to write “Cornelia Street” and “Coney Island.” And it’s poignant to hear her thirty-something voice go back to “Begin Again,” the ballad that ends the album on a note of fragile optimism, as if she sees the refrigerator light at the end of the tunnel. In “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” there’s a little extra venom way she snarls “trust me” — which might come from an additional 9 years of hearing men ask her to trust them. “Nothing New” might be the most eagerly awaited vault song — a duet with kindred spirit Phoebe Bridgers, about growing older, with the question, “How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22?” It’s a story they know well — “people love an ingenue” — and they can both relate to lyrics about crying in your room. It’s a sensitive Aaron Dessner production, mostly just his acoustic guitar with an orchestration from brother/bandmate Bryce. (Here’s hoping we get a whole Taylor/Phoebe duet album? Produced by Dessner? Please?) We finally get proper Swift versions of “Better Man” and “Babe,” country hits she gave away to other artists. “Babe” was a 2018 Sugarland hit, “Better Man” a 2016 hit for Little Big Town, but both thrive with Swift singing lead. (Dessner produces “Better Man,” while Antonoff takes “Babe” — did they flip a coin?) “Message in a Bottle” is a dance-pop zinger written with Max Martin and Shellback the day she met them; the even perkier “The Very First Night” sounds like it’s part of the same jet-set rock-star romance as “Come Back…Be Here.”   “I Bet You Think About Me” is a rowdy all-the-way country duet with Chris Stapleton — the kind of Nashville hit she was about to leave behind, with her twang on display. She baits a high-tone ex about his “organic shoes” and “cool indie music concerts.” (In 2012, that probably meant he was going to see the National and Bon Iver, before she started writing with them.) “Think About Me” and “Forever Winter” have scenes set at 3 a.m., an hour later than her usual favorite time for pacing the floor. “Ronan” is a one-of-a-kind song for her, a 2012 charity single based on the blog of a bereaved mother writing about the death of her 4-year-old son from cancer. Swift turned Maya Thompson’s blog posts into a song (with Thompson’s blessing, of course) and released it as a benefit for cancer research. She sings it with even more soul now. “Ronan” is the kind of song that’s nearly impossible to pull off without seeming manipulative, but that’s what makes it such a deft tribute, as well as a template for the kind of narratives she’d go on to write in  Folklore  and  Evermore .  “Run” is a peppy acoustic duet with Ed Sheeran — not to be confused with the George Strait song she once covered as a tribute. They wrote “Run” the day they met — on the same trampoline where they wrote “Everything Has Changed.” Everything might have changed in their lives and careers, but not the fact that they really do sing like two friends who know how to listen to each other.  She’s kept telling these stories over the years, so the songs take on new dimensions. “Sad Beautiful Tragic” plays off “All Too Well (Original Version),” which also milks the phrase “love affair.” “The Lucky One” always felt partly like a Britney tribute (Taylor has covered “Lucky” live) but it hits different in the Free Britney era, especially lines like “You don’t feel pretty, you just feel used.” ( Red  comes out the same day Britney might get out of her conversatorship, which would be that rarest of things, a coincidence Taylor didn’t plan. But it would be a hell of a cool one.) The acoustic “State of Grace,” always a highlight of the expanded  Red , feels even more autumnal now.   Needless to say, Swift doesn’t need to be doing this. Remaking the oldies is the kind of project you assocate with someone who’s run out of gas, not an artist this prolific.  Fearless (Taylor’s Version)  is the second best-selling album of the year — the only thing keeping it from the top spot is her own  Evermore . (Just like Paul McCartney in 1976 — the Beatles’ comp  Rock and Roll Music  got blocked on the charts at Number Two, stuck behind  Wings at the Speed of Sound .)  But that’s the amazing thing about  Red (Taylor’s Version)  — it’s a tribute to how far she’s traveled, but it makes you even more excited for where she’s heading next. This is the golden age of something good and right and real. And for Swift, the golden age is really just beginning.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/review-red-taylors-version-1255956/
2021-11-12,Jon Dolan,4,"Anderson Paak,Bootsy Collins,Bruno Mars,Silk Sonic",Silk Sonic Are Here to Save Us With Seventies Soul,"Silk Sonic  is  Bruno Mars  and Anderson .Paak’s lavish love letter to Seventies soul music, particularly post- W hat’s Going On  Motown and the sumptuous, string-bathed Philadelphia sound of greats like the Stylistics, the Delfonics, and Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes. They created  A Night With Silk Sonic  during Covid quarantine, as chronicled in  their recent  Rolling Stone  cover story , giving the famously obsessive Mars  a ll the time in the world to fixate on getting every period detail perfect. The pair hunted down old drum magazines to make sure they were using the right snare and conga heads, cut some of the record in Memphis’ Royal Studios, where Al Green made his classic albums, and even brought in forebears like Larry Gold, of the legendary Philly International house band MFSB, to arrange and conduct strings, and P-Funk icon  Bootsy Collins , who appears throughout the album, as a special guest host and spiritual advisor. The result is the most enjoyable record Mars has been a part of — a glorious excuse to turn out the lights, break out the bubbly and let the sublime power of their almost troublingly uncanny retro verisimilitude work its mimetic magic on your soul and mind.    The resplendently stretched-out grooves of the hit “Leave the Door Open” or the equally fine “After Last Night” are so historically accurate you almost expect to hear Teddy Pendergrass himself come in when the verse starts. “Put On a Smile” is so close to the vibe of Marvin Gaye’s  Let’s Get It On  that you start humming “Distant Lover” when it comes on. There’s Thom Bell sitar, Ernie Isley guitar, melodies hoisted aloft on cushiony beds of glockenspiel, congas, violas, violins, and cellos. But while cosplaying the classics is a huge part of the appeal here, Bruno and Andy also bring a lovingly winking post-hip-hop playfulness that keeps this from merely being a high-end museum tour. On “Leave the Door Open,” they promise a night of “Purple Haze, and if you’re hungry, I got filets” — not a sentiment you’d hear quite so frankly on the radio in 1974 — and the stressed-out boyfriend in the deceptively airy “Smokin Out the Window” complains about his new girl’s “badass kids runnin’ ’round my whole crib like it’s Chuck E. Cheese” and “a jam with her ex-man in the UFC.”  Mars’ perfectionist bent has given even his most beloved hits, like “Uptown Funk,” a mathematical precision that can sometimes feel a touch too manicured and fine-tuned. But the more frenetically energetic .Paak, who drums and shares copacetic duo vocals, brings a looser, free associating counterpoint, particularly on James Brownian workouts like “Fly As Me” and “777,” grittier songs driven by his  Ultimate Breaks & Beats -worthy stick work.  It also helps that some of the songs here are literally as straight-up good as the holy grail source material Silk Sonic are shooting for. The best song on the record is “Skate,” opening like it’s going to be a high-drama anthem of stormy betrayal until it glides into a sunburst of roller-disco elation with a melody that could’ve owned any summer during the Ford administration.  Mars and .Paak have noted that they chose not to include a “heavier” track they’d recorded for the album, suggesting that the good time is a kind of reward in times of struggle. There’s something period-perfect about that, too. Philly Soul could definitely be political (see the Blue Notes’ “Wake Up Everybody,” or the Philadelphia International All-Stars’ even more pointed “Clean Up the Ghetto,” just to take two examples). But its plush grooves, smooth romantic entreaties, and dapper style were a balm amidst hardship in its time as well, offering people a place to comedown and relax after the frenzy of the late-Sixties and the burnout of the early-Seventies. In that sense,  A Night With Silk Sonic  hits a welcome note in late 2021, just as people are starting to feel okay about going back out trying to have some normal fun again. It’s a post-pandemic record — maybe a little early, hopefully right on time.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/silk-sonic-album-review-1256403/
2021-11-12,Kory Grow,4,Nirvana,Hear Nirvana Grow Up Fast in New ‘Nevermind’ Box Set,"It took roughly four months for  Nirvana  to become  NIRVANA. You already know the mythology: Two duders about 100 miles outside of Seattle (Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic) recruited a Virginia-based drummer (Dave Grohl) and put out the band’s grungy second album,  Nevermind , on Sept. 24, 1991. Then, in a Tasmanian Devil cyclone of flannel, cheerleaders, and ohwellwhatevernevermind, they redefined pop music for a couple of years as a crucible for angst. But in reality, as this  new box set  — which commemorates the record’s 30th anniversary by pairing the original album with four live recordings — demonstrates, the trio’s transformation into rock deities didn’t occur literally overnight. On the official concert bootlegs here, the trio chronicle their improbable ascent to superstardom. The concerts date between November 1991 and February 1992, showing how the band’s growth over just a few months was remarkable.   And while yet another super-deluxe  Nevermind  box set might seem on the surface like a pale cash-in for the unlikeliest of “corporate rock whores” (as one of their own T-shirts once chintzily described them), the collection tells a fresh, unique story. Where the  20th anniversary anthology  showed their creative process leading up to  Nevermind’ s release through demos, rehearsal tapes, rough mixes, and other detritus, this one shows what happened next.   When Nirvana played Amsterdam’s Paradiso on Nov. 25, 1991 — included here both as audio and video on a Blu-ray — they still seem frozen in the indie-rock ways of their debut album, 1989’s  Bleach.  In the concert film, footage from which previously appeared on their  Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!  home video, Cobain stands stock still for much of the set, as shirtless Dutch stage divers cavort around him and Novoselic; other than when the singer-guitarist topples Grohl’s drum kit at the end of the set, the only real drama occurs when he gently sets his microphone on the floor for “Breed,” crouching every time he yelps “She said.” Despite a thin-sounding mix that undersells the band’s bottom end (the concert was recorded for Dutch public television), Cobain’s voice sounds raw and magnificent throughout, and Novoselic and Grohl match his precision even in awkward moments, like the noise-rock breakdown in “Drain You” (which sounds even more like the Velvet Underground’s “Black Angel’s Death Song” live). The only rough patch comes when Cobain torpedoes “Come as You Are” by caterwauling the lyrics as disgustingly as possible after a quasi–hissy fit over his inability to tune his guitar correctly. Novoselic, clad in a K Records T-shirt, is the most animated member, bouncing up and down and wiggling, while Grohl, then age 22 (wearing a Hole shirt), simply looks happy to be there. When one stage diver dances a jig during “Love Buzz,” Grohl goofily sings the Village People’s “Macho Man” in time to the riff. They were still living the anti-rock-star ethos they preached (the bumper sticker on Cobain’s guitar reads: “Vandalism: Beautiful as a rock in a cop’s face”) and, mostly, they played brilliantly. It’s a shame this is the only concert video included here because they sound progressively better in each of the concerts that follow; you have to imagine how they ratcheted up their performances leading up to  In Utero  (or just cue up their  Live at Reading  film). A month after the Dutch gig, the band played an abridged version of the same set list for an opening gig between Pearl Jam and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Del Mar, California. The mix sounds fuller, with more Novoselic up front (two tracks appeared as B sides on the “In Bloom” single, and  Nevermind  mixing engineer Andy Wallace mixed the entire concert), and every time Cobain opens his mouth you can practically hear the vocal nodules growing as he shreds his cords. “Smells Like Teen Spirit” sounds gloriously sloppy and animated, and the band’s collective power drives “Lithium” any time Cobain howls “Yeaah” in the chorus — it’s a welcome reminder that only three musicians could sound like a runaway dump truck whenever they wanted to. But the real magic in the box set manifests during the band’s Melbourne, Australia, gig on Feb. 1, 1992. Cobain urges the crowd to sing along with him on “Lithium” — a track that hadn’t even come out as a single yet — and the audience nearly drowns him out, gleefully belting his lyrics about feeling simultaneously happy and ugly and not caring who knows it. Cobain sounds so into it, he forgot to kick on his distortion pedal for the song’s primal “yeah” chorus. When the band plays “Polly” later in the set, Cobain doesn’t even need to ask the audience to sing along — it knows what to do. When the group finishes, after a jam that features Grohl reciting Spinal Tap’s “Stonehenge” monologue, the audience chants, “We want more,” over and over.   The concert is surprising, since the audiences in the first two live recordings come off relatively reserved (other than stage diving), so the singalongs mark a noticeable turning point when the crowd becomes an equal player in the Nirvana story; it’s the moment when the band graduates from indie sensations to pop stars — and, contrary to the Cobain mythology that followed, you can hear the band  enjoy  becoming mainstream. By Nirvana’s Tokyo gig three weeks later, their metamorphosis into Gen-X Beatles is complete. They come off confident and self-assured on this collection’s final live recording; they even play “Smells Like Teen Spirit” last, instead of jamming it into the middle of the set, as was their usual habit. Their performances of “Lithium,” “About a Girl,” and “Teen Spirit” at this gig are the best of the live renditions; Cobain even plays a distortion-filled feedback solo on the latter hit, confirming his qualifications both as both guitar hero and guitar antihero (witness also his country-twang playing on “Breed”). The smoothness of Grohl’s backing vocals play beautifully off Cobain’s acidic howling on “On a Plain” and “Polly,” and Grohl even explains he’s feeling healthy that night, after a bout of flu, thanks to a serum a doctor had given him that contains “Chinese herbs, and it has cow sperm in it, and it’s got like lizard penis scrapings.” (On “School,” Cobain sings and screams “Drinking cow sperm again” instead of “You’re in high school again.”) It’s a fun, silly set showing how the band gamely transitioned into fame and even enjoyed it for a bit before the world crashed down on it two years later. The Tokyo concert is also the best-sounding boot of the bunch, not that any of them sound particularly bad. Although the concerts here will likely offer nothing new to die-hard Nirvaniacs — each has circulated on the bootleg market for years — none of them have ever sounded this good. Part of that might be because  Bleach  producer Jack Endino, who in recent years has freshened up great reissues for Soundgarden and Green River, had a hand in preparing each of them, though it could also be that the folks who recorded the concerts originally might have realized they were documenting history. (Aside: These concerts also make a good case that the band should have figured out a way to get the underrated “Teen Spirit” B side “Aneurysm” on the track list for  Nevermind .)   As for  Nevermind  itself, the album sounds as aggressive, poppy, stupid, and contagious as when it came out. Though in the context of today, it’s unlikely an album with so many lyrics about guns (literally, the LP’s first words are “Load up on guns”) or first-person accounts of sexual assault (“Polly,” and whatever the hell Cobain meant by “I’m so horny, that’s OK, my will is good” on “Lithium”) would appeal to today’s teenagers, who cope with tragedy through sincerity more than the irony of Generation X. But then again, Cobain described his generation at the time as still making sense of Reagan-era corruption a few years earlier, and that’s not too different from the post-Trump era. In that regard, the times change but the angst remains the same. What matters now is the way Cobain impressionistically strung words, seemingly haphazardly, into lyrics, and how those words still made sense as a mood; it remains one of the greatest feats of pop art this side of Warhol. “Smells Like Teen Spirit” has no narrative to it; it’s simply a feeling that affected millions. At the time, critics pegged Nirvana as being like the Replacements but less witty, but there’s a reason  Nevermind  entered the pop stratosphere and  Tim  didn’t: It’s the way Cobain paired those words, sung in a primal scream, with blunt, guileless riffs that sounded a bit like the Sex Pistols attempting an Aerosmith cover. The effect is very direct. In that regard,  Nevermind  isn’t really punk or nihilistic; it’s the sound of accepting disillusionment. The curious thing now is how Cobain’s disenchantment got him everything he craved — recognition, critical plaudits, fame, validation — and how he sounds happy here, as his fans sing along with all of his pretty songs even if they don’t know what they mean. The experience was likely inspiring, because within a year he started taking agency over his legacy. He forced Novoselic and Grohl to sign a legal document to retroactively grant him the rights to most of the songs (the credits in this reissue do not say “Music by Nirvana,” as the original album did, for a reason), and he almost split up the band in the process, but for once he might have felt pride in his convictions and his talent. Tragically, that feeling was fleeting. This box set is important because it captures Nirvana approaching their most manic high; it’s a snapshot from the top of the roller coaster waiting for the plunge.

2021-11-17,Rob Sheffield,5,Adele,’30’ Is the Best Adele Album Yet,"“Mummy’s been having a lot of big feelings recently,”  Adele  announces early on in  30 . Hands up — who’s surprised? This is Adele, after all. She was  born with big feelings , and ever since the day she first stepped into a recording studio, she’s been off-the-charts brilliant at sharing them with the world. That’s why total strangers hear ourselves in the swoops and raptures of her voice, even as it gets more flexible, stealthy, dangerous. If you were expecting this woman’s divorce album to be a smooth ride, you’re definitely in the wrong place.  Adele has never sounded more ferocious than she does on  30  — more alive to her own feelings, more virtuosic at shaping them into songs in the key of her own damn life. It’s her toughest, most powerful album yet. “All love is devout,” Adele declares in the magnificent “Cry Your Heart Out,” and she walks it like she talks it. She travels her own Via Dolorosa, walking a treacherous path of heartache, motherhood, boozy despair, and loneliness.   This is her first batch of songs since the collapse of her marriage — as she summed it up, “Divorce, baby.” But it’s also her turning-thirty   album, so she’s navigating a host of turbulent emotional transitions. Which makes it … an Adele album. Let’s face it, she’s never been shy about facing her messiest feelings, but time just makes her bolder. As she confides in the album’s centerpiece, “Hold On,” “Every day feels like the road I’m on/Might just open up and swallow me whole/How do I feel so mighty small/ When I’m struggling to feel at all?” There’s a lot of that going around lately. “Strangers by Nature” begins the album with a Fender Rhodes keyboard hook and jazzy torch-ballad melodrama, like a mix of Portishead and Lauryn Hill, setting a tone for the whole set. The music is steeped in time-traveling R&B flourishes, going back to Old Hollywood for “Love Is a Game” and 1970s soul for “Hold On.” “All Night Parking” is a duet with the late jazz piano legend Erroll Garner, who died a decade before Adele was born.  You wouldn’t think it was possible, but her vocals have gotten even more expressive. Adele’s voice is a tank division that can tap dance — the more mature she gets as an artist, the more finesse and tact she brings to the microphone, without sacrificing any of the primal firepower that made her famous in the first place. It’s all there in the single  “Easy on Me,”  where she pauses midsong to linger on the first note of “easy” so long that you feel like you might pass out, even though you can tell she isn’t breaking a sweat.  On her blockbuster Sunday-night  CBS concert special , she introduced the world to “I Drink Wine,” a career highlight that indeed takes inspiration from Elton John and Bernie Taupin, a piano rave where Adele has to play both Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowgirl. She grapples with feelings so fierce, she can’t share them with anyone except the mirror, the couch, the second or third empty bottle of the night, a gospel choir, and a planet full of sentient humans wired to every tremble of her voice.  She goes for wild-ass humor in this song as she sings, “When I was a child every single thing could blow my mind/Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine.” But she also asks herself tough questions with no answers: “Why am I obsessing about the things I can’t control?/Why am I seeking approval from people I don’t even know?” By the end, she’s wishing peace and happiness for her ex, but with no regrets about saying goodbye, because “sometimes the road less-traveled is a road best left behind.” What a a song — one of the most ambitious feats she’s ever attempted.   “Cry Your Heart Out” is another career highlight, with sped-up cartoon-chipmunk voices giving way to a seething reggae skank, girl-group hand claps, and Hammond B-3 organ. “When I wake up I’m afraid at the idea of facing the day,” Adele confesses. “I would rather stay home on my own/Drink it all away.” But — typically on a breakup album with no good guys and bad guys — she doesn’t blame anyone else. As she sings, “I created this storm/It’s only fair I have to sit in its rain.”  That even-handed tone is one of the most striking things about  30 ,  considering it’s a divorce album — Adele has zero interest in cheap score-settling. She doesn’t default to the petty payoffs of finding villains to demonize for her emotional chaos; the way she tells the story, it’s all on her. She keeps making you wonder: How can so much drama come from such a well-adjusted, civilized adult? Her collaborators rise to the occasion, with deft productions from her regular wingman Greg Kurstin, as well as Ludwig Göransson, Tobias Jesso, Max Martin, and Shellback. And it’s a star-making moment for London producer Inflo, who steps up to the spotlight in gems like the sultry acoustic-guitar workout “Woman Like Me” and the solo showstopper “Hold On,” which comes on a bit like Ghostface Killah’s Nineties hip-hop tearjerker with Mary J. Blige, “All That I Got Is You.” It builds from sparse piano until it explodes into strings and a live band; according to the credits, the choir is “Adele’s crazy friends,” which sounds about right. Adele fiends for love in all its various forms, from the carnal cravings of “Oh My God” and “Can I Get It” to the maternal pangs of “My Little Love.” But she hits new highs in “To Be Loved,” just a vocal fireworks display, with a piano to guide her. Adele breaks down and admits, as if under duress, “Let it be known that I cried for you.” And then she punches the word “known” over and over until it gushes blood. It’s an exhilarating moment — like the rest of the album, it’s the sound of a woman who suffered through a horrific crisis without losing her soul, her passion, or her sense of humor. And all over  30,  you can hear her sense of triumph that she made it all the way through. Hello, from the other side.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/adele-30-review-1258480/
2021-11-19,Mosi Reeves,2.5,,Snoop Dogg Wants to Build a Bridge Between Gen-Z and Old Heads on ‘The Algorithm’,"Think of Snoop Dogg’s  The Algorithm  as good housekeeping. Even legendary brands like Def Jam occasionally need revitalization. The label may be decades removed from its late Nineties renaissance when giants like Jay-Z, DMX, and Ja Rule ruled the universe. But when the Doggfather announced in June that he was onboard as an executive creative and strategic consultant, it reminded folks that hey, Def Jam still exists. It’s more than just a trademark at the bottom of a Justin Bieber album. Alas,  The Algorithm  doesn’t make an overwhelming case for Def Jam as a relevant movement on par to Quality Control Music remaking Atlanta rap or Griselda leading a new golden era. It’s not a full-fledged Snoop Dogg album, either – instead, he serves as a host, appearing on most but not all 25 tracks. His first major signee, Benny the Butcher, only shows up once on the bruising, superior posse cut “Murder Music” alongside Busta Rhymes and Jadakiss. Same with YK Osiris of “Worth It” fame, who croons alongside Snoop on “Applying Pressure.” Boldfaced Def Jam stars like Kanye West’s GOOD Music team, Logic and YG are nowhere to be heard. (Dave East dutifully clocks in, rhyming alongside Fabolous and Snoop on the strip-club bop “Make Some Money.”) Instead, there’s “Big Subwoofer,” a decent albeit somewhat mediocre banger from Snoop, Ice Cube, E-40 and Too Short’s OG supergroup Mount Westmore. Redman and Method Man reunite on “Alright.” Meanwhile, “New Oldie” finds Usher wistfully crooning alongside Eric Bellinger, “This is a new oldie…later on I’m a look back and say that this was my jam.”   Perhaps “New Oldie” defines Snoop’s strategy: building a bridge between Gen-Z and old heads increasingly making their presence felt through the upcoming Universal Hip-Hop Museum, Verzuz streams and LL Cool J’s fledgling Rock the Bells empire. He invites prospects like melodic rapper Blxst (a Red Bull Records artist best known for 2020’s “Chosen”); as well as singers Malaya and Nefertiti Avani. The  veteran songwriter  Jane Handcock gets three tracks, more than anyone else save Snoop. Her track “I Like My Weed” has a nice, bluesy flow reminiscent of BJ the Chicago Kid. And what about the man of the hour? Snoop conjures a familiar G-funk bounce for “No Bammer Weed,” claims he’s “known to get the party shakin’” alongside Larry June and October London on “Qualified,” and floats alongside Mary J. Blige over the disco-boogie of “Diamond Life.” It’s all modestly pleasant to listen to. But if he wants to resurrect Def Jam as a true cultural force and not just a legacy imprint in the UMG galaxy, he’ll have to bring stronger smoke than  The Algorithm.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/snoop-dogg-wants-to-build-a-bridge-between-gen-z-and-old-heads-on-the-algorithm-1258932/
2021-11-22,Will Dukes,3.5,French Montana,French Montana Embodies Rap History And Makes Some of His Own,"French Montana  has a knack for crafting au courant earworms that pay subtle homage to rap’s illustrious history. After cementing his rep as New York’s most in-demand mixtape maven (under the careful tutelage of ByrdGang iconoclast and self-proclaimed “wave God,” Max B), the Bronx MC topped the charts in 2012 with “Shot Caller,” which had IG models and dope boys bopping to the same madcap horns from Lords of the Underground’s grimy 1993 cut, “Funky Child.” It hit the streets like a gleeful tsunami — everyone wanted to ride the wave. French epitomizes Kurtis Blow’s “AJ scratch” bar — from 1984, the year the Moroccan emigre was born: “Up in the Bronx where the people are fresh.” Indeed he’s part of a renaissance that has brought new light and vibrancy to rap’s birthplace — along with Cardi B and Desus & Mero, he’s helped make the Boogie Down seem like the coolest place on earth. On  They Got Amnesia , French makes sure we never forget that his bona fides are bulletproof.   On the legacy-minded “How You King?” he slurs, over the archetypal “Impeach the President” break, “Ten years plus, need hits? French got ’em.” You get the sense that, beyond airplay, he’s wondering how he measures up against the greats when he later asks, “Do you put Hov where you put B.I.G. and Snoop at?/Or you put him higher ’cause he made it bigger through that?” He seems to aspire to their legendary status, even if he hasn’t yet shown their level of substance and depth. “Mopstick” makes some strides toward that with insightful observations over Boi-1da’s sparse but mellifluous bounce. “When you broke and trapping, that ain’t easy/Better have a pastor, mask up like Yeezy,” French asserts. And there’s a sobering aspect to his tone that makes it clear he’s not just the cavalier Page Six mainstay who used to carry around a pet monkey. But then again, this is the same cat who took a Kardashian to that ghetto-fabulous getaway, City Island, which is a jersey-in-the-rafters-level flex. And “I don’t really Care” applauds that milestone (”came through with Khloe down the city island”). It’s a banger built for insouciant stunting. But the bloated “FWMGAB” —  revisit of Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz’s 1997 “Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)” — feels like the sequel no one asked for. The emo “Losing Weight,” however, offers some much-needed introspection. Referencing Cam’Ron’s immortal “Harlem Streets,” French reminisces on the tough times before fame: “Every day we movin’ weight/Just to try to move away.” This purveyor of the wave is far from shallow.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/french-montana-they-got-amnesia-review-1260188/
2021-10-27,Jon Weigell,4,"Album,band,Hushed and Grim,mastodon,Metal",Mastodon Crush/Redeem You on ‘Hushed and Grim’,"Metal ? Rock? Prog? Who knows anymore. All we know is that  Mastodon  are still exceedingly adept at the ageless art of kicking ass.  After 21 years on the job, the venerated Atlanta shredders haven’t lost a thunderous step; in fact, on their eighth  album ,  Hushed and Grim ,  they’ve gained a whole new footing.  Mastodon began as an aggressive sludge-metal group that came of age in the shadow of bands like Sleep and Neurosis. That sludge-ridden “stoner” style saw a boom in the 2000s with acts such as Baroness and Torche, but Mastodon had especially unique success with their early work; so much success that members Brent Hinds, Troy Sanders, Bill Kelliher, and Brann Dailor are now legends in heavy music.    The 2010s brought about an interesting decade for the  band . After producing a line of heavy hitters like  Remission  (2002) ,  Leviathan  (2004) ,  Blood Mountain  (2006),   and the incredibly progressive  Crack the Skye  (2009)  in the 2000s, Mastodon cut their teeth on a more rock-centric sound, starting with  The Hunter  (2011) and ending at  Emperor of Sand  (2017) . Although some hardcore fans long for another  Leviathan , Mastodon continue to expand their songwriting and show that they aren’t afraid to take risks.   As the band’s legacy has grown, so has its vocal prowess. Dailor, Mastodon’s enigmatic drum wizard, started singing on  Crack the Skye,  and is now poised as a clean, spacy vocal foil to Sanders’ rugged bellow and the superb gritty twang of Hinds.  Hushed and Grim  builds on that synergy and plays to the strengths of each vocalist, giving them all space to shine amid Kelliher’s ever-shifting bedrock of guitar riffs. “Pain With an Anchor,” reminiscent of  Blood Mountain ‘s “The Wolf Is Loose,”  opens the album with a flurry of fills from Dailor. This track sets the heaviness barometer for the rest of the album. The last minute in particular provides optimal mosh material. On a more progressive note, “ More Than I Could Chew” nearly reaches seven minutes and gives you everything a Mastodon track can give. Hinds wails on his guitar solo, Brann and Troy trade off vocal lines, and the impact of each phrase is both gargantuan and simultaneously thought-provoking. That music’s balanced emotional charge is echoed in the lyrics. Sanders’ line in “Sickle and Peace” sums up the mood: “No feeling’s ever final/Just another scar I wear and hold dear.” As that lyric suggests, the album is no doubt influenced by the group’s late manager Nick John, who passed away in 2018. It’s a shared experience that colors longstanding lyrical themes of perseverance, self-doubt, and depression, making  Hushed and Grim  one of Mastodon’s most personal studio albums to date. Other lyrical moments, such as Dailor’s verse on “Teardrinker,” also show the depths of Mastodon’s humanity: “I can see your face/And I feel the pain/And I feel the shame/That I have let you down again,” he sings. Tracks like “Dagger,” “Had It All,” and of course “Teardrinker” are powerful songs about picking yourself back up after a devastating experience, and finding your peace amid the aftershock of loss. Meanwhile, opuses like “Gigantum,” “Gobblers of Dregs,” and “Sickle and Peace” add to that sense of urgency to create the heaviest Mastodon record in quite a while.   Hushed and Grim  never stops  giving, and  the album’s energy, depth, and power make it a completely unique addition to the band’s mammoth catalog.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/mastodon-hushed-and-grim-1244255/
2021-10-28,Jon Dolan,4,"Geese,New York City","Geese Are Legit Indie-Rock Prodigies, Straight Out of High School","Geese  are a band of Brooklyn kids just out of high school, but they’ve already got the indie-rock-prodigy thing easily in hand on their excellent debut. The erudition on  Projector  can be pretty staggering. You can hear NYC guitar zone-out Zen masters like Television, the Feelies, and Parquet Courts; the early-’00s neo-New Wave and dance-punk of the Strokes, the Rapture, and LCD Soundsystem; scads of art-spaz stuff from DNA to Deerhoof to Black Midi; and even a flash of prog touchstones like Yes and Radiohead. Singer Cameron Winter can hoist his voice into a Thom Yorkean falsetto, put on a posh pou t à la  Julian Casablancas or Ian McCulloch of Echo and the Bunnymen, or lapse into a stentorian yawp that brings to mind Mark E. Smith of the Fall or Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner. Sometimes you can hear it all cross-pollinating within the space of the same three-minute song, making for an album that rewards both short attention spans and deep listening. It’s a real treat to hear them zip between sonic epiphanies.   Geese have been getting a lot of baby-band hype, but they’ve playing together for years. That time together gives their music a veteran chemistry and confidence that almost feels disconcerting considering their age — like when you get to college and meet some terrifyingly smart kid in freshman year English who casually claims she’s already read  Ulysses . “Fantasies/Survival” starts off like a fun riff on the early Strokes, until it speeds off into the stratosphere, wearing its hand-me-down black leather jacket like Superman’s cape. “First World Warrior” stretches out with a patient, gorgeous ambient spaciousness that stands in sharp contrast to the angular, over-heated tumult of songs like the album-opener “Rain Dance.”   At their best, Geese connect these two impulses — their fidgety side and their dreamy side coming together to make music that’s at once driving and disoriented, undercutting its man-size musical command with the youthful wonder, ambivalence, and worry you’d expect from sharp teenagers. “I’m afraid of the world/’Cause I don’t know what it might do,” Winter sings on “Exploding House,” their dazzling expression of  OK Compute r-style paranoid angst. When the title track opens with him singing “Underneath the basement/I am the king of cicadas,” the lordly cockiness feels tongue-in-cheek; when he admits “I’m only human,” a minute or so later, it sounds much more sincere. The album’s centerpiece is the six-minute single “Disco,” which goes from stormy no-wave stomp to Television-style guitar surrealism, as Winter describes a rough night at out at the club that unfolds like a nightmare vision of the Strokes’ bygone NYC player’s paradise: “You threw your drink on me as I was leaning over/But I still asked you if you wanted to leave/I talk to the mirror like I’m trying to start a fight.” Not a bad metaphor for coming of age in the horror-show reality of 2021. Luckily, on  Projector , Geese know all the right noise to guide us to a good time anyway.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/geese-projector-1247383/
2021-10-29,David Browne,3,"Ed Sheeran,Equals","On ‘Equals,’ Ed Sheeran Is Happy Now. Is That Good Enough?","Pop mutates with the times and tech, artists go in and out of vogue, but for many pop stars, the song — and the narrative — remains the same. First albums teeming with ambition and vigor give way to followups that grapple with fame, success and perhaps excess — which in turn pave the way for the inevitable newfound-maturity phase. For  Ed Sheeran , that moment arrives in the very first line on  =  (pronounced “ equals ”), his fourth album not counting his  Collaborations  side projects: “I am grown up, I am a father now,” he croons over unexpectedly lashing guitars, acknowledging his recent marriage and fatherhood. He admits to still loving “getting out of my mind” but to feeling “embarrassed ‘bout the things that I did in my youth/‘Coz now I have a child I know one day that she’ll go through it.”   Other than his use of mathematical symbols as album titles, it wasn’t necessarily a given that Sheeran would end up in that space. His first three records were riddled with tales of drunken one-night stands, romantic foibles, and declarations of love (“Only One”) that felt more idealized than based in real life. This is someone who once sang, “Everybody said we’d be together forever but I know that I never wanna settle down, come around.” But now, as a 30-year-old husband and father, he confronts the eternal challenge faced by everyone from McCartney to Adele: Minus the pain-is-art factor, can newly settled-down pop stars make music as gripping as they did when they were single, driven and occasionally out of their minds?   Musically, at least, Sheeran is willing to give it a go on   = . Another rule of pop is that the bigger an act becomes and the larger venues they fill, the more inflated their sound becomes in order to reach those upper-tier cheap seats. (Coldplay now sound as if they’re playing music meant to be blasted out to inhabits of nearby galaxies.) Perhaps reflecting the way Sheeran is now at home in stadiums — where, impressively, he can command tens of thousands with merely his guitar and electronic loops — much of  =  ditches the folk-pop of his first album for choruses meant to incite cell-phone-lit sing-alongs in baseball parks. For anyone else, that shift could spell doom. But as someone who grew up with the Beatles and Elton on one hand, and Eminem and Blackstreet on the other, he’s equally rooted in old-school melody and beat-derived new-century songwriting. In its best moments,   =  brings together those two worlds. If anything, it offers up the most definitive proof yet that he’s essentially become a one-man heir to the boy-band tradition of R&B grooves, overlapping harmonies and make-out-all-night erotic fantasies. You can practically imagine multiple Sheerans dancing and singing in unison on “Shivers,” “2Step,” and “Stop the Rain” which could well have been Backstreet B-sides. In “Overpass Graffiti,” he turns more melancholy and ambivalent about a severed old relationship (“The cards were stacked against us both/I will always love you for what it’s worth”) but never forgets to keep the music whooshing by. Sheeran the balladeer, the sensitive dude who blurts out his feelings after a pint or two, is never far away. As he demonstrated in his self-mocking cameo in 2019’s  Yesterday , he has a sense of humor about himself, and he still benefits from dropping idiosyncratic personal details and rom-com-style scenes into his songs. “Collide” is a listicle of odd romantic bonding moments (“Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo/And been to funerals in rented clothes/We drank your father’s whiskey when your grandma died”) and he manages to make his wedding proposal sound like something out of a Brit rom com in “First Times” (“You said, ‘Darling are you joking?’/And I just said please”).   Yet as genuinely in love as he appears, his devotional songs tend to bog down in generalized sentiments and gooier melodies. “Even at the times I’m miles away/You are always on my mind,” he serenades in “Leave Your Life,” while ”Joker & the Queen” and “Love in Slow Motion” (the latter one of the few tracks rooted in his Celtic-pop side) similarly border on the generic. You don’t  want  the guy to be bitter or miserable, but you also don’t necessarily want an ordinary candlelight-dinner refrain like the one in “Love in Slow Motion.” He’s also rapping less here than he ever has, with the result that his voice, especially his higher register, is sometimes less distinctive than it can be. That’s true on “Bad Habits,” which pulls him back back to his partying days and matches it with an appropriate after-hours-club beat–but also feels like it could be one of several other Ed clones who have infiltrated pop since his breakthrough. (We mean you, Lukas Graham, Alec Benjamin, and Sea Shanty Guy.) “Be Right Now,” the expansive track that closes  =,  wraps things up with another left-field twist. A rapturous EDM track co-produced by British multi-hyphenate FRED (who collaborated on many other tracks here), it’s utterly hypnotic. “Just stay here and be right now,” he pleads over its celestial sonics, sounding as close to Michael Stipe in outer space as he ever will. The track points to yet another new possible direction for Sheeran — especially as the increasingly messier world intrudes and he reaches the inevitable conclusion that love isn’t always enough to save the day.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/ed-sheeran-equals-review-1248652/
2021-10-29,Julyssa Lopez,3.5,Nicki Nicole,Nicki Nicole’s ‘Parte De Mí’ Is the Sound of an Artist Finding Her Voice,"Though the Argentine artist  Nicki Nicole  has a found a niche fusing silky R&B with hints of trap and reggaeton, her new album  Parte De Mí  opens in an unexpected way: with a gossamer piano ballad, dripping with longing and loneliness. The song is guided by her delicate, almost bruised vocals—which have drawn several  Billie Eilish  comparisons—and it quietly embodies the project’s goal of capturing the 21-year-old in full dimension, each side of her laid bare. The strategy here is to offer plenty of eclecticism, which undeniably shows off Nicki’s range but ends up sacrificing some cohesion in the process. Parte De Mí  marks Nicki’s second album and her debut on Sony Music Latin, which scooped her up in 2020. She started making music when she was just 19 and found massive success after uploading her tracks to YouTube, building off her association with trap in Argentina. The scene there has blown up in recent years and become a wellspring for labels looking for talent, despite the fact that it’s rife with uncomfortable patterns of appropriation from white rappers. Nicki has worked closely with the country’s top trap acts, including the go-to producer Bizarrap (he’s featured twice on the album), but it’s been hard to characterize the singer/rapper as a trap artist exactly. She’s used fluidity to her advantage throughout her career, employing it for things like a  collaboration  with the Uruguayan rockers No Te Va Gustar and a surprise freestyle at a recent  Tiny Desk .   She bounces between different sounds and different collaborators with ease: On “Toa La Vida,” she joins forces with the Puerto Rican rapper Mora, who’s aching tone carries an emotional weight that’s made songs, such as  “Volando,”  massive hits. She switches things up completely for  “Sabe,”  an undeniably catchy track with Rauw Alejandro that takes full advantage of how effortlessly the two of them can handle up-tempo beats. But although versatility would seem to be Nicki’s biggest asset, dipping in and out of genres sometimes makes for  Parte De Mí ’s less interesting moments. Coincidentally, trap-oriented sounds, like on “Tengo To,” get a little lost in the mix; a reggae-inspired track with Dread Mar-I and Bizarrap also falls flat. She achieves the most when she finds compelling ways into her delivery and unique style of phrasing. “Si Vos Me Lo Pedis”and “Perdido” are chances for her to belt out her choruses a little more, something she does with confidence. “Pensamos” with the Chilean singer  Mon Laferte , replicates some of the understated prettiness of the opener, but Nicki adds dimension by speeding up her flow without ever launching into full rap verses. It’s an inspired moment on the album, and more importantly, a sign of her finding her voice.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/nicki-nicole-parte-de-mi-1250061/
2021-10-29,Jon Dolan,3.5,The War On Drugs,The War on Drugs Invent Indie Yacht Rock,"Adam Granduciel, the main man behind  the War on Drugs , is a decent songwriter, a passable singer, and a good musician. But what he and the band really excel at is a kind of indie-rock interior design: politely anthemic middlebrow guitar romanticism that drifts and builds gorgeously, luxuriating in cozy abstraction and mutable emotion, expansive yet homey, with every inch of space giving off a warm, clean, tastefully lived-in feel. It’s a vibe that’s worked well for the War on Drugs, whose first LP in more than four years has been one of 2021’s most anticipated rock releases.  Granduciel’s holy trinity is Dylan, Petty, and Springsteen — this is a guy who named his first son Bruce. On  I Don’t Live Here Anymore,  he really goes all in on his retro-rock fantasy, with sparkling synths and booming drums just as prominent as autumnal jangle. In his nostalgic utopia, the commercial categories that defined the Reagan years have eroded into a mass of vague, happy memory, so the neon-tinted elegy “Change” suggests Don Henley’s “The Boys of Summer” with R.E.M.’s Peter Buck on guitar and Bruce Hornsby on piano. “I Don’t Wanna Wait” is even more enticing, evoking Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight” colored with ambient drones, as if Brian Eno had produced it, before morphing into something like Bob Dylan, if he’d tried to write a song that ripped off John Waite or Lou Gramm. And if you want to hear what it’d sound like if Bryan Adams had ever taken a shot at Springsteen-style working-class fatalism, “Old Skin” has you covered. The results come very close to arriving at a kind of indie yacht-rock — smooth but sad, rustic and ruffled, yet chill and pristine. Call it pontoon-rock.    As its title suggests,  I Don’t Live Here Anymore  is a record that often dwells on moving on (and out) after the end of a relationship. Granduciel lays out that theme most majestically on the title track. The music suggests he might have been thinking of Kim Carnes’ “Bette Davis Eyes,” or perhaps Def Leppard’s “Hysteria,” and the lyrics are a pastiche of Dylan quotes; Granduciel sings about being a “creature void of form” and dancing “to Desolation Row.” Lyrically, the album’s sentiments of change and loss, “running and returning,” and loose romantic ends doomed to remain untied are very  Blood on the Tracks  — that is, if Dylan  had released that masterpiece in 1985, instead of 1975, with Dave Stewart or Mutt Lange producing.  As a songwriter, Granduciel can’t quite fill shoes that big. But when he steps aside and War on Drugs stretch out — piling on acoustic filigree and crisp leads on “Harmonia’s Dream,” for instance, or zoning out heroically during the anxiety-shedding folk rock of “Occasional Rain” — they create a rare world of bliss that’s a great place to kill some time.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/war-on-drugs-i-dont-live-here-anymore-1247389/
2021-11-03,Will Dukes,3,Megan Thee Stallion,Megan Thee Stallion Rides a Sugar High on ‘Something For the Hotties’,"Megan Thee Stallion  is a lithe clotheshorse of a wordsmith whose lyricall bread and butter is commanding men to pleasure her. Never mind that none of them, as depicted in her catchy, think-piece-dominating songs, ever truly satisfy her; it’s just thrilling to hear one of the game’s sharpest MC’s come up with endlessly clever ways to describe her Carrie Bradshaw-esque sexual hijinks. In the end, Megan always comes out on top. Something for Thee Hotties: From Thee Archives , her latest mixtape makes good on the ratchet anthems she’s been mainlining  for the last five years (every sexy nurse this Halloween likely had a Meg caption somewhere on her IG). But there’s a deluge of illicit sumptuousness here, like too much Devil’s food cake. And, over the course of 21 tracks—mostly freestyles and unreleased cuts from the prolific rapper’s vaults —it feels like one big delectable but ultimately excessive sugar high.   Opener “Tuned In Freestyle” finds Megan gliding over a jittery Miami-bass-invoking track, spitting salacious couplets like, “Hot girl shit, never let ’em cool off/Make him do what I say, he my voodoo doll/Backshots, balcony, we don’t care who saw.” The brazenness of her bars is jaw dropping. And you see why she’s probably the only rapper who can, impromptu, wreck a booth, then have her catalog celebrated in the syllabi of prominent Black feminists.   Likewise, the self-explanatory “Eat It” brims with empowering lines that seem to deemphasize the “how to please your man in the sack” pointers posed in so many magazines geared toward women. Meg, over punchy bass, chuckles, “How many times have I heard that somebody last long?/These niggas ain’t lastin’ a minute/How many times have I heard that a nigga was big but dick as small as an egg-shaker?” Her lyrics might feel emasculating to some men. That’s just a sign, though, that the patriarchy is as fragile as their egos. But if this is “Hot Nerd Fall,” we need a bit more of the “nerd” factor from the self-confessed anime aficionado. And songs like the dismal “Warning,” with its sluggish 808s-driven backdrop and weary PornHub-category tropes feel superfluous next to more dynamic, idiosyncratic hits from her oeuvre, like “Savage,” with its effortless high-low dichotomies. Ditto for the uninspired “Outta Town Freestyle,” which lacks the pop and verve (and brainy “Onomatopoeia” reference) of her scathing “Stalli (Freestyle).” Clearly Megan is living it up, and pushing the culture forward for good measure. But with too much turn up, this hot girl might start to leave us a bit cold.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/megan-thee-stallion-something-for-the-hotties-1252117/
2021-11-04,Rob Sheffield,5,"Jonny Greenwood,Radiohead,Thom Yorke",Radiohead’s Finest Hour Sounds Better Than Ever,"There are some takes that don’t pass the test of time. For centuries, the human race believed that the sun revolved around the earth. We all got over that. People thought tomatoes were fatal to eat, leeches were quality health care, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Read anything published about cocaine in the 1970s and you will find the word “non-addictive.” And when  Radiohead  released  Amnesiac  in the summer of 2001, many fans thought it was infinitely better than  Kid A . It rocked harder. Sharper tunes. Wider emotional range. The ultimate one-two punch: Radiohead made two space-rock masterpieces at the same sessions, and they saved the best stuff for the sequel. Over the years, the  Kid A l egend just keeps growing — Radiohead’s most legendary classic. But  Amnesiac  has become weirdly underrated, overshadowed by its more famous sibling, to the chagrin of diehard Amnesiacs. Radiohead revisit these sessions in  Kid A Mnesia , a stunning collection making the case for both albums as twin halves of the same musical statement.  Kid A Mnesia  tells the whole insane story over three discs — both original albums plus  Kid Amnesiae , a collection of outtakes, B-sides, unreleased experiments. It’s the sound of crazed geniuses running wild in the studio, ready to try anything. Result: two classics, with plenty of brilliant music left over.   The premise was simple: wildly successful rock stars decide to rip it up and start again, trading their guitars for synthesizers they don’t quite know how to play. As  Kid Amnesiae   shows, they were overflowing with ideas, with a “what does this button do?” spirit. And in classic Radiohead style, they drove each other mad, doing every tiny detail the hard way. As  Thom Yorke  confessed in  Rolling Stone , “I made everyone’s life almost impossible.” One of the new highlights: “If You Say the Word,” a previously unheard gem that got shelved. ( Jonny Greenwood  dismissed it as “too tasteful.”) Yet it’s Radiohead at peak strength, with Thom Yorke contemplating different kinds of betrayal over eerie synths. “Follow Me Around” is a cult favorite that’s never had a proper studio release, though they’ve touched on it a few times live — a paranoid acoustic kiss-off that dates back to the  OK Computer  sessions, with Yorke sneering, “See you on the way back down.” It’s hard to imagine any other band letting songs this great slip away. There’s retooled versions of lost B-sides like “Fast Track” and “Fog.”  Kid Amnesiae  has echoes of the original albums — the “Motion Picture Soundtrack” harp glissandos, the “How To Disappear Completely” strings — like fragments of a nightmare you can’t shake off. “Pulk/Pull (True Love Waits Version)” is a full-on electro-glitch version of the longtime highlight — one of Radiohead’s most beloved songs—though it didn’t get an official studio release until they revived it in 2016 for  A Moon Shaped Poo l. This is one they should have released at the time. It whirs with ominous synths and Fender Rhodes piano, a la “Everything In Its Right Place.” “The Morning Bell” was the only tune from the sessions that appeared on both albums, so it’s fitting to hear a third approach on  Kid Amnesiae , an instrumental full of mournful carnival organ. Kid A  and  Amnesiac  were the first big-deal rock albums of the Napster era, so fans around the world already knew much of the material from live MP3s. When  Kid A  dropped in October 2000, it was a mystery why Radiohead seemed to be holding back their strongest new songs. No “Knives Out”? No “You and Whose Army?” No “Pyramid Song,” which we all knew as “Egyptian Song”? The arguments just heated up when  Amnesiac  dropped in the summer of 2001.  Amnesiac  was tougher, more punk, flaunting the guitar power of Jonny Greenwood and Ed O’Brien. One highlight, “I Might Be Wrong,” hijacked the Allman Brothers, while “Knives Out” sounded like every single Smiths song thrown into a juicer. While  Kid A  went abstract,  Amnesiac  showed off the rock & roll masters Radiohead had always been, however reluctantly.   These days  Amnesiac  is ripe for reappraisal. Last year, in  Rolling Stone ’s comprehensive poll of the  500 Greatest Albums of All Time , the voters put  Kid A  in the Top Twenty, while  Amnesiac  didn’t even make the cut. (The list also had  OK Computer ,  The Bends , and  In Rainbows .) Ironically,  Kid A  sits on the list right behind Kendrick Lamar’s  To Pimp a Butterfly , which samples “Pyramid Song” from  Amnesiac . The second half often gets reduced to a mere footnote in the  Kid A  story —  Bridesmaid A . But it’s a landmark in its own right.  The whole  Kid A Mnesia  project looked like a commercial disaster waiting to happen back then. But both these albums were gigantic commercial blockbusters — hell, you could go ahead and call them pop hits.  Kid A  debuted at Number One in October 2000, and it turned out to be the right ice-age-coming soundtrack to the dystopian endgame of Y2K, as the Supreme Court blocked the state of Florida from counting votes and awarded the presidency to the guy who lost the election. It was the start of a new century full of “this is really happening” disasters.  Kid A Mnesia  isn’t just a monument of Radiohead’s bravest, boldest music — it’s a tribute to keeping the creative fires burning even in the coldest of times.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/radioheads-kid-a-mnesia-1251752/
2021-11-04,Rob Sheffield,4,Abba,The First New ABBA Album in 40 Years Was Worth the Wait,"Nearly 40 years ago,  Abba  were in the studio for one last time, to cut a tragic ballad called “The Day Before You Came.” They knew this was goodbye; both couples in the group had finalized their divorces. Agnetha Fältskog recited a bleak tale of total emotional isolation, words scripted by her ex-husband, doing her vocals in a darkened studio with all the lights out. It was the last thing they ever recorded. A splendidly melodramatic finale for this most melodramatic of pop groups. And that—as far as the world knew—was that for Abba. Until now. So how the hell did this happen? The Swedish super troupers ride again with  Voyage , and there’s never been a comeback story like this one: all four original members of a great pop band, reuniting after 40 years apart, with all their powers intact. This album would be a one-of-a-kind historic event even if the songs blew—but it’s vintage Abba, on par with their classic 1970s run. It evokes the days when the Norse gods ruled the radio, combining two of the Seventies’ hottest trends: heartbreak and sequin-studded pantsuits.    For Bjorn, Benny, Anna-Frid and Agnetha, their last album was the 1981 gem  The Visitors , a frosty electro concept album of synth-pop paranoia and mid-life despair. Their tunes were as cheery and bouncy on the surface as prime Elton John, making them the world’s best-selling act, but loaded with Leonard Cohen levels of angst. Who else would put a song called “Disillusion” on their  first  album?  But since then, the Abba legacy has just kept booming. Each generation falls in love with their hits all over again. They helped invent goth—you can’t imagine Joy Division or the Cure or Berlin-era Bowie without “S.O.S.” They taught Kurt Cobain how to write hooks. If the pop-star scale goes from “obscure” to “legendary,” Abba zoom right off the chart and land on “Cher tribute album, right after the scene in * Mamma Mia 2 * where she steps out of a helicopter to belt ‘Fernando.’” Voyage  piles on the tragic drama—it’s a whole album of “The Winner Takes It All,” without any “Mamma Mia” or “Take a Chance On Me.” They were always in love with adult gloom, going back to the divorced-mom power chords of “Knowing Me, Knowing You” or “Hey Hey Helen.” As Pete Townshend  told Rolling Ston e in 1982, when he shocked the world by coming out as an Abba fan, “Abba was one of the first big international bands to actually deal with sort of middle-aged problems in their songwriting.” And that was in their younger days. Now that they’re all past 70, they haven’t exactly lost their appetite for emotional-crisis soundtracks.  As always, Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson write the songs, but now they leave the singing to the ladies, Faltskog and Anna-Frid Lyngstad. They put  Voyage  together while plotting their 2022 “virtual” live residency in London. These concerts won’t have mere holograms—instead, they’ve got what Benny and Bjorn call “Abba-tars.”  “Don’t Shut Me Down” is the prize of the new tunes: Agnetha prowls outside her ex’s home, waiting for the right moment to knock on his door for the first time in years and seduce him. It’s a completely over-the-top scenario—just Abba’s specialty—in the style of their Seventies disco bangers, complete with “Dancing Queen” piano frills. Agnetha takes satisfaction in noticing that her ex hasn’t redecorated since she left, because “These rooms were witness to our love / My tantrums and increasing frustration.” (Could there be a more Abba lyric? No, there could not.)   “No Doubt About It” goes for Eighties synth glitz, while “Just a Notion” is a frisky Seventies leftover—a  Voulez Vous  outtake with vocals recorded in 1978. The fact that vocal tracks from four decades ago fit seamlessly with the new ones—it’s a tribute to Abba’s obsessive machine-tooled precision. “I Could Be That Woman” is a lavish ballad where a woman watches her estranged lover cuddle someone named Tammy—it turns out to be his dog. The couple argues (“You say you’ve had it and you say ‘screw you’”), while the dog watches and judges them. The dog might be the most emotionally stable character on the album. But like all the couples in these songs, this one has a long, tortured history with no happy ending in sight. You can’t say Abba don’t stay true to their vision. It wouldn’t be an authentic Abba album without some stomach-churning filler, so beware before you brave the Christmas ditty “Little Things.” But otherwise,  Voyage  reflects how far these four have traveled, musically and emotionally. There’s no embarrassing attempt to get up to date with the bops the kids are into these days, a compliment to their integrity. Instead of chasing trends, they stick to the classic sound they perfected years ago, the sound that has kept influencing modern pop ever since. As they once sang, the history book on the shelf is always repeating itself. When the woman in “Don’t Shut Me Down” knocks on that guy’s door, her greeting is, “I would believe it’s fair to say you look bewildered.” And indeed, it’s a surprise to have these Swedes back in the game. But it’s a bigger, sweeter surprise that they returned so full of musical vitality. All these years after “Waterloo,” Abba still refuse to surrender.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/abba-voyage-1251755/
2021-11-05,Jon Dolan,3.5,"Nathaniel Rateliff,Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats",Nathaniel Rateliff’s Throwbacks Wear Well on ‘The Future’,"It’s been six years since  Nathaniel Rateliff  and the Night Sweats electrified  The Tonight Show  with their brawny rave-up “S.O.B.,” delivering a scorching performance that launched one of the more unlikely breakout stars of the viral-sensation era. Rateliff was a burly middle-aged guy from Colorado whom Jimmy Fallon had stumbled across via a YouTube clip, and the Nights Sweats’ rustic look suggested they might feel more at home hanging out at Big Pink in 1968. But the command of retro-soul they displayed on their self-titled 2015 debut and its 2018 follow-up,  Tearing at the Seams , was undeniable, partly because Rateliff worked a little Leonard Cohen-style introspect into his Ray Charles-inscribed belting.   That mix of Sixties groove workouts and Seventies singer-songwriter truth-seeking pays off on their third album,  The Future . The title track kicks off sounding like the Bob Dylan of  Desire  if he’d recorded that album at Muscle Shoals. Good-natured vamps like “Something Ain’t Right” and “Survivor” strive to find rays of hope in our garbage times, musically hulking out with swelling horns and deliberate, nuanced muscle, as if the Night Sweats are a gang of bar buddies patting Nathaniel on the back as he decides to man up and take on reality. “Gotta sing a lot of soul to know how to feel it,” he offers on “Something Ain’t Right,” an ode to the cathartic power of making music.   That’s a good theme for this band, who sound inspired even when they’re merely channeling influences. The Night Sweats often suggest a more wide-open, somewhat jam-band-y Rocky Mountain version of the Dap-Kings’ funk-soul attack, and you can imagine  The Future  appealing equally to fans of Dave Matthews and Amy Winehouse. Their lived-in versatility is always impressive — from the gale-force Van Morrison gusto of “Love Me Til I’m Gone,” to the Funk Brothers pulse that pushes “Love Don’t,” to the low-key Bill Withers-style romance of “Baby I Got Your Number.” Rateliff’s ability to go from conversational coffeehouse mutter to roadhouse bluster has a similar dynamic command, and it makes the music feel urgent even when his lyrics don’t rise above well-intentioned bromides; the heart-yanking gospel grandeur of “Face Down in the Moment” deserves something a little more specific than “every moment that you wait now is a moment slipped away,” and “I’m On Your Side” lands its search for solace on lines like “there’s a chance to see if we just open up our eyes.” If Rateliff just saw himself as a history-loving belter riffling through received idioms, it wouldn’t really matter. But he’d clearly like to say something with his music, and the singer-songwriter side of his talent doesn’t always come into focus. Still, unlike plenty of guys in hats and beards who’d like to make meaning, he never sounds self-serious, pompous, or sanctimonious. He’s too generous for that, a crowd-pleaser at heart.",https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/nathaniel-rateliff-future-1253287/
