2022-03-29,Max Heilman,8,"SPRING 2022 ISSUE,FROM THE MAGAZINE,METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Meshuggah Marinate in Their 'Immutable' Sound,,"Meshuggah  offer more than consistency, having unveiled new facets of their polyrhythmic avant-metal throughout their career. Whether it was  Nothing  introducing eight-string guitars in 2002, or  obZen 's standard-setting technicality in 2008, the Swedish titans have tirelessly carved out their niche in heavy music. In this unique situation, Meshuggah's eighth album Immutable doesn't have to reinvent the wheel… Meshuggah  are  the wheel.    Nearly six years after  The Violent Sleep of Reason , opener ""Broken Cog"" effectively reintroduces Meshuggah's unmistakable tenets, gradually forming a solid backbeat and ominous leads around staccato tom-toms and cavernous chugs. It's a slow-burning start, but the mesmerising punishment remains intact once Jens Kidman's moody mutterings turn to his throaty scream amid the violent tremolo guitars and double kick drums of ""The Abysmal Eye."" Both tracks spotlight drummer Tomas Haake as the ultimate groove master, meticulously guiding the mad-scientist fretwork of guitarists Mårten Hagström and Fredrik Thordendal.    Meshuggah riffs are almost magical in their catchiness and complexity. Cuts like ""Ligature Marks"" conceal a rhythmic labyrinth under an infectious structure, with each twist deepening an immersive wall of sound. ""The Faultless"" achieves a similar effect, subverting the four-on-the-floor intro without overturning the subtone pulse. Speaking of subtone, these two songs highlight  Immutable 's greatest flex: Dick Lövgren's bass tone. His performances miraculously make the grimy nine-string guitar tone even grimier, clearly distinguishing 'heavy' from 'Meshuggah heavy.'    Any guitarist can tune low and spam their bottom string, but it's quite another matter to spend ""Black Cathedral"" sinking into a hellscape of filth-encrusted guitar strains. Even without drums, the crushing dissonance rivals extreme experimenters like Portal. Meshuggah's ambient side reappears at various junctures, notably on ""They Move Below."" The song's first two-and-a-half minutes comprise some of Meshuggah's most euphoric textures, making the main riff that much more devastating when it drops. Instrumental cuts like these clearly manifest Meshuggah's disregard for orthodoxy in favour of contorted protractions of blunt force trauma.    Thrashy tracks like ""Light the Shortening Fuse"" also have an inexplicably transcendental aura. Meshuggah's ideas progress fluidly, untethered by verses or choruses. To that effect, ""Phantoms"" subverts the generic prog-core breakdown with an amorphous tapestry of string bends and tom-toms. It's not about mosh parts, but ravishing vibes. Zoning out to the atonal guitar solos and chaotic rhythms of ""God He Sees in Mirrors"" feels like getting sucked into a wormhole of ferocious stupor.    Though ""Kaleidoscope"" won't surprise anyone with the sum of its parts, Meshuggah's chemistry makes the familiar fascinating. Kidman knows exactly where to place each syllable of his lyrics within destructive yet meticulous arrangements. Eerie motifs gliding over the chopped-up rampage of ""I Am That Thirst"" isn't groundbreaking for Meshuggah, but no one else has yet to achieve such a vital ebb and flow of barbaric melee. In this way, a cut like ""Armies of the Preposterous"" can live up to its name in baffling aggression without trying too hard.    For all its frenetic bombshells,  Immutable 's success ultimately lies in its attention to detail. Closing track ""Past Tense"" feels no less thought-out than its counterparts in delicate soundscapes and harmonic interplay. Meshuggah haven't returned to impress anyone but themselves. This is the music they like playing. It just happens to sound unlike anything else in metal. After 30-plus years in the game, Meshuggah have neither quelled their thirst for tectonic frenzy nor dried their well of dexterous musicality.

2022-03-29,Adam Feibel,7,"FROM THE MAGAZINE,SPRING 2022 ISSUE,PUNK,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",PUP's Company Loves Misery on 'THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND',,"PUP  have always known that misery loves company. While their music exists in the same space as the type of posi-punk that promises any loser or screwup can find salvation in beer-soaked power chords, they've taken on a different philosophy. For PUP, it's not really about feeling better — it's about crawling through the miles of mud and shit together.    The Toronto foursome basically perfected that idea of triumphant commiseration on their third album, 2019's  Morbid Stuff , which earned them critical acclaim, their late-night debut and a Juno Award. You might think that getting up on a stage and airing their grievances to swaths of sweaty, adoring fans night after night could help them come to better terms with the various anxieties, neuroses and self-destructive proclivities they sing at the top of their lungs, but that wouldn't really be PUP. Instead,  THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND , the group's fourth album, continues their arc with an even sharper nosedive into existential dread, hopelessness and total calamity.    When singer Stefan Babcock accidentally-on-purpose plays a sour note during ""Four Chords"" and then mutters a contemptful ""fuck,"" it's a moment that sums up the PUP mindset just about as well as any lyric could. Screw up, curse yourself, and move on. Later, play the tape back for further analysis. Repeat as necessary. ""It's honestly starting to seem like an art / How we keep tearing ourselves apart,"" Babcock sings in ""Grim Reaping,"" picking apart these acts of self-judgment and internal doomsaying amid a clash of guitars that sort of brings At the Drive-In to mind. ""I've got a bit of a complex / In case that wasn't clear from the last three sessions,"" he snarls in the thrash-metally ""Waiting,"" a wink to those who have sung along with their shared gripes and groans over the course of the band's previous three records. ""Lately I've started to feel like I'm slowly dying / And if I'm being real, I don't even mind,"" he ruminates in the choppy and poppy ""Totally Fine,"" reluctantly accepting whatever comes his way.     Fittingly, PUP's approach to their craft as musicians has gotten more streamlined while simultaneously becoming even more unpredictable. You've got all the catchy, fast-paced melodies, big singalongs, and  ooh-ooh s and  whoa-oa s that you could want in a PUP record, along with even more of the kind of outrageous metal riffing you'd hear spilling out of the garage of the smelliest kids at your high school. Meanwhile, they sneak in Latin rhythms, a blues-rock solo, church-like harmonies, and lyrics written from the POV of a heartbroken robot and an old, neglected guitar. They've added piano, synths, horns and more, which are not just a more diverse array of musical instruments but also an expanded arsenal of agents of chaos. And you'll hear vocal features by Sarah Tudzin of Illuminati Hotties, Kathryn McCauhey of NOBRO, Melanie St-Pierre of Casper Skulls and Erik Paulson of Remo Drive, lending several more voices to back up Babcock's patented nasally shout. It's all held together by the studio work of Peter Katis, who's applied a thick coating of dirt and grit that covers even their sweetest melodies.    The mess and chaos is clearly intentional. If PUP are going to write music that's beautiful, they have to do their best to also make it ugly. And while it's not a word you might normally think to use to describe PUP's music, there is quite a bit of beauty here. ""Robot Writes a Love Song"" has one of the best choruses they've ever written (it's that first one, if you're wondering), even if its central analogy doesn't hold up quite as well as  ""Matilda""  (which has its own pretty chorus!). ""Habits"" has a swinging rhythm, strong dynamics and crafty instrumentation, along with one of Babcock's truest lyrics: ""I've gotta change these habits."" The band play more quietly and ruminatively than ever on the slow-burning ""Cutting Off the Corners""; it's far from their best song, but it's a great way of showing that they've got another gear in them. They show similar restraint in ""Relentless,"" where they pull back for the choruses instead of going for another all-out anthem as Babcock delivers another signature line: ""Fuck all the dread / It's endless.""     All the while, PUP sound like they're on the verge of a total implosion (or a full-blown meltdown, if you will). They're not alone: There's plenty of commiseration going around in today's punk-rock scene. A band like Drug Church will attack their problems with bludgeoning force, while someone like Jeff Rosenstock will vent his anger with gleeful abandon. Rather than direct their rage in outward directions, PUP prefer to burn an effigy of themselves. It's punk rock for people who are prone to self-criticism, self-sabotage and self-loathing, and who can sing along with others who are guilty of the same frustrations and self-destructive behaviours with the knowledge that it's not just them. Even with their dour outlooks, they can rely on the rousing chants of big, fun pop-punk choruses to turn it into a good time.     Yet for all of its big, fun pop-punk choruses,  THE UNRAVELING  doesn't always feel like a rallying cry. The record's recurring theme is the band cosplaying as a corporate entity (giving the adage of ""misery loves company"" a double meaning, in this case), and with it comes a bit of unfocused satire that directs its criticism not as much toward the system of capitalism and consumerism and more so toward random passersby. By the time they close things out with the supremely noisy closing act ""PUPTHEBAND Inc. is Filing for Bankruptcy,"" you're more likely to be left not with a feeling of fun-filled camaraderie but with an alienating sense of bitterness. For all of their negativity, the best PUP songs remind fans that they're not the only ones going through this. Here, it feels at times like they're marooning themselves on a desert island and their only goal is survival. You want to root for these guys, so their commitment to self-sabotage can be hard to stomach. If  Morbid Stuff  taught us that anger can be liberating, this record teaches us that anger can also be limiting.     What it shows, though, is that PUP are, of course, not infallible. In fact, their whole career is based on the notion that they are extremely fallible. They're just as susceptible to being subsumed by cynicism as anyone else — and given their well-documented political awareness, social conscience and, well, mental not-so-greatness, they're probably more susceptible than the average person. And let's face it, the years since  Morbid Stuff  have not been especially kind. The band looked at a time when war, division and greed are in a bull market while hope, kindness and positivity are in the toilet, and they wrote a record that reflects that reality with all the nastiness they figure it deserves. If there's anything to be said about  THE UNRAVELING , it's that PUP have remained true to themselves.

2022-03-30,Bruno Coulombe,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",P'tit Belliveau Proves His Musical Fusion Is No Fluke on 'Un homme et son piano',,"Acadian artist  P'tit Belliveau  caught the Canadian music scene completely off guard with 2020 debut album  Greatest Hits Vol. 1 , a surrealist collection of humorous songs wrapped in a strange country-electro hybrid. Pushing his candour one step further, follow-up  Un homme et son piano  showcases a wider range of influences, while confirming that that first record wasn't a fluke.      The task at hand was significant for Jonah Richard Guimond, a former construction worker-turned-quirky music star.  Greatest Hits Vol. 1  was so unconventional in its approach to songwriting — both cheesy and sensitive, and marked by an irresistible exuberance — that it could easily have been perceived as an oddity from a self-taught musician just fooling around. In a sense, Guimond had to prove that that success was legitimate and that there was more to it than funny lines about blowing your income tax return at Taco Bell.      Of course, P'tit Belliveau could have stuck with the same recipe and released a  Greatest Hits Vol. 2 . Instead, he takes the best elements of his debut — the naiveté, his knack for crafting instantly memorable melodies, the richness of production — and pushes into a more expansive musical universe, one that draws on 1980s power ballads, hip-hop, country, funk, traditional folk, video game music, and more.      These various influences cohabit with each other in something of an organized chaos, often within the same song. The eclectic ""Demain"" is a great example: starting off with a syncopated beat paired with hip-hop flow, the song transitions into a pastoral bridge that echoes the progressive folk textures of 1970s acts like Harmonium.    It would be a bit of an overstatement to say that P'tit Belliveau explores different musical territory on this new album. However, what has changed since  Greatest Hits Vol. 1  is the confidence shown in pairing his surreal humour with more ""serious"" music. Instrumental ""Lupines"" is a heartfelt homage to traditional Acadian folk, while the conclusion of ""RRSP/Grosse pièce"" is brilliantly orchestrated.      The biggest achievement of  Un homme et son piano  is the seamless blend between live instrument sonorities and the digital world of the keyboard. Tracks like ""Des affaires vont jamais changer"" and ""Meteghan River"" bring to mind an old Casio piano with their mechanical drum beats and cheesy synth sounds. Still, both are filled with instrumental details that reveal a complex approach to production, whether it's a fuzzy electric guitar or a surprise fiddle fill.      Elsewhere, the Nova Scotian showcases his ability to transform the most down-to-earth topics into hymns. Opener ""J'aimerais d'avoir un John Deere"" is a jubilant power ballad that channels the arena rock of Foreigner, but with lyrics about owning a tractor and using it to plant seeds and feed everyone. Built on a powerful crescendo, the song features an airy choir in the chorus, an unexpected twist that gives it a ""We Are the World"" feel, but with rural poetry.      Compared to P'tit Belliveau's past work, there's a little less room on  Un homme et son piano  for the kind of nonchalance that prompted comparisons to Mac DeMarco. But there's still plenty of infectious hooks, as evidenced by the playful ""Retourner chu nous"" with silly keyboards that serve as a reminder of how Guimond is incapable of taking himself too seriously.      Just like his hybrid French and English lyrics,  P'tit Belliveau's  music exists in the margins of two worlds: not totally absurd, but never really serious either, and this is what makes it so refreshing.

2022-03-30,Wesley McLean,7,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Phife Dawg's 'Forever' Captures the Late Artist's Warm, Wise Spirit",,"​In November 2015,  a Tribe Called Quest  celebrated the 25th anniversary of their debut album  People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm  with a performance of ""Can I Kick It?"" on  The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon , backed by the Roots. The first television performance in over 15 years from the reunited  Phife Dawg , Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White marked a turning point in the group's history; not only was it the night they set their differences aside to begin recording again, but also their last live performance together.    ​Phife Dawg, born Malik Taylor, tragically  passed away  in March 2016 due to complications stemming from his battle with diabetes, a disease he'd been fighting for over 25 years. Shortly after his passing, the surviving members of Tribe announced they had been working on new music with Phife in the time since their  Tonight Show  performance, and that they would be finishing and releasing it in his honour. ​ We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service  — the group's first project since 1998's  The Love Movement  — was released in late 2016, defying all odds by living up to almost two decades-worth of hype.    It was a phenomenal offering that comfortably bookended what is arguably the most consistent and complete discography in hip-hop history. It was clear that despite the turmoil and resulting hiatus, the group's chemistry hadn't faltered, and Phife specifically showcased that he was as charismatic and vocally versatile as ever. With  Forever , it becomes clear that this time apart was pivotal in Phife's journey to reach that reunion.    ​ Forever 's 13 tracks tell an insightful and personal oral history of Tribe's hiatus from Phife's perspective. It's an album that helps fill in the blanks — not through a detailed breakdown of the 20-year hiatus, but through Phife sharing his experiences, and showcasing the growth and maturation that came with them. The album tells Phife's story as a family man, navigating his battle with diabetes and coping with the bitterness and disappointment that he felt in the wake of the dissolution of a Tribe Called Quest, among other things.    ​Phife's demeanour on the mic has always been characterized by the lovable warmth that he possesses. Whether it be his lighthearted bars on tracks like ""Buggin' Out,"" or in more solemn moments like his heartfelt verse on ""Stressed Out,"" he has always been incredibly personable in his lyrics and delivery, his verses feeling akin to a close friend cracking jokes and telling stories. On  Forever , Phife is dealing with illness, a disdain for the Tribe situation and his relationship with mortality, yet he still maintains that warmth and positivity. Despite how tumultuous things seem, he's only come out wiser and grateful for everything that he does have.    ​Throughout the album, Phife raps about taking care of his family, his love for his wife, lamenting the loss of friend and collaborator J. Dilla and, most affectingly, sharing his hope for the future. It's incredibly touching to hear that he was so optimistic about what was to come, whether the prospect of finally getting to live life without dialysis, or celebrating the new lease on life he felt when receiving his kidney replacement. This is a very mature album that does away with genre tropes and opts for authenticity and emotion.    ​It's rare for a posthumous release to not only live up up to the artist's previous work, but properly capture their aura and spirit in the way that  Forever  manages to. Despite being mainly comprised of demos and unfinished tracks,  Forever  serves as a perfect memorial for Phife. It encapsulates exactly who he was, highlights what fans have always loved about him and gives them new insight into the man that he'd grown to be. Not only is it a beautiful tribute to Phife, but it serves as a loving reminder that his music, his spirit and his impact will truly last forever.

2022-03-31,Luke Pearson,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Kellarissa Crafts Stirring Electric Hymnals on 'Voice Leading',,"The English translation of Vancouverite Larissa Loyva's solo moniker  Kellarissa  — Finnish for ""in the basement"" — has proven a fitting one. While less obvious and front-facing than a foyer full of household names, the basement is necessary, foundational, and may extend further than you know. If there's a party, it's where the cool people hang out, the regulars who know what's up.    You know Loyva would be there, having recently played in How to Dress Well and Destroyer's touring bands, as well as hip projects of scenes past like Piano, Fake Tears, and the Choir Practice. Interestingly, it's this choral background that may be the key to  Voice Leading,  her churchy, retro-futuristic fourth album of self-described femme psyche electronica. More experimental than previous efforts, it's still full of painstaking harmonies and sonorous tones made to reverberate in vaulted ceilings. It's easily her most interesting and accomplished work, a synthwave-adjacent collection of balladry and strange incantation that builds on all her previous releases.    As the title suggests, Loyva's vocals are front and centre here. Resonant, controlled, and clear as '80s stemware, they're often harmonically stacked too, upping the focus even more. It can make things feel a bit cold and impersonal at times, but once you find your way in, a refreshingly artist-first album emerges. Opening with a diaristic, almost confessional spoken word intro on ""Exposition,"" we quickly move on to a section of ghostly, chanted harmonies — all before the first bass stab arrives. It's an intriguing start that sets the tone for the unexpected things to come.    The vocals are really only half of what's going on here. Like its cover eagerly communicates,  Voice Leading  is drenched in lush, '80s-style synth work. Pads, stabs, crystalline arpeggios — it's all here, and, along with the choral, often chant-like stylings of Loyva's vocals, the album often conjures up some kind of neon electro church, with John Carpenter on ministerial duties and Vangelis as patron saint. It's definitely a cinematic listen, with a distinct lack of emphasis on beats, so don't expect to dance  too  much. Although previously-released single ""Bad Influence"" is a standout exception, a storming electro banger full of synth leads and buzzing vocoders that's over too soon.    Generally,  Voice Leading  strikes a good balance between its artier and more overt pop leanings. ""Sphinx,"" perhaps the most straightforwardly tuneful song here, features a chorus that wouldn't be out of place in any sophisticated synthpop of today. It's followed quickly by ""To the Wind At Morn,"" a beatless vocal track that takes place over a single held synth note, a low-frequency anchor for Loyva's pitch-perfect harmonies. It's beautiful and interesting — like an Irish ballad by way of  Blade Runner  — but those with a more casual relationship with Kellarissa might come up confused.    This will easily resolve for the willing and patient however;  Voice Leading  is challenging and mature, trading in some of the immediacy of Loyva's earlier work for a scope and ambition that pays off nicely.

2022-03-31,Myles Tiessen,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Jamboree Push at Conscious and Conceptual Barriers on 'Life in the Dome',,"To decrypt  Jamboree 's  Life in the Dome  is to discover a melancholic tale of desolation. The sophomore release from the Winnipeg alt-rockers sees their misanthropic tendencies tumultuously wrestle with their desire for human connection.    A partial concept record,  Life in the Dome  revolves around the fictional story of a newly-elected mayor who builds a glass dome over the city, protecting and trapping the residents inside. A concept like this feels reminiscent of other records of alienation, like  The Wall , or hell, even that  Simpsons  movie. But here, Jamboree are delicate and less conspicuous than the more well-known works.  Life in the Dome  is less about the political motivations of the dome, or a commentary on xenophobia, but rather how living in isolated segregation affects the mental wellbeing of the city's inhabitants.    The equally dominant soundscape matches the heady concepts. Songs like ""The Dome"" and ""The Birds Are Chirping"" feature distorted, washed-out guitars that envelop the listener with euphoric power, while other tracks remain intimate and muted. Through mumbling vocals, buried in a swell of depressive jangle,  Life in the Dome  is a catchy and melodic expression of doom. A clear and ever-present '90s aesthetic prevails through the album's entirety, and blending with midwest emo motifs means Jamboree settle nicely into nostalgic, sad boy college rock.    Jamboree's intentions are expressed clearly on album opener ""The Snow,"" which captures the feelings of claustrophobia and detachment felt during unrelenting winter months. Mournful vocals emerge through a cacophony of swirling guitars, lamenting, ""I heard life is cyclical, but maybe it's a straight line."" Jamboree spend the entirety of ""The Snow"" playing with similarly straightforward lyrics that manage to capture universal feelings of alienation and anxiety. ""I know that you'll sit and watch me as I fucking drown, you clown"" is also just a great way to express dissatisfaction with someone.    The towering sonic volume in which Jamboree dabbles on ""The Snow"" is simultaneously intimate and dissociative. The meditative spoken-word tranquility carries the same emotive charge as the chaotic highs of squealing guitars and bombastic drums.     Life in the Dome  is filled with moments of quiet reflection and introspective melodies. ""Another Day"" plays with the downtrodden malaise of slowcore, and features an alluring slide guitar. At the same time, ""Quebec"" reflects on the high cost of university textbooks, trouble making rent and other financial stresses. However great and honest these moments are, Jamboree show their elite nature when exploring the raucous side of experimentation.    ""The Trees"" builds into a brilliant full-frontal assault of intertwining melodies and distorted guitar solos, and while ""Be True"" starts as a ""Say It Ain't So"" clone, it soon transforms into its own singular, hard-rocking hysteria. The nucleus of ""Walk"" is a complete breakdown of any reasonable melody, and Jamboree's inclination to follow their curiosity helps make  Life in the Dome  sound uniquely itself.    Jamboree are honest in both their lyrics and instrumentation. While the record may be about the life of people trapped inside a city,  Life in the Dome  feels more like a band trapped inside their own minds, fiercely creating art for sanity's sake.

2022-03-31,Alex Hudson,7,"MUSIC,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM",Red Hot Chili Peppers Rekindle Their Fire on 'Unlimited Love' ,,"Red Hot Chili Peppers  have had many different lineups over the years, but they only really sound like themselves when on-again-off-again guitarist  John Frusciante  is in the fold. That impression is reinforced by  Unlimited Love  — a sprawling, exciting album full of playful chemistry between four musicians who, yet again, bring out the best in one another.    The album has all the usual hallmarks of the Chili Peppers: goofy funk-rap gibberish ( ""Poster Child"" ), sunburnt grunge ballads ( ""Black Summer"" ), harmony-drenched name-dropping of California (""White Braids & Pillow Chair""), and cloud-scraping fretboard heroics on guitar (""The Great Apes"") and bass (""One Way Traffic""). Longtime super-producer  Rick Rubin  is back behind the boards after sitting an album out, and he helps the group lean into their classic, summery sound.    As nice as it is to hear RHCP back in their wheelhouse, they sound best when they pick up the energy and cut loose a little. ""Here Ever After"" is propelled by Chad Smith's pounding toms,  Flea 's dirty bass thrumming and Frusciante's ominous tones. The song has a gleefully silly pseudo-rap delivery that only  Anthony Kiedis  could pull off; same goes for the ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" flow of ""One Way Traffic."" Instant standout ""Aquatic Mouth Dance"" sounds like a fairly typical Chili Peppers funk jam (think ""Charlie"") until it spins off into an approximation of caterwauling New Orleans jazz in the giddy final passage. The climactic ""These Are the Ways"" begins slow but veers into bluesy hard rock; that explosive distortion returns on ""The Heavy Wing"" in a towering chorus sung entirely by Frusciante. The rave tones of ""Bastards of Light"" draw on the  solo electronic music Frusciante has been making in recent years , surpassing 2016's Danger Mouse-produced  The Getaway  as RHCP's most adventurous dalliance with synths.    Frusciante will likely get much of the credit for the band's reinvigorated sound. He's the thinking person's Chili Pepper, the one apologists will point to as the spiritual, sensitive soul to balance out the rest of band's horned-up goofiness. While there's no question that his sense of pop songcraft is perhaps the band's greatest strength, his bandmates turn in similarly strong performances here: see the way Flea walks his way through playful riffs on ""Watchu Thinkin'"" or how Smith propels the sighing ""White Braids & Pillow Chair"" to an unexpected country finale with his chug-a-lug beat. Frusciante has spoken about  approaching  Unlimited Love  without a sense of ego , and he often takes a backseat to let his bandmates rise to the occasion; he's more restrained with his vocal harmonies than he has been on his last couple albums with the band.    The veteran Red Hots are showing some signs of decline — specifically the 59-year-old Kiedis, who has always had more charisma than technical singing ability, and here relies so heavily on pitch correction that it drains some of the personality from his voice. Stripped-down moments, like the dreary momentum-killer  ""Not the One""  or the pop-funk comedown ""It's Only Natural,"" plainly expose the warbling, robotic processing on Kiedis's vocal tracks.    But largely, the most surprising thing is how quickly the Chili Peppers have fallen back into lockstep. The band's albums with outgoing guitarist  Josh Klinghoffer  weren't bad, exactly —  The Getaway  in particular holds up quite nicely — but, when listening to  Unlimited Love , there's a strong sense of everything falling into place and order being restored.

2022-04-04,Alex Hudson,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Jack White Turns Everything Up to 11 on 'Fear of the Dawn',,"""The easy way out would be to cater to the person who just wants me to record 'Fell in Love With a Girl' or 'Lazaretto' over and over again, and then keep writing 55 songs with heavy riffs in them. That's just boring to me. I just don't have the patience to numb my brain that much.""     Jack White  said that in a  2018 interview with Exclaim!  about his experimental third solo album,  Boarding House Reach . But White has clearly rediscovered his love for heavy riffs, since fourth solo outing  Fear of the Dawn  just might be the most consistently heavy record in his entire career.    White's energy is at a fever pitch for nearly all of  Fear of the Dawn , with lead single  ""Taking Me Back""  setting the tone for this frenzied album. It's not a red herring: title track ""Fear of the Dawn"" soaks its swing time groove in low-end fuzz and sci-fi synth screeches, while the caveman blues licks of ""What's the Trick?"" trace a line all the way back to the White Stripes' pre-fame albums.    This isn't to say that White is repeating himself.  ""Hi-De-Ho""  is a particularly freaky offering, beginning with a dramatic overture of swing legend Cab Calloway's singing before doing a complete 180 with a rap verse from  Q-Tip . It's a bit of a mess, but it's entertaining to hear White take such a big swing. ""Into the Twilight"" blends its guitar crunch with a prominent vocal sample, while the computerized guitars of ""The White Raven"" and ""That Was Then (This Is Now)"" are so effected that it's difficult to tell what's a six-string and what's a synth. The short instrumental ""Dusk"" reemerges in the extended outro of ""Morning, Noon and Night,"" a compelling collision of jammed-out rambunctiousness and studio trickery.    Ironically, it's the quietest song here — the bluesy, slow-burning closer ""Shedding My Velvet"" — that possibly leaves the biggest impression, opting for sexy swagger over brash stomp. This bodes well for White's next album,  Entering Heaven Alive , which follows this summer and is said to be a much mellower listen.    White has explored many of the ideas heard on  Fear of the Dawn  before: the robo riffs of ""Blue Orchid,"" the atmospheric hip-hop rhythms of ""Freedom at 21"" and the bloopy synth squiggles of  Boarding House Reach  are all touchpoints here. But  Fear of the Dawn  pushes these ideas so far that it still feels like a bold step forward.    By splitting his 2022 albums into two distinct projects and saving his quieter material for  Entering Heaven Alive , White has delivered his best release since 2012's  Blunderbuss , and one of the most consistently exciting albums in his 25-year-career.

2022-04-06,Cole Brocksom,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Deanna Petcoff Puts Honesty at the Heart of 'To Hell with You, I Love You'",,"Deanna Petcoff  has gathered a following in Toronto's music scene with a lovestruck, forlorn brand of indie rock. Her first full-length LP,  To Hell with You, I Love You , is an album for hopeless romantics. Each song alone holds its own nuanced emotionality. From self-deprecation stomper ""Trash Bag,"" to the heart-wrenching piano ballad ""Sing with Me,"" Petcoff's lyrics show there's more beneath the surface than what's at first glance. When taken all together,  To Hell with You, I Love You  paints a picture of love, loss, and longing.    On opener ""Failing Upwards,"" the first taste of Petcoff's songwriting arrives with a dreamy shuffle and a hook begging to be sung along with. The refrain, ""I know you're not trying to break my heart, but you're doing a bang-up job / And I told you I'm not trying to lose your trust, but at least I'm failing upwards"" fills a soaring melody, placing the most important and relatable lyrics alongside the catchiest part of the song.    It's a technique Petcoff uses to great effect on tracks like ""Devastatingly Mediocre"" where she asks herself, ""Why do I search all night for a chance to say your name?"" or ""That's What I Get"" with the lament, ""That's what we get for always playing pretend, that's what we get for always saying it's fine / it hurts to know that we can't even be friends, that's what we get."" These hooks convey complex emotional ideas — like wondering why you let yourself fall for someone who doesn't meet your standards, or knowing you need to move on from a relationship even if you don't want to — in short, memorable fashion. Petcoff expands from there in the verses with clean, beachy guitars and windswept atmospheres.    These aesthetics aren't groundbreaking, but Petcoff still finds room to explore in the styles that she's curated on this project. More upbeat tunes like ""I Don't Wanna Get Over You"" and ""Failing Upwards"" have an ethereal, yet driving feel, tiptoeing just outside of garage rock with riffs that harken back to the late-2000s/early-2010s indie rock heyday.    Meanwhile, the slow-burning deep cuts offer some variety. ""As Much As I Can"" features plucked acoustic rhythm guitar and echoey rimshots that give the tune a bossa nova feel. ""I Didn't Lie"" starts small with some very bedroom pop digital percussion, but quickly builds to a grandiose swell of strings and voices. Album closer ""Sing with Me"" is only piano and Petcoff's whisper-quiet vocals, exactly all it needs to let the impact of her songwriting show.    There's an honesty to the music of  To Hell with You, I Love You . Though some tracks are more memorable than others, they all serve to put Petcoff's voice and words in the spotlight where they belong. Her songs are confessional and intimate, every word and note carrying emotion; she can make you want to bawl your eyes out in one breath, and then dance the tears away in the next.  To Hell with You, I Love You  shares a piece of Petcoff's heart that's asking you to sing along.

2022-04-06,Alan Ranta,8,"PUNK,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The Linda Lindas Tap Into Youthful Punk Potential on 'Growing Up',,"The Linda Lindas  make no attempt to hide their youth. They named their debut album  Growing Up , and its title track is a spirited pop-punk anthem celebrating the vigour and camaraderie of children who happen to grow up together, making mistakes and building character. If that song was the only thing to go by, one might think the Linda Lindas are some kind of  Hannah Montana  reboot, but they did not make a Disney album. The Linda Lindas are mad as hell, and they'll tell you why in no uncertain terms.    The precocious Los Angeles-based punk band is comprised of sisters Mila and Lucia de la Garza, an 11-year-old drummer and 14-year-old guitarist, along with their 13-year-old cousin/bassist Eloise Wong and 17-year-old friend/guitarist Bela Salazar. They all sing and switch around instruments too. Don't judge this book by its cover. The Linda Lindas may not actually have anyone named Linda, but this band is not messing around. Underestimate them at your own peril.    Long before  Growing Up , the Linda Lindas had been paying their dues. After forming for a one-off set at the L.A.-area Girlschool music festival in 2018, they continued on as a band to open for the likes of Phranc, the Dils and Alley Cats, and eventually performed with Best Coast, Alice Bag and Bleached. An opportunity to write a song for Netflix documentary  The Claudia Kishi Club  inspired them to start writing their own original music, and soon after, they appeared in and recorded songs for the soundtrack of Amy Poehler's coming-of-age feminist film  Moxie .    Sadly, there is no age restriction for experiencing racism and sexism, and being half-Asian and half-Latinx, these young women have lived with that ugly reality all of their lives. Before the pandemic, a schoolmate of Mila's made a comment amplifying something racist his father had told him. Exacting Tito Puente's revenge, the band wrote a song about it called  ""Racist, Sexist Boy.""     Their timing was perfect. The Linda Lindas went viral in May 2021 with a video rendition of ""Racist, Sexist Boy"" recorded live at the Los Angeles Public Library. As the video spread, prominent rockers such as Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine), Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth) sang its praises, while legendary punk label Epitaph  immediately signed the band .    One must be wary of packaged rebellion, of course. Avril Lavigne was initially marketed as ""the anti-Britney"" based on appearance, but if you compare their music, there isn't much difference beyond genre — an unsurprising observation considering they both employed the same songwriting teams, like the Matrix. With that in mind, there are elements of  Growing Up  that sound a little too good to be true. This album was definitely not recorded at the library. There are moments polished to an unreal shine, but it makes sense when you look at the credits.      Growing Up  was produced, mixed and engineered primarily by Carlos de la Garza at his own Music Friends studio in Los Angeles. In addition to drumming in bands like F.Y.P. and Reel Big Fish, Carlos mixed Ziggy Marley's Grammy-winning self-titled album and engineered Tegan and Sara's multiple-Juno-winning 2013 effort  Hearthrob , as well as Wolf Alice's Mercury Prize-winning 2018 album  Visions of a Life . He has produced everyone from Paramore, Cherry Glazerr, Best Coast and Bleached, to Epitaph bands such as Bad Religion, HUNNY and Teenage Wrist. He is kind of a big deal. He is also the father of Mila and Lucia, and produced the Linda Lindas' eponymous debut EP from 2020, so they had an easier path to get where they are than someone randomly mailing demos to Epitaph.     That said, spend time with the Linda Lindas, and it's obvious they weren't simply handed everything. They seized their opportunities. All one has to do is watch them absolutely crush it on  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  to see what is coming. They have the swagger and style, and they don't care if anyone doesn't like it.      The opening track on  Growing Up ,  ""Oh!""  hits the ground running with its throwback punk chant and enthusiastically minimal melodies, sounding like Joan Jett covering the Ramones. Its lyrics exude the sense of frustration and futility, speaking out against societal wrongs that we feel powerless to change, as well as the guilt if we say nothing. This sentiment is more broadly reflected in ""Talking to Myself,"" which beckons commiseration in talking about things that we can't help, and in ""Growing Up,"" where the kids talk about things that aren't fair. Talking about things can be therapeutic, as is listening to this album.     Other moments are a little breezier. The surfy harmonizing power-pop pluck of  ""Nino""  lands somewhere between La Luz and Blondie, while lyrically paying tribute to a fantastic feline reminiscent of the cat jam ""Monica"" from their self-titled EP. They even throw in a little bossa nova flavour on ""Cuantas Veces"" (""How Often"" in Spanish), further demonstrating the influences and experience beyond their years.    A studio recording of ""Racist, Sexist Boy"" closes  Growing Up . It is as fierce an example of political hardcore as you'll find this side of Bikini Kill, whom they supported at one of their first-ever gigs at the Hollywood Palladium in 2019. It heralds the second coming of riot grrl with a side of kawaii cuddle-core, channeling the fiery rock power of the Runaways, the new wave gloss of the Go-Go's, and the pop-punk exuberance of Blink-182.    With every moment of unflinching social commentary, the Linda Lindas let listeners in to the smouldering embers of youthful promise we all have before the weight of the world eventually crushes our spirit. For as wide as their appeal could be, their eyes are open wider. The Linda Lindas do not pull any punches. Judge this book by its cover, and it will judge you right back. The library is open.

2022-04-07,Alan Ranta,8,"SOUL & FUNK,R&B,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Tanika Charles's Voice Is the Leading Light of 'Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly',,"Tanika Charles  was in the process of taking her career to the next level when the pandemic cancelled everything. She tasted success with her 2016 debut  Soul Run  and 2019 follow-up  The Gumption ; both were nominated for Juno awards and long-listed by the Polaris Music Prize. Charles had planned a significant tour to give  The Gumption  a well-deserved victory lap and solidify her status as one of Canada's all-time greatest soul divas when suddenly there was nothing.     Charles has now emerged with her third studio album,  Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly . Crafting songs with regular collaborators like Robert Bolton, who helped write her first two albums, she forged new connections amidst the otherwise isolating lockdowns, exploring new contexts for her powerful yet elegant voice.    The album's theme is expressed in the poetry of its rather Canadian bilingual title. A butterfly of the night, particularly when articulated in the silkiness of its original French, is a beautiful way of referring to a moth. Generally overlooked insects, moths tend to unassumingly blend into the background until they bump into your porch light. Yet, if people knew them as night butterflies instead, perhaps they'd get a smidge more shine.     To be clear,  Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly  is not a concept album about moths. Most of its lyrics speak to the blossoming, failing and endurance of love. The concept of not taking things (or people) for granted is clearly expressed in the dreamy slow jam ""Don't Be So Entitled."" Charles warns, ""you don't own what you can't see"" in one of those perfectly composed can't-believe-it's-not Motown moments, with backing singers echoing the falling melody of her plaintive vocals. If the right person hears this song at the right time, it could save relationships.      Although the lyrics of ""Hold Me (Like a Grudge)"" speak of being confined in a relationship, Charles sounds freer in the rawer setting. Her commanding voice punches through the funky instrumental, a gently simmering boom-bap beat accented by jazzy guitar and comforting cooing. ""Million Ways"" is so clean that it ends up sliding by fairly easily, yet it feels like the whole world stops when Charles demands ""hold on"" in the gripping hook of ""Hold Me (Like a Grudge).""     A few tracks on  Papillon de Nuit  hit that blessed throwback note. ""Rent Free"" could easily be a Daptone Records single, with Charles sounding as epic as Sharon Jones as she sings of a bad ex-partner who still lives rent-free in her memories. Closing the album on a nearly opposite note, ""Honey Baby"" is an old school duet with Khari McClelland lifted up by jaunty, off-key piano, crisp drums and psychedelic soul guitar, culminating with a string of delightful food innuendo pillow talk.     Charles has found new strength in her perceptive ability to find the right settings for her voice, and that hits home on the title track. On ""Papillon de Nuit,"" she sings that she isn't lost, she's breaking ground, and that sure is what it looks like from over here. There's no denying her metamorphosis into something greater on ""Different Morning."" Her dreamy vocals and the life-affirming verse from  DijahSB  perfectly meld with the addictive afterparty essence of the instrumental. They rock a grooving beat with funky bass guitar, dreamy horns and woozy electric piano, with a touch of organic percussion brilliantly balancing the 808 plinks.    Regardless of how many nominations it receives or how the industry votes,  Papillon de Nuit: The Night Butterfly  is already a winner.

2022-03-11,Manus Hopkins,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Ghost Give Up Satan for Arena-Sized Ambition on 'Impera',,"As  Ghost 's popularity rose over the past decade, it was obvious there would come a day when the Swedish occult-metal outfit would move away from their over-the-top Satanic themes into more accessible, chart-friendly territory. 2018's  Prequelle  saw the band, led by mastermind Tobias Forge, play it safer than ever. While Ghost showed that they were able to produce songs that could comfortably be played in arena settings, they also lost some of their bite in doing so. The good news for longtime Ghost fans is that with  Impera , Forge has created a more thematically interesting and more musically complex album than its predecessor. The bad news is that  Impera  is still more of a continuation of the trajectory the band has been on its past few years than a return to their devil-worshiping earlier days.     Let's start with the good things. ""Call Me Little Sunshine"" and ""Twenties"" are some of the strongest songs in Ghost's catalog thus far, the former featuring one of the catchiest riffs in the band's career, and the latter making incredible use of unorthodox rhythmic work — something we actually hear quite a bit throughout  Impera . Closer ""Respite on the Spitalfields"" is a near-perfect song, taking Ghost's signature sound and ramping up the '70s and '80s elements to create an epic, heroic culmination, stopping just short of ending up in self-indulgent prog rock territory.    The album's theme, centring on the fall of empire, serves the music well, playing into a grandiosity and epic feel for which Ghost's old sinister sound has now been completely swapped out, for better or worse. Ghost have always made catchy songs with pop elements, and most of  Impera 's tracks are no exception, but holding the album up next to the band's earlier efforts — which sound like hymns for an evil church service — only a shadow of the upside-down gospel music that first put Ghost on the map remains. These songs sound as if they were written specifically to be played in arenas by a world-class rock band, not at strange, cult-like gatherings.      Impera  isn't without its missteps, however. Thankfully, it doesn't include overly long instrumental tracks like  Prequelle  did, but it does have some unnecessary interludes that could have just been parts of the tracks into which they lead. The power metal-esque guitar work and chorus of ""Kaisarion"" come off sounding cartoonish, even for Ghost. ""Hunter's Moon"" is a fine cut, but it doesn't have a memorable chorus or lead riff to really make it a standout.      Impera  is a solid album and an obvious next step in Ghost's career. It's bittersweet to see the campy Satanic days firmly behind the band, but any old-school fan should still be proud to see what the band has achieved, and it's clear that  Impera  is the album Ghost needed to take their career to the next level. They've stuck to their guns enough that they may not change the minds of many of their scathing critics, but with a new, less evil image and feel, they should be able to attract a more mainstream audience and continue their trajectory into becoming a flagship band for 21st century rock. Still, it's sad to see the old Ghost go.

2022-03-15,Luke Fox,8,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Benny the Butcher's 'Tana Talk 4' Is a Quality Capstone to His Mixtape Series,,"Benny the Butcher , who recently inked a deal with  Def Jam , could be on the brink of going mainstream. But he's always been major. If a big label budget and the trappings that come with it — R&B hooks, radio-ready singles, more crossover cameos — are around the corner, the Butcher's final indie hurrah is a wonderful parting gift to his diehard fans.    There is nothing out of pocket about  Tana Talk 4 , sticky with tales and testaments from Benny's drug-dealing past. Also, there is not one song worth skipping. Twelve tightly packaged joints, 40 minutes of crunchy beats produced exclusively by  the Alchemist  and long-serving Griselda beatmaker Daringer, and bars upon bars. If you're looking for something experimental, glance elsewhere. If you're satisfied with straight-up good rap music, the search is over.    In a statement, Benny said he had ""a chip on his shoulder"" creating this project, which revives a mixtape series he began in 2004. It was 2018's  Tana Talk 3  that jolted the Buffalo bard's trajectory, stirring up enough buzz for him to branch outside his posse and record with  Harry Fraud  and  Hit-Boy , and reap collaborations with the likes of  Black Thought ,  Jadakiss ,  2 Chainz  and  Pusha-T . ""On a shoestring budget, I showed them what I could do,"" Benny reminds on this go-round.     Tana Talk 4 's level of quality starts sky high with ""Johnny P's Caddy,"" a reference to the Cadillac that Benny's father drove him and  Westside Gunn  around in as kids, fostering his son's love of music through the car speakers. Alchemist whips up a soul platter for Benny and  J. Cole  to puff their chests and put their pens to the test.    Smart, forceful writing continues throughout as Benny's deliberate delivery slices through the horns of ""Throwy's Revenge"" and the frenetic synths of ""Guerrero."" Usual suspects  Boldy James ,  Conway the Machine , 38 Spesh and Westside Gunn drop by, adding welcome vocal texture to Benny's predictably clear and metronome-like cadence. ""Back 2x,"" featuring the underrated Stove God Cooks, hits you in the chest with a double barrel of punchlines and arrogance. It's precisely the type of song born out of a harsh winter in Upstate New York.    The greatest curveball is  Diddy  showing up to lend ad-libs to the well-executed concept track ""10 More Commandments,"" a sequel to  the Notorious B.I.G. 's 1997 favourite ""Ten Crack Commandments."" Daringer whips up some trippy snares and a nervous keyboard line for Benny to school aspiring street pharmacists. Lesson 17: ""Take care of the people around you / They only appreciate how you value loyalty when they eatin' beside you.""    If you weren't a fan of Benny prior,  Tana Talk 4  likely won't win you over. But if you were, the latest fuel for  Griselda 's hot streak will keep your Caddy bumping until the next blast outta Buffalo.

2022-03-17,Bruno Coulombe,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Lisa LeBlanc's 'Chiac Disco' Is a Dance of Humour and Homage,,"Along with pioneers Radio Radio and up-and-coming acts like Les Hay Babies and P'tit Belliveau,  Lisa LeBlanc  has been at the forefront of the  Acadian music boom  of the 2010s. Building on her trademark wit and humour, LeBlanc's new album  Chiac Disco  harks back to the dancing days of the 1970s, combining funky rhythms with her Acadian dialect to produce something colourful and exuberant.     LeBlanc has always had a knack for telling stories with ironic humour in a way that feels like she's poking fun at herself, while also exposing our own quirks. In the past, she would treat her songs with more down-to-earth arrangements, using the banjo as a reminder of her folk roots. This time, everything feels bigger, with shiny orchestration and dance pop rhythms that instantly recall acts like the Emotions or  Boney M .     In a sense,  Chiac Disco  continues on the same path as LeBlanc's 2020 EP as Belinda,  It's Not a Game, It's a Lifestyle , which drew on a wide range of influences from new wave to electronic dance music. Here, the result is more cohesive, as the whole album sounds like a nod to another era.    Opener ""Pourquoi faire aujourd'hui"" sets the tone in brilliant fashion, with kitschy strings and spacey keyboards that recall the sparkling allure of  Chic . Standout track ""Veux-tu rentrer dans ma bubble?"" is more funk-driven, powered by an irresistible groove and punching horn riffs à la  James Brown . With its overt references to 1970s music,  Chiac Disco  lies somewhere between pastiche and homage. Although LeBlanc and co-producer Benoît Morier approach their topic with a certain sense of derision, it's also clear that they love their material.    They don't just borrow from funk and disco. The intro of ""Dans l'jus"" recalls the soundtracks of  Ennio Morricone , while the chord sequence of the quieter ""Me semble que c'est facile"" unmistakably evokes  Led Zeppelin 's ""Stairway to Heaven."" The only downside is that the tone feels a bit less personal at times, as if LeBlanc was portraying a character.     Lyrically,  Chiac Disco  largely opts for humour and lightness, as LeBlanc offers clever observations on modern life: the joys of procrastination, gossiping at Tim Hortons, Acadian cuisine (""pas d'épices, juste du sel,"" she sings on ""Le menu acadien"") or when leaving the couch feels like an impossible quest. The truth is that these texts would have worked just fine with the  folk-trash  that used to characterize LeBlanc's style, but imbuing them with sparkling instrumentation gives them a totally different feel.      Chiac Disco  works best when its joy is paired with a certain feeling of grandeur, as on ""Entre toi pi moi pi la corde de bois"" which echoes the sweeping arrangements of  Lee Hazlewood . But because it's more polished, the album doesn't quite match the intensity and grit of the Polaris Music Prize-shortlisted  Why You Wanna Leave, Runaway Queen? . Still, its total sense of freedom and abandon make for a very rewarding listen.

Despite the modest tone — there's not a whiff of pretension to be found — Dawson's album is a triumph. Fans of the guitarist and producer will not be disappointed, and newcomers will be floored by the sheer talent on display.      Gone, Long Gone  is the Juno-winning musician's first collection of songs since his 2016 album  Solid States and Loose Ends , and the album is more than worth the wait. Dawson wrote (or co-wrote) nine of its 10 songs, in addition to producing, recording and mixing. Featuring a roster of talented musicians, including Grammy nominee  Allison Russell , his latest release is a masterclass in independent music production.      Gone, Long Gone  is coherent and consistent without feeling repetitive or tedious. There's a common personality connecting the tracks, which are all unique and interesting. It can be difficult to balance versatility in a collection of songs without sacrificing cohesion, but Dawson pulls it off flawlessly. His passion centres an album that defies genre convention — with ""roots"" or ""folk"" feeling the most apt, although ""blues"" or even ""singer-songwriter"" feel equally appropriate.    Effortlessly sliding from joyful to mournful and back again,  Gone, Long Gone  is a fully realized album that exudes creative energy. The opening song ""Dimes"" is a funky blues piece with a great hook and punchy horns. The penultimate track, ""Cicada Sanctuary"" is a stripped-down instrumental that's just Dawson playing guitar — and it's fantastic.    ""Kulaniapia Waltz"" is surprising instrumental that leans into the Hawaiian string sound to great effect. Both ""King Bennie Had His Shit Together"" and ""Bad Omen"" are fun and full of personality. ""Gone, Long Gone"" is a wistful acoustic song, featuring just the right amount of strings and pedal steel. The ending track, ""Time Has Made a Fool of Me,"" is the softest and most contemplative of the batch. It's a bittersweet note to end on, but not unpleasantly so.    That these very different-sounding songs are equally compelling speaks to just how phenomenal Dawson's artistry is on  Gone Long Gone .

2022-03-17,Kaelen Bell,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Charli XCX Makes a Messy, Exciting 'CRASH' into Her Own Legacy",,"It's here! Five months, some  mild Twitter beef  and a surprisingly late-in-the-game (for a  Charli XCX  album, anyway) leak later,  CRASH  has finally careened out of the garage. The rollout for Charli's fifth and last full-length record for Atlantic has been bumpy, defined by a surprising — and vaguely worrisome — level of hostility between fan and artist. So, was all the hubbub worth it? Now that it's arrived, where does  CRASH  leave us?     Those who were disappointed by the record's sleek handful of singles can breathe a sigh of relief:  CRASH  is largely stronger than the sum of its disparate parts. However, those who were hoping for some kind of definitive Charli album will have to hold their breath a little longer.    Those semi-controversial singles account for some of the record's weakest moments —  ""Good Ones""  remains too faceless, while the frenetic, bubbly production on ""Baby"" can't make up for its grating chorus — though they're strengthened in the context of their more dynamic counterparts. ""Move Me"" is all icy clatter and crystalline atmosphere, with beautiful, aching verses offset by an ecstatic (if familiar) chorus. The spring-loaded synth figure that spirals beneath ""Constant Repeat"" is another highlight, with its warbled, circling outro feeling earned despite the song's relative brevity.     The new jack swing of the title track introduces  CRASH  with a blast of irrepressible energy, opening the record on a manifesto à la  Charli 's ""Next Level Charli."" It's the most obvious example of Janet Jackson's apparent influence. But, like a handful of songs on  CRASH , it feels a touch constricted. The chorus might've hit once, twice more, while the tightly-coiled guitar solo could've — and should've — been allowed to snake beyond the song's confines.      The second half of the record stumbles more than the first. The stomp-clap groove of ""Yuck"" feels too much like a Dua Lipa B-side, while ""Every Rule"" is too toothless — featuring a traditional Charli topline melody, an issue that pops up a handful of times across the album — to make much of an impression at all. Taken as a whole however, the album manages to even out in terms of quality, a consistent energetic clip and some intuitive sequencing helping prop the weaker songs against the sturdy scaffolding of tracks like ""New Shapes"" and ""Move Me."" The record hits its nadir at ""Used to Know Me,"" featuring another prominent interpolation (this time of Robin S.'s ""Show Me Love"") that, much like ""Beg for You,"" feels like the lukewarm result of a stan focus group.     CRASH  takes flight the further Charli strays from the quasi-ironic ""main pop girl"" narrative cage that she's trapped herself in, when she allows her destabilizing energy to rattle the bars. ""Lightning"" is both the record's strangest and longest song, clocking in at a whopping three minutes and 47 seconds of frenzied percussion, sparkling Spanish guitar and vocoder-gargled vocals. It's also probably the album's best song, a taste of the weirdness that Charli is so adept at maneuvering within.    ""Lightning"" is also the only track on  CRASH  that feels sufficiently informed by the record's blood-streaked, Cronenbergian visual world. It's a bracing screech of burnt rubber and impacted metal amongst all the spotless chrome and polished glass; it's hard not to wish that Charli and her co-conspirators had leaned a bit further into this chaos.    There's been plenty of (premature) talk — on Twitter anyway, where 99.9 percent of Charli XCX opinion-havers seem to be — surrounding  CRASH 's perceived lack of quality and/or cohesion, the record's rollout leaving some fans wary. It's not necessarily hard to see why. Charli herself seems unsure of what  CRASH  is actually meant to be, oscillating between her particular brand of stan-approved self-aggrandizement and a vulnerable defensiveness that's come to define the record's narrative. Is it a go-for-broke attempt at genuine crossover radio play? If so, it fails by any obvious chart metrics. Is it an ironic commentary on pop stardom and industry machinations? If so, it falls short again. The unrefined narrative conceit that's been built around the album muddies a pretty strong set of songs, gently recalling the conceptual framework of St. Vincent's  Daddy's Home  — the sensation that you're listening to an album that, by its own creator's tacit admission, is perhaps unfit to speak for itself.    It's when you slough away all that baggage that you get to the viper-red heart of  CRASH ; it's a blindingly bright, gleefully energetic collection of pop songs from an artistic who's good at making exactly that. It's not Charli's strongest full-length statement — that honour still belongs to  Pop 2  or  how i'm feeling now , albums that encapsulate Charli's particular flavour of mangled, caustic beauty — but it's the kind of brash, whiplash-inducing pop album that only she seems capable of making at the moment. It's a bit messy, but most crashes are.

2022-03-21,Alex Hudson,5,"EP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Weezer's 'SZNZ: Spring' Is as Annoying as Renaissance Faire Cosplay,,"There's something entertaining, even admirable, about the way  Weezer  leader Rivers Cuomo continues to follow his weirdest whims. The results are sometimes excellent (2021's orchestral  OK Human ), occasionally dreadful (the plastic pop of 2019's  Black Album ) and often somewhere in between (the faux hard rock of 2021's  Van Weezer ) — but no matter where Weezer land these days, listeners can usually count on them to take a big swing.    Their latest off-the-wall concept is  SZNZ , a series of four EPs arriving on 2022's equinoxes and solstices, loosely inspired by Vivaldi's  The Four Seasons . Why? Who knows! Why not, I guess.    Weezer have always sounded like an extremely summery band.  Spring , on the other hand, is a slightly harder vibe to pin down, and Weezer give the season a pastoral, fantastical, pseudo-pagan interpretation. The band's medieval-style press photo looks like they wandered off the set of  Lord of the Rings ; Cuomo is wearing elf ears. He  told NPR  that he wrote the album while imagining himself in Shakespeare's  A Midsummer Night's Dream , except that play is quite literally about ""midsummer,"" so even Cuomo seems to be struggling to pin down the feeling of spring.    The results careen awkwardly between the trad-folk of a Renaissance faire and Weezer's usual crunchy guitars. ""Opening Night"" is particularly bizarre, with mandolins, recorders and lyrics like ""Shakespeare makes me happy / So happy."" The song then abruptly pivots with chugging, distorted guitars that are classic Weezer. Has there every been a song with such an utterly abysmal verse and such a good chorus?    This wild unevenness is typical for  Spring . The Renaissance cosplay schtick is grating, as if Weezer learned everything they know about folk music from  Monty Python and the Holy Grail , but they sound fantastic when they're just being themselves. Jake Sinclair, who produced the band's post-millennium high water marks  White Album  and  OK Human , is back as co-producer, and maybe it's thanks to him that ""Angels on Vacation"" could almost pass as vintage Weezer (or at least 2014–2016 Weezer). ""The Garden of Eden"" has clunky lyrics about Velcro shoes and Adam and Eve, but the grungy doo-wop tune is lovely, and Cuomo cleverly throws a little hip-hop cadence into his vocals.    Lead single ""A Little Bit of Love"" lands somewhere in the middle of  Spring 's two styles, its merry mandolins and stomping beat channeling the cheerful sound of a post-Mumford car commercial. There's even a very on-the-nose ""hey-ho"" bridge, just in case it didn't already sound enough like the Lumineers.     Spring 's relentless optimism takes Weezer out of their sweet spot, since they've always excelled at injecting upbeat pop with bittersweet melancholy. Then again, the themes of rebirth and renewal feel appropriate for this moment in history; a couple of of the songs explicitly allude to COVID-era reopening, as ""The Sound of Drums"" includes a chorus of ""It's good to see my old friends / Man, it's been so long,"" while ""All This Love"" finds Cuomo declaring, ""I forgot how to live, how to love, how to give / How to sing with a mask on my mouth."" These lines capture the idea of spring far better than silly mandolins or harpsichords.     Spring  certainly isn't the worst Weezer album (don't worry,  Pacific Daydream , that title still belongs to you!), but it's frustrating to hear them sabotaging their own songs in a futile attempt to pin down the sound of a season. So far,  SZNZ  feels less like a lofty concept and more like silly gimmick.

2022-03-22,Adam Feibel,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Camp Cope Eye Personal and Artistic Growth on 'Running with the Hurricane',,"The main takeaway from  Camp Cope 's widely praised sophomore album was the Melbourne trio's biting commentary on the role of women in the music industry. In particular, ""The Opener,"" the punnily titled first song on 2018's  How to Socialise & Make Friends ,  leapt out of the speakers and made clear the band's intentions to push back against an environment that viewed groups like theirs as rarely more than a supporting act. It was a record that seethed with anger over the many faces of misogyny in music, but also displayed an emotional range that gave it depth and complexity. Musically, the band built upon their scrappy indie rock sound — snarkily punky and charmingly folksy in almost equal measure — and rose to greater heights after their eponymous debut had made them a success in Australia.    Now, having said what they needed to say, Camp Cope feel refreshed, rejuvenated and newly contented on their third album  Running with the Hurricane .  It's not that singer-songwriter Georgia Maq's anger about systemic equality has evaporated, nor have her wounds suffered from love, heartbreak and failure entirely healed. But musically and lyrically, these songs feel like an enormous weight has been lifted off the group's shoulders.    While  How to Socialise  dealt with feelings of anger and pain,  Hurricane  is focused on what's on the other side of adversity. With that comes more tender songwriting and brighter, gentler arrangements. Here, Camp Cope are a lot less Bikini Kill and a lot more Hop Along. They often evoke the soft-rock stylings of Canadian icons like Sarah McLachlan, Jann Arden and the sentimental side of Avril Lavigne, and there are Joni Mitchellisms to more than a few of Maq's melodies. Yet with organic production by Anna Laverty, and defiantly animated rhythm work by bassist Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich and drummer Sarah Thompson, their music still has that distinctly DIY spirit of underground indie-rockers.    On the title track, Maq sings about overcoming chaos and darkness to come out stronger on the other side — ""There's no other way to go / The only way out is up"" — and it bursts with the sunny energy of a Sheryl Crow tune. Throughout  Hurricane,  Maq is constantly singing about opening herself up to life. In power ballads ""One Wink at a Time"" and ""The Screaming Planet,"" she opens herself up to affection, but also to solitude. In the radiant choruses of ""Jealous,"" she opens herself up to vulnerability with a new person. And in the spunky yet subdued ""Blue"" and ""The Mountain,"" she sings of loving with all her heart, in spite of everything. It ends with the stunning ""Sing Your Heart Out,"" closing the record with a push toward self-acceptance: ""You are not your past, not your mistakes, not your money, not your pain / Not the years you spent inside / you can change and so can I.""    Early on, Camp Cope showed that they can strike out with enough force to make a dent in the music industry.  Running with the Hurricane  shows that they can love with just as much intensity. The songs are filled with empathy, compassion and encouragement, and there's a new tenderness in Maq's voice that makes the music all the more likely to touch your heart. It's an album that's expressly designed to comfort the afflicted, rather than afflict the comfortable.    They may have over-softened, though. There are a lot of simply beautiful songs here, but not unlike previous Camp Cope efforts,  Running with the Hurricane  is held back by sameness. If the band had added some more dynamics to their sound, allowing themselves to indulge in the wild and unruly side we had previously heard, the arrival at peace and harmony would be all the more satisfying. There's no calm quite as relieving as the one just after a storm has passed. This is a band that's clearly intent on making beauty out of chaos — if we could hear that happening in real time, there's no doubt it would be explosively cathartic. Still, it's rewarding to see Camp Cope find the kind of personal and artistic growth that so many long for.  Running with the Hurricane  finds them more in control than ever ( Run For Cover )                           POP AND ROCK   ALBUM   REVIEWS   MUSIC              More Camp Cope",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/camp_cope_running_with_the_hurricane_album_review
2022-03-22,Safiya Hopfe,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Aldous Harding Finds Freedom in Stylistic Collage on 'Warm Chris',,"New Zealand's  Aldous Harding  is a master of negative space. Her prowess is quiet: she weaves intimate walls in hushed proclamations, pauses, and sighs. Brief silences and muted splatters of percussion amplify the rich emotional crescendos of her songs, which often read like surrealistic diary entries, and at other times like letters written in dreams. She mixes metaphors, paints composite memories, and takes her inner child to shows. Her elegant bridging of the metaphysical and the mundane teems with images which seep into one another and grow, wobbling, like droplets of water. Her work is faithful to subtlety and prudence. Even in interviews she is soft-spoken but deliberate, appearing to measure each word: carefully, unblinking.    Her fourth album  Warm Chris  — the follow up to 2019's critically acclaimed  Designer  — is an exception. Here, Harding's power lies in where she frees herself rather than where she restrains herself. Whimsical, bizarre and somehow still rich with grace,  Warm Chris  is a stylistic collage that twists and turns defiantly at each moment categorization begins to feel plausible.    Harding has spent enough time meditating in raw, uncanny tongues about surrender, pleasure, and performance that it is only natural that she has found space, at long last, to play. Her second album  Party  — of which the title track was a lullaby that seemed at once to mourn past, present, and future — practically oozed melancholy, emulating the soulful folk of Karen Dalton and the stalking ambience of Portishead in accounts of loss and respite.  Designer  magnified solace in strange places, merging more expansive textures of brass and synthesizers with acoustic guitar.    Harding's bittersweet ruminations have often boasted a peculiar warmth, but  Warm Chris  — produced, as  Party  and  Designer  were, with John Parish — truly evokes celebration. ""Cut it up / Put it in my hand / You've become my joy, you understand,"" Harding sings after the opening chords of ""Ennui,"" which march gleefully toward anticipatory hums. ""Got a little colour in the back / I love it.""    It is not simply the thematic swapping of sorrow and solace for relief and hope that sets  Warm Chris  apart from Harding's last three records. Her songs still exist in an emotional world weighted by anxiety, absence, and the tension between desire and existential truth. In this world, though, these songs dance rather than pace — the inner child she crooned about on  Designer  mutters, smacks her lips, and stomps her feet.    In the span of only 10 tracks, Harding tries on a plethora of personas, proving the instrument of her voice to be a superpower of versatility. On the chorus of ""Tick Tock,"" she teases and taunts, ""Wanted to see me / Whatcha gonna do? / Now that you see me / Tick tock!"" On ""Fever,"" she speak-sings about disappointment and reunion with the soulful rasp of Lucinda Williams in a rolling sea of tin and brass. Even as she sings ""I still stare at you in the dark / Looking for the thrill in the nothing,"" she sounds almost victorious.    On the stripped-down title track, Harding's voice takes on a flighty tremble reminiscent of Big Thief's Adrianne Lenker, while on ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain"" she adopts a Waxahatchee-esque twang as a banjo plucks shyly along with a piano in the background. ""Passion Babe"" sees her slide between a mumbling drawl and childlike exclamation in acrobatic leaps so subtle they almost sound effortless. On ""Staring at the Henry Moore,"" Harding inserts the quack of a duck between verses that could have been sung by Vashti Bunyan. Her sure-footed vocal shifts vary so dramatically on the record that it is difficult, at times, to believe that she alone is singing.    The throughline is unmistakable, though, in her elastic voice and whimsy-fuelled instincts — she is free and she knows it. Without sacrificing the elegance for which she has been revered, Harding tries new palettes, painting impressions of small worlds in whatever textures emerge and trusting them as they do.  Warm Chris  is neither refined nor contained: it wanders and wonders, affirming the sheer joy of curiosity.

2022-03-23,Sarah Bea Milner,7,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Cowboy Junkies Make Folk Classics Their Own on 'Songs of the Recollection',,"Cowboy Junkies  have always known how to make a good cover. The long-running Toronto alt-country group broke out into the mainstream in 1988 with  The Trinity Session , which went double-platinum in Canada and platinum in the US thanks mainly to the Velvet Underground cover ""Sweet Jane.""      Songs of the Recollection , their latest, marks a bit of return to form for the group, seeing them reinventing folk and country tracks from songwriter powerhouses like Gordon Lightfoot, Neil Young and Gram Parsons. Here, they put their stamp on iconic songs, transforming the music to match their signature style.    It's a fresh and exciting album that channels the obvious passion these musicians share for the artists being covered. Margo Timmins (vocals), Michael Timmins (guitar), Peter Timmins (drums) and Alan Anton (bass) have been playing together for almost four decades, and it shows in the vibrancy of their playing. From start to finish,  Songs of the Recollection  reverberates with the tight-knit energy only found in groups who've played together for a long time.     Songs of the Recollection  is, fittingly, a real throwback, reflecting different alt-country stylings from the past 30 years. ""No Expectations"" features a stripped-down arrangement that calls back to the mid- and late-'90s female-led country pop and rock, while the opening ballad ""Five Years"" gets a powerfully emotional treatment worthy of David Bowie's original version. ""Ooh Las Vegas"" features haunting layered contralto vocals that are a bit reminiscent of mid-aughts Neko Case. Nothing in  Songs of the Recollection  feels particularly innovative, but the musicianship impresses nonetheless.    The clear standout here is ""The Way I Feel,"" first released on a Lightfoot tribute album in 2003. Michael Timmins delivers a guitar solo with just the right amount of grunge, elevating the song by highlighting the darker side of Lightfoot's sound. It's a respectful tribute that really honours the original, but expands the material enough to stand on its own.     ""Marathon,"" a digital bonus track from Cowboy Junkies' 2011 Vic Chestnutt covers album  Demons , is another noteworthy track on the album. It's a slow, moody 6/8 waltz that transforms the original. The Cowboy Junkies version is a droning funeral march with gentle percussion and subtle wails throughout — a distinctly Western take that updates the song for the 21st century while still echoing the past.     For better or for worse,  Songs of the Recollection  gives off the impression of going out to see a cover band at the top of their game. It's a bittersweet reminder of the days when live music was more accessible. No doubt existing fans will love this about the album, but newcomers might be turned off by the uniform approach throughout. Still,  Songs of the Recollection  is a joy to listen to, start to finish.

2022-03-24,Daniel Sylvester,8,"ALBUM,SOUL & FUNK,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC,REVIEWS",Ibibio Sound Machine Fuse Influences to Prove Peerlessness on 'Electricity',,"Within the first moments of ""Protection from Evil,""  Hot Chip 's Al Doyle delivers a rubbery synthline so badass that it establishes  Ibibio Sound Machine 's fourth full-length as a bent-circuit exploration though funk, disco and whatever else they want to throw into the mix.    But don't get it wrong, the octet aren't out to cop Hot Chip's oeuvre — it's in fact the opposite, as Doyle and his bandmates are partially indebted to Ibibio Sound Machine for their late-career adventurousness. Fans of each other's music for nearly a decade,  Electricity  signals the first collaboration between the two electro collectives.    Although it's produced by Hot Chip and vastly influenced by Afrobeat, Tropicália and British acid house, this communicative LP comes off as remarkably inimitable. This may be due to the ubiquitous African, South American and European makeup of the force that is Ibibio Sound Machine.    On the clubby ""17 18 19,"" vocalist Eno Williams stretches her customarily controlled voice to fit the song's dazzling disco aspirations, repeating this same trick for the clattering downbeat of ""Almost Flying"" to create an otherworldly mix. However, for as many tools as Williams utilizes on songs like the rhythm-bending ""Truth No Lie"" or the youthful chants of ""Something We'll Remember,"" her band is able to match her boundless energy flawlessly.    Aside from members of Hot Chip, Ibibio Sound Machine are joined in the studio by a half-dozen musicians who allow songs like the Afrofuturistic stomp of the title track and the joyous Fela Kuti sound collage ""Oyoyo"" to wander off in busy and exploratory sonic interludes that are just as charming and vivid as the bandleader.    On tracks like the slinky, sleek ""Afro Ken Doko Mien"" and ""Casio (Yak Nda Nda),"" Williams sings in Ibibio – a language she spoke primarily while growing up in Nigeria. Her fluid delivery and energy turn the aforementioned cuts into tight, elastic soundscapes; meanwhile the yearning, brassy ""All That You Want"" and the late-night Moroder-influenced ""Wanna See Your Face Again"" prove that the group can deliver strait-laced dancefloor bangers with ease.    As Ibibio Sound Machine have continually kept their lyrics insightful, honest and political in nature, Williams mostly promotes a level of positivity throughout the album, using the extroverted delivery of ""Freedom"" as an act of protest. On  Electricity , Ibibio Sound Machine manage to come across as enormously focused and imaginative while staying true to their wildly diverse, free-flowing modus operandi.  ( Merge )                           ALBUM   SOUL & FUNK   DANCE AND ELECTRONIC   MUSIC   REVIEWS              More Ibibio Sound Machine",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/ibibio_sound_machine_electricity_album_review

The Philadelphia quartet force audiences to think about privilege within hardcore music while also creating space for those whose voices the genre has long pushed to the sidelines.  Diaspora Problems  is Soul Glo's crowning achievement to date, combining hardcore with hip-hop, elements of extreme metal and heavy electronic music to create truly a unique listening experience.    From a musical standpoint,  Diaspora Problems  takes hardcore music and sprinkles in some wonderful oddities. The album opens with ""Gold Chain Punk (whogonbeatmyass),"" the heaviest Soul Glo song to date, including the most chaotic breakdowns ever written by the band.    The tracks that follow each put unique twists on Soul Glo's sound while keeping hardcore as their guiding principle. Whether its the horn sections on ""Thumbsucker,"" the death metal-infused ending of ""Fucked Up If True"" or the major Death Grips energy on ""Driponomics,"" Soul Glo are putting their own imprint on hardcore. This is perhaps never more apparently than on album closer ""Spiritual Level of Gang Shit,"" which mashes up the excellent vocal flow of guests like McKinley Dixon and lojii with atonal blast beats and distortion, feeling like a culmination and celebration of everything that came before it on the album.    Vocalist Pierce Jordan delivers stellar performances across  Diaspora Problems . This is a thematically dense record that tackles everything from the politics of hardcore to self-worth to generational trauma. The album is so densely packed with context that sitting down and pouring over the lyrics is strongly recommended. This is especially true of ""Driponomics,"" featuring vivid lines like, ""40 years of Reaganomics / The world in service and shit / Deliver food we spit in / Can't even cook for they kids.""    Jordan contributes just as much musically as he does contextually, contrasting against his bandmates with interesting rhythms on ""GODBLESSYALLREALGOOD"" and ""(Five Years And) My Family."" Jordan has moments like this continually throughout the record, making the music even more dynamic and rewarding listeners who make continual revisits of the album.    Exploring so many sub-genres of hardcore while simultaneously telling many different stories,  Diaspora Problems  vaults Soul Glo into the conversation as one of the most important heavy bands in 2022.

For  the Weather Station 's Tamara Lindeman, the answer has been in her back pocket this whole time. Arriving 13 months after  year-end-list staple   Ignorance ,  How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars  was written at the same time as her acclaimed fifth LP and recorded live off the floor in three days in March 2020. In Lindeman's words, ""I think of it almost as the moon to  Ignorance 's sun, the exhale at the end of the phrase.""     How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars  is a quiet album. There's Lindeman, her piano and faint wisps of additional, jazz-inflected lap steel and woodwinds like the colours of a fading sunset. Where Lindeman is often flanked by two ( and sometimes three ) percussionists when performing songs from  Ignorance , here, there is no percussion.     What's left are gentle piano ballads that are filled with deeply intimate moments and thoughts. Not the moments that you shout about or throw a party for, but the everyday events and musings that make a life. There's dancing, walks are taken, stars and birds are gazed at, a head rests on a lover's chest. Many of the topics Lindeman grapples with on  Ignorance ,  including the climate crisis , are present here too, but delivered with a softer touch. On ""Endless Time,"" Lindeman reflects on how precarious our lives are in the shadow of climate change. ""They don't put that in the paper, you won't read it in the news,"" she reminds us. ""You have to use your eyes.""    On  How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars , Lindeman also touches on the act of songwriting itself, which makes listening to the record feel as if you are witnessing the creative process of not only this collection of songs but of  Ignorance  as well. ""I'm tired of working all night long, trying to fit this world into a song,"" she sings on ""To Talk About."" But just because  How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars  is unadorned doesn't mean it feels unfinished. By design, these songs are understated but Lindeman's voice is so strong and incredibly beautiful that what she gives you is fulsome. Paired with the album's multitudinous lyrical details, Lindeman delicately succeeds in fitting the world into her songs.

2022-03-02,Kaelen Bell,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",​Nilüfer Yanya Finds Colour Amidst the Greys on 'PAINLESS',,"In his posthumously released 1996 children's book  My Many Coloured Days , Dr. Seuss wrote that, on bright blue days he flapped his wings; on yellow days he was a bee; on orange a circus seal. But of grey days, Seuss wrote, ""Everything is grey. I watch. But nothing moves today.""    The illustrated book is based on a manuscript that Seuss wrote in 1974; the following year, German visual artist Gerhard Richter would write in a letter to Dutch museum director Edy de Wilde that the colour grey ""evokes neither feelings nor associations… It has the capacity that no other colour has, to make 'nothing' visible.""     Nearly five decades later,  Nilüfer Yanya  offers her own album-length rumination on grey and its multitudes of nothing.  PAINLESS , the London songwriter's nervy second full-length, is an account of in-betweens and half-feelings; the unflinching "" LESS "" of its title is not a declaration of pleasure but an oath of numbness.     Yanya is no stranger to the vexations of grey matter. On 2019's fuzzed-out ""In Your Head,"" she sang of being ""dark and confused / Oh, though I cannot tell if I'm paranoid / Or it's all in my head."" Her florid debut,  Miss Universe , was a portrait of anxiety and disquiet before anything else, but its coterie of distinctive collaborators and an unnecessary conceptual framework — ""cloaks and sleeves,"" in Yanya's own words — threatened to swallow her writing. On  PAINLESS , Yanya whittles her sound to an essential minimalism, offering an unobstructed peephole into the Ames room of her mind.     The record is defined by figurative greys. Finite conclusions are rarely drawn, and Yanya often finds herself grappling with debilitating self-doubt, singing from a haze of indecision and mistrust — of lovers, of the world, of her own mind. Read on paper, the album's lyrics — ""Troubled don't count the ways I'm broken""; ""You can hurt me if you feel like""; ""Does sadness pick you to the bone?"" — can be brutal in their forthrightness and despair.     But, as Richter noted in a 1986 interview on his series of grey paintings, this nothingness ""has to be turned on its head in the end, and has to come to a form where these paintings possess beauty."" Crucially, Yanya understands this principal too, streaking her grey days with invigorating neon. For all its fear and itching paranoia,  PAINLESS  is a buzzing thrill.     Built mostly on looped, inflexible drum beats and Yanya's inspired guitar playing,  PAINLESS  sheds much of the jazz and R&B of her earlier work in favour of industrial-flavoured rock music. Last year, she  covered PJ Harvey's ""Rid of Me"" in an at-home performance for KEXP . The energy of that rendition — equal parts icy and impassioned — informs the sonic world crafted by Yanya and co-writer and producer Wilma Archer. The essence of Harvey's early music is there in the bluesy, sour riffs that power ""L/R,"" while the glitching, foreground-filling beat of ""Chase Me"" echoes the British icon's synthetic experiments on 1998's  Is This Desire?     Elsewhere, Yanya channels Radiohead circa  In Rainbows  on towering centrepiece ""Midnight Sun,"" while aquamarine closer ""Anotherlife"" plays like a spritely reimagining of the Blue Nile's nocturnal synth pop. Mostly though, Yanya just sounds like herself, subsuming these myriad influences into her own exacting palette of rigid beats and nimble guitar. Just as muscle memory can take you through the motions regardless of your mind's disarray — ""Sometimes it feels like you're so violent / autopilot,"" Yanya sings on ""L/R"" — these concise, aerodynamic songs bely the diffuse turmoil of her inner dialogue. On ""The Mystic"" she's ""not halfway up to speed,"" while over the needlework guitar of ""Stabilise"" she admits that she ""could feel something / But it could be nothing.""    Yanya rarely deals in black and white on  PAINLESS , but when she does — as on the Jazzi Bobbi-assisted ""Belong with You"" — she swings between the poles with an exhilarating, contradictory violence. ""Please don't cry / I run out of patience,"" Yanya sings on the tightly coiled opening verse, followed by the record's most objectively beautiful put-down: ""Sick of this / I don't even like you bitch."" But then, as if grafted from a devotional ballad, comes the chorus, repeated with a wild-eyed intensity: ""I belong with you.""    To her credit, Yanya never attempts to meld these warring ideas. She allows herself to snap like a rubber band between perspectives until, as the song careens to a close, she faces the inevitable crash: ""I said there won't be a next time / But now I can't see the stop sign.""     Nothing moves on a grey day. But in that stillness the heart continues to pound and flutter; the skin tingles and the brain weathers invisible storms. The power of  PAINLESS  is its willingness to stand in the eye of that unseen hurricane, submerging itself in disorientation and contradiction and unknowing.

2022-03-02,Alan Ranta,9,"POP AND ROCK,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Maylee Todd's 'Maloo' Is a Path to a Brighter Future,,"Throughout her career,  Maylee Todd  has delivered her outsider-pop quirks with heavy dose of whimsy, evident as early as her 2010 debut  Choose Your Own Adventure , which brimmed with Stereolab-esque playfulness.  Maloo , her fourth album and first for Peanut Butter Wolf's famed Stones Throw Records, is a collection of science fiction lullabies from the perspective of her digital avatar, after whom the album was named.     Formerly from Toronto and currently creating in Los Angeles, Todd became enamoured with the positive possibilities of virtual reality during the pandemic, envisioning a sort of social media alternative focused on amplifying our shared dreams rather than reinforcing status symbols. As such, she imbued  Maloo  with a utopian technological vision, the likes of which  Grimes' AI girl group  and the robots from Björk's ""All is Full of Love"" video might conceive if they dreamed about a children's album with Kid Koala instead of electric sheep.    While  Maloo  is Todd's most musically and conceptually sophisticated album to date, the hints of absurdity expressed in the lyrics and melodies harken back to  Choose Your Own Adventure . The title of that album — sonically steeped in bossa nova, folk and soul — was a major clue as to her provocative style, taken from an interactive series of printed books where the reader makes choices on behalf of the stories' protagonists. As Todd walks listeners through the limitless possibilities of  Maloo , she shows how that foundational idea has evolved from analog paper to the digital cloud.     Maloo  trends more into late-'90s Björk territory with modern advancements, flush with jewelry box melodies that feel warm despite their obvious processing. The dreamy instrumental ""Tiny Chiffon"" sounds like the background music from a highly emotional  Final Fantasy  cutscene or a Mort Garson song inspired by an autogenerated houseplant. The sultry sway of ""No Other"" takes Erykah Badu to the outer space cuddle puddle, while the softness of ""Dream with You"" brings to mind Supersempfft's optimistic kosmiche-pop. All of the songs are distinct in style, yet the common threads in their sounds and imagery really tie the room together. Like a calmer alternative to King Gizzard's  Nonagon Infinity ,  Maloo  plays well on repeat, and it's so interesting that it is a joy to let it ride three or four times in a session, picking out different gestures and moments each time.    The lullaby concept is translated rather literally as well. Todd mentions lucid dreaming in ""Age of Energy,"" the opening track that builds the world in which  Maloo  exists. Later on, she explicitly explores dreaming in ""Dream with You,"" a trippy love ballad near the album's end. Those tracks bookend the record with the kind of 'existence is wrapped in a dream' feeling that arguably held together the surreal rotoscope-animated vignettes of Richard Linklater's  Waking Life .    Further embracing technology, Todd directed  a trippy 360-degree virtual reality video for ""Infinite Program,""  created in collaboration with Kyvita. Set to a woozy, atmospheric, vaguely tropical tune, the lyrics speak of a sort of sentient planet like Stanisław Lem's  Solaris , but less haunting and more empathetic. The health of Todd's planet is tapped into the psyche of its inhabitants, so when their mental health suffers, so does the environment. To heal oneself is to heal the world; to hate is to destroy it.    Though bathed in the fantasy of science fiction, her words contain the key for reality to move forward. In her dreams, technology brings people together rather than tearing them apart. As such,  Maloo  isn't just an avatar or an album. It's a path to a brighter future.

2022-03-03,Bruno Coulombe,8,"JAZZ,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Thus Owls' 'Who Would Hold You If The Sky Betrayed Us?' Soars on Woodwind Wings,,"Thus Owls  are a rare gem in the Montreal music scene, one that keeps making music according to their own terms. This statement rings especially true with their fifth full-length,  Who Would Hold You If the Sky Betrayed Us? , an expansive double-album rooted in avant-garde jazz, improvisation and experimental rock that challenges you to rethink your expectations of what an indie band should sound like.      Previously released 2018 effort  The Mountain That We Live Upon  showcased the power of the six-string, with a lineup that featured four guitarists resulting in thick, multi-layered textures. This time, the husband-and-wife duo of Erika and Simon Angell decided to focus on the timbre of the saxophone to provide their new release with a distinct sonic identity. The result is a bit unconventional for a modern rock album, although the influence of  David Bowie 's  Blackstar  (acknowledged by the band) looms large.      As much as the sound of Thus Owls relies on the chemistry of the Angells, the guest performers are the real stars here. Saxophonists Claire Devlin (tenor), Adam Kinner (tenor) and Jason Sharp (bass sax) play an essential role in shaping these 13 new compositions, often providing the basic melodic material on which the music is built. Tracks like ""Balconies"" and ""Who Would Hold You?"" illustrate this perfectly, with labyrinthine brass lines that reveal the influence of both post-bop jazz and the American minimalist school of  Terry Riley  and  Steve Reich .      Elsewhere, the band alternates between progressive psychedelia and languid trip-hop. ""I Forget What I Remembered"" first echoes  Portishead  with its steady, slow beat, before the sax harmonies turn it into something that wouldn't have been out of place on  King Crimson 's  Lizard . Opener ""Bleeding"" is another strong number, harking back to the prog-folk movement of the 1970s, but with the brass providing more abrasive orchestrations. Throughout the record, long-time collaborator Samuel Joly proves especially versatile on drums, capable of shifting from a jazzy, cymbal-driven sound to something more pounding when the mood commands it.      With its 66-minute running time,  Who Would Hold You If the Sky Betrayed Us?  leaves ample room for improvisation, and the band takes full advantage of that. On ""Above the Sun,"" Simon Angell channels the guitar hero in him with a shredding solo, while ""Perfectly Younger"" embraces cacophony in an almost  Ornette Coleman  manner. Yes, there are a few eccentricities here and there in terms of virtuosic display, but nothing that feels like plain overindulgence.      Despite some jarring stylistic shifts, the album maintains its coherence thanks to the deep, slightly raspy voice of Erika Angell which acts like a guiding presence. Some of the lyrics were obviously tainted by the pandemic, and songs like ""Lover Mother"" and ""I Miss Her Like My Country"" reflect on her feelings of being isolated from her Swedish family during that time.      Thus Owls appear to have been rejuvenated since the release in 2015 of their  Black Matter   EP, on which they started to let go of the more indie folk aesthetics of their previous work. Instead, they've embraced a more ambitious sound with elaborate and intricate arrangements, proving that the harder it is to categorize music, the better it usually is. There's no point in trying to decide if  Who Would Hold You If the Sky Betrayed Us?  is jazz or rock. It's both of these things, and much more.

2022-03-03,Leslie Ken Chu,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Scott Hardware Upgrades His Compositional Mind with 'Ballad of a Tryhard',,"Scott Hardware 's third full-length,  Ballad of a Tryhard , is the Toronto artist's most sprawling, beautiful album yet. On 2016's  Mutate Repeat Infinity , he relied on techno-sourced repetition and as little instrumentation as necessary to liven up a dance floor. 2020's  Engel   found Hardware combining decaying electronics and baroque pop. In these ways, both albums drew listeners into an intimate space, like a club or cavernous performance hall.  Ballad  takes Hardware's craft to new heights of sophistication and richness, establishing him as a master of melody, an exquisite popsmith, and a brilliant compositional mind.     Ballad  is a Polaroid collection of a sojourn to the coastal city of Elche, Spain, where Hardware spent weeks wandering historic streets and playing piano until sunup. Each of the album's 10 songs is a suite in and of itself, built around acoustic and stringed instrumentation which grants them a tangibility less present in the synthetic pulsations of Mutate Repeat Infinity, and even the avant-pop of  Engel . ""Summer"" and ""Is Something Wrong Tonight?"" burst forward and upward in full symphonic glory and splendour. Bass notes lilt like plants in the heat on ""Another Day Ending""; coupled with vaporous keys, the song is as sultry as a Mediterranean evening, the very ambience in which Hardware steeped himself.     Musically,  Ballad  paints an ambrosial picture of a European tryst, like scenes of  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy at their most smitten in  Richard Linklater's  Before  trilogy. But Hardware's lyrics dispel any  romantic fantasies.  Time slows down, allowing him to attain some respite  —  ""I won't say a thing / No, the quiet's more powerful / And you can get lost at the top of your mountain,"" he sings on the cloudbusting, harpsichord-powered ""Dentera""  — b ut it's not enough. On the slippery ""Watersnake,"" a ghost from his past interrupts his flickers of serenity. Along with his personal relationships, he's unable to find sustained peace knowing that the world at large  — the Earth and the human species that inhabits it —  is on the brink of disaster. He struggles to not let these circumstances or unwelcome presences knock him off the summit of peace he's scaled.     A sense of fatalism pervades  Ballad . It's even embedded in a shrugging song title like ""Another Day Ending."" But Hardware isn't passive. He's determined to ride life to its fullest  despite  the circumstances.  ""September you don't scare me / I'm in no hurry / Let sand sift through my hands / Do I look worried?"" he challenges on the uneasy ""Metaterranean."" He also displays determination  —  and resilience  —  when he sings, ""Come on, light / Kiss my eyes / Call my name / In the crowd / I can wait / 'Cause I've waited / I can climb and crawl to find my way tonight"" on ""Another Day Ending.""     Hardware also finds a sense of connection on  Ballad  absent in his  previous albums, both of which expressed feelings of isolation and alienation . On ""Love Through the Trees,"" he sings, ""If I'm with you, I feel my edges soften / We both know that don't come around that often."" And if not with people, he at least finds oneness with the world around him. ""I'm alone / I don't mind it / And no work / Just the quiet / I take a breath, and I see / The room is taking breaths with me,"" he observes on ""Another Day Ending.""     Fraught with inner turmoil but contrasted by soaring, uplifting music and rare moments of contentedness,  Scott Hardware spends  Ballad of a Tryhard  trying to relish in tranquility while bracing himself as the world crumbles around him. When it comes to developing as a songwriter, though,  Ballad  is one more  stepping stone to achieving an artistry that's as indefinable as it is unpredictable.

2022-03-04,Mark Tremblay,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Vein.fm Hone Their Melodic Might on 'This World Is Going to Ruin You',,"Sophomore albums are never a pleasant process.  Vein.fm 's debut,  Errorzone , was so well-received by the hardcore community (even topping Exclaim!'s list of  Best Metal and Hardcore Albums of 2018 ) that a follow-up would appear to be a daunting task.  This World Is Going to Ruin You  uses familiar hardcore tropes while taking big swings at larger, anthemic moments, capturing the expansion of a young band's sonic palate that, for the most part, pays off immensely.    On their second album, Vein.fm have taken care in mapping out a sonic experience for the listener. The record's sequencing leads breakdowns on songs like ""Lights Out"" to stand out amongst more sonically mellow turns, such as ""Wherever You Are"" and ""Wavery."" Individually, these subdued songs on the record do not seem particularly impactful when played out of album order. When mixed in amongst the chaos, however, these melody driven songs really propel the listen forward, breaking up the heaviness nicely.    For fans of panic chords and breakdowns, Vein.fm have some of their best to  This World Is Going to Ruin You , showcasing seasoned craft and execution on ""The Killing Womb"" and ""Orgy in The Morgue."" Drummer Matt Wood has some of his best performances on this record, highlighted by his blast beats on ""Versus Wyoming"" and his intricate patterns throughout ""Inside Design.""    Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of  This World Is Going to Ruin You  is its variety of melodic choruses, some of which land a bit flat. A performance from  Thursday 's Geoff Rickly on ""Fear in Non Fiction"" feels out place, sapping the song of its momentum. Considering the song's chaotic build-up, this vocal performance as the payoff feels anti-climatic and disappointing. Similarly, the chorus of ""Magazine Beach"" is very jarring, feeling forced and unnatural.    It is commendable to see Vein.fm incorporate these larger melodic moments, and in spite of varying results, not all of them are subpar. The haunting, beautiful album closer ""Funeral Sound"" is the album's finest track. Featuring sparse piano and faint vocals, the band triumphantly meld Deftones-indebted melodies into their punishing brand of hardcore.                 This World Is Going to Ruin You  feels like a peek into the future of what Vein.fm are going to become. While not everything works out as intended, the seeds have been sown for growth and refinement. The album does a great job of acknowledging the band's past, and where one can expect them to move forward.

2022-03-08,Leslie Ken Chu,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Vancouver Underground Heroes Apollo Ghosts Go Widescreen on 'Pink Tiger',,"Apollo Ghosts  have long been the beating heart of independent music in Vancouver. Since forming in 2008, they've become renowned for their festive live shows from coast to coast, powered by four LPs and a scattering of EPs, including 2010's Polaris long listed  Mount Benson  — all with a six-year gap in their tenure, as they disbanded between 2013 and 2019. Three years later, their  celebrated comeback  has reached a new peak with their most ambitious effort yet, their first double album,  Pink Tiger .    The album was written over those three years, which were marked by loss. Singer-guitarist  Adrian Teacher 's father was dying. Teacher lost hearing in one ear. Nature was hurting from wildfires, land development and resource extraction. But with time, Teacher's hearing returned. He planted trees with his partner Amanda P., who's also Apollo Ghosts' drummer (though Brutal Poodle's Dustin B. has assumed that role live). Their bassist Robbie N. is having a baby this spring. The life cycle goes on.     Pink Tiger  reflects the seesawing of life's highs and lows in two distinct sides, evenly split into 11 tracks each. The first,  Pink , is comprised of acoustic home recordings that grapple with helplessness and confusion in the wake of loss. Knitting an acoustic melody around piano, ""Melatonin 5G"" speaks to the album's preoccupation with beginnings and endings: ""I severed all my ties / With all the stupid things that went wrong in my life / And I took a trip with some friends."" The warm embrace of the  title track 's piano and acoustic guitar offers all the tenderness of the Mountain Goats'  Get Lonely . ""All of these comforts / All of these lies and fire pit philosophies / Hoping for answers / Talking with God,"" a soul-searching Teacher sings, trying to wrap his head around the way the universe works before he musters gratitude and an optimistic outlook: ""Friends are family,"" he sings. ""Maybe it's over / Maybe it's not.""    Elsewhere, a ragged weariness drapes over  Pink . Finger-picking, a steely guitar tone, and a freely flowing melody tinge ""Morning Voice"" with American Primitivism, though they're offset by evaporating keys. On ""Dirty Spoons,"" Teacher's voice dangles so low that it borders on a Bill Callahan impression; the sparing track even lingers like one of the Smog singer's placid, reflective songs.    For the album's second half,  Tiger , Apollo Ghosts enlisted the recording talent of Jordan Koop (Orville Peck, Wolf Parade) at the Noise Floor and the mixing expertise of JC/DC Studios' David Carswell (Destroyer, the New Pornographers). Whereas  Pink Tiger 's entire first half feels like a long, slow breath — there's a moment on ""To Set the King Bloom"" when the music winds down to a pause, Teacher inhales deeply, and he begins again, patiently rebuilding the song — ""Tiger"" boasts energetic guitar rock that mostly looks past grief and toasts the joys of life, namely friendship and music.    Though  Tiger  contains no chantable anthems, one of Apollo Ghosts' specialties, it packs plenty of catchy moments and the band's other defining characteristics. Teacher continues to spin keen observations into sharp musings. ""When you've got fuck all inside you / You'll finally have something to say,"" he sings on the unhurried ""Spilling Yr Guts."" And in his hands, nostalgia is never a bad word — like much of Apollo Ghosts' work,  Pink Tiger  brims with youthful reminiscences and often finds him searching for home. Riding a coast-cool, groove, ""Island Kids"" encapsulates this spirit and yearning. The song's  music video  was filmed on Protection Island, which holds a special place in Teacher's heart. The song, he says, is an elegy to a halcyon type of childhood that feels increasingly less common.    Dashed hopes and unrealized ambitions run free in Apollo Ghosts' music. The band usually treats them playfully, without so much as a wistful smile, let alone a defeatist attitude, but their approach is more sobering on  Pink 's ""But I'll Be Around Then (Acoustic Version)"" and  Tiger 's ""But I'll Be Around (Electric Version)."" ""Perfect life will make it happen / Haven't seemed to get there yet,"" Amanda sings, taking over lead vocals on the acoustic version while Teacher resumes vocal duties on its electric counterpart. But the duo are hopeful, concluding, ""Peace of mind / Happens all the time.""    Spanning a spectrum of emotions and musical styles,  Pink Tiger  presents Apollo Ghosts in top form. Adrian Teacher has always been a vivid storyteller, but his openness and frankness on  Pink Tiger  is unparalleled by the rest of Apollo Ghosts' discography. Even though they don't hit all their usual revelrous notes, they've stretched their canvas and expanded their palette, adding whole new depth to their already venerated repertoire.

2022-03-08,Riley Wallace,5,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",Kanye West's 'Donda 2' Isn't Finished Yet — but It Might Not Be Fixable,,"In a world where fans have waited nearly five years for a follow-up to Kendrick Lamar's Pulitzer Prize-winning  DAMN.  or close to two decades for an André 3000 solo effort, there was something oddly freeing about the rollout of  Kanye West 's  Donda  sequel.    Barely letting the dust settle after its chart-topping predecessor,  V2.22.22 MIAMI  — the current release of the album otherwise known as  Donda 2  — is a noticeably unfinished album. It's  only officially available on Ye's own Stem Player device , where listeners can manipulate the tracks to their liking. This makes fans a part of Ye's creative process — an engaging idea in theory, even if the the Stem Player's $200 USD price point is quite steep for the average listener. The Stem Player itself is an innovative creative product, another example of Ye's trailblazing — the music on  Donda 2  is less so.    As it currently stands,  Donda 2  is very much a reflection of Ye's mindset as expressed in his recent online exploits, largely inspired by his divorce from Kim Kardashian. He is far from the first man to be engrossed in a separation that involves children. Still, he is arguably the most popular, and he continues to use his platform to lob uncomfortably  one-sided jabs at Kardashian and her new boyfriend, Pete Davidson . While his heart may be in the right place (in his mind), the messaging gets more than a little mixed up as the tracklist progresses, not unlike the Instagram post-and-delete madness we got leading up to the album.    For example, on ""True Love,"" featuring the late  XXXTentacion , Ye takes shots at Kardashian and laments the emotional, frustrating realities of co-parenting under hostility (something he's, y'know, contributing toward). It's a sharp juxtaposition to a much more menacing ""Security,"" where he appears to be threatening the safety of anyone standing between him and the nuclear family structure he's trying to regain. It's hard not to see this directed at Davidson, who has become one of the most prominent opps of Ye's career, up there with Taylor Swift and big tech. It's an incredibly harsh song to have out in the world during a divorce proceeding.    Then, even more jarring, is ""Flowers,"" which can be taken two ways. While the chorus feels like a reference to the extravagant Valentine's Day gift Ye sent Kardashian, he appears to be addressing a new acquaintance — assuring her that he is the literal pinnacle she will ever reach. That's quite off-brand, considering the bulk of  Donda 2 's crux and his personal narrative of late.    Not that the album is unfinished to the point it's entirely unsatisfying; there are clear winners here. Kanye bares his soul against Don Toliver's angelic vocals on ""Broken Road,"" and Vory's feature on ""Lord Lift Me Up"" gives an unmistakably orchestral feel. ""We Did It,"" featuring  Migos  and  Baby Keem , is a rare bright moment in what feels like an otherwise dark tracklist, standing as a clear highlight on the album, while NYC ode ""City of Gods"" stands as the most fully realized track. As usual, his curation of guests is vital, at points carrying Ye's incomplete verses (which are often hampered by mumbly placeholders). The  Future -featuring ""Keep It Burning"" and  Jack Harlow -aided ""Louie Bags"" both feel like potentially great tracks that weren't ready to come out of the oven yet.    The first instalment of  Donda  used elements of Ye's late mother's voice to help stitch together a thematic narrative, and that sense of tribute gets lost in the sequel. Instead, he's submerged in his divorce. On ""Sci-Fi,"" he samples Kardashian's vocals and recalls ""[giving her] the semen"" before asking her to choose between oxygen or Wi-Fi— while also stating that he's recusing himself (from a public situation he is in fact driving) for his own sanity. He follows that up with ""Selfish,"" a song that sees him reassert his newfound musical independence while again harkening back to the sense of loneliness he is currently feeling.    It's possibly his most focused tracklist in recent memory; it's a voyeuristic look into a dark period in his timeline. Ye isn't happy — he says it himself more than once. The result is timely music that, for better or worse, captures this moment, despite not having any real high-powered hits or us being mixed and mastered to the level of his most revered work.    It does open up a new world, allowing fans access to clean stems. This could result in better remixes and mashups from a wide variety of listeners — whether it's producers building around the existing elements or artists adding their verses to glaring gaps in songs like ""True Love"" or ""Too Easy.""     Even in the eyes of his die-hard fans, this feels like an accurate indicator of a project that will ultimately play in the same sandbox, albeit with some changed instrumentation and — hopefully — fleshed out songs. Dark times often lead to fantastic art. However, for Ye, the intersection of striking while the iron's hot has resulted in a rushed body of work. Things are happening in real-time — for example,  his March 5 ""divorce"" post , with a caption including lines like, ""Divorce feels like your kids were snatched from your control / Divorce feels like you've been shot and traffic is slow,"" which feels like an inevitable future addition to this project. But, whether tinkering can add some sorely missing replay value to  Donda 2  remains to be seen.

2022-03-10,Kaelen Bell,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Jenny Hval Deconstructs the Myth of Creation on 'Classic Objects',,"""Look at these trees / Look at this grass / Look at those clouds,"" intoned the Observatory's Vivian Wang at the outset of  Jenny Hval 's 2019 record  The Practice of Love . She continued, surveying a moist, minuscule universe of mushrooms and small blue flowers: ""Study this and ask yourself / Where is God?""     ""Cemetery of Splendour"" — the clicking, chirruping centrepiece of  Hval's latest record,  Classic Objects  — finds the Norwegian avant-pop sorcerer in a similar state of wonderment. ""Trees, stick, rocks / Bamboo leaf / Bamboo leaf again / Then the branch / The branch / The pinecone!"" she says giddily, a smile stretching her words like taffy. ""And the birds, in the distance / Gum, gum, gum! / Cigarette butts / Candy wrapper / A button.""     Gone is Wang's cool stoicism, Hval's gentle cadence recalling the joyous freedom of Life Without Buildings' Sue Tompkins. Gone, too, is the solitude of Wang's observation; her sombre curiosity at the holy absence of human intrusion. Surrounded by bodily imprints and interloping garbage, Hval revels in the currents of human movement at a place reserved for the departed. ""Shoes came here / And here / And here / Someone once laid down here"" — though she stands in a courtyard of death, all she sees is life.    Hval's work has never shied from humanity and the pulse of living. Her albums peer, often and unafraid, into the wet depths of the body and brain. But the intimate humanity of  Classic Objects  feels like something else. Warm, loose and occupied by the realities of creative work and the contradictory comfort of our ""normcore institutions,"" it manages to be Hval's most accessible record yet. It fearlessly holds her seemingly divergent identities — artist and worker, partner and provocateur, realist and dreamer — beneath the same glittering disco ball.    The jubilant graveyard walk of ""Cemetery of Splendour"" encapsulates the tone — both musically and thematically — of  Classic Objects  as a whole. Hval has never stayed in one lane for long, and  Classic Objects  finds her eschewing the trance-indebted throb of  The Practice of Love  for percussive, guitar-and-keys led pop music. There are traces of  Graceland 's rhythmic jamboree and Talk Talk's patient quietude, but Hval's unmistakable voice and inimitable melodies make comparisons feel more or less obsolete. The album shimmers and floats with a wide-eyed delight, as though Hval and her players are performing several feet above the ground. The blue sky of the album's artwork is an obvious touchstone for its sonic world.    The patchwork diorama positioned below that sky is integral too — beneath a monument of clarity and freedom sits a piece of physical structure, all seams and glue and human intention.  Classic Objects  is about many things, but it is mostly about the mechanics of creation. Specifically, the labour that churns behind that creation, and the place where work and art and self become inextricable from one another — ""There was a painter / In my first studio space / That I remember / She used to attach / Her own hair / To her paintings,"" Hval sings over the rolling hand drums of the title track.    Amid the cascading harp of ""Freedom,"" Hval pines for ""somewhere where art is free / Not that it ever was."" The song is a prayer of sorts, for a place where expression is genuinely as liberating as it sometimes feels, and where autonomy, creative or otherwise, is never a question — ""When I listen deep / I'm not my owner / Maybe I never was."" In the Zia Anger-directed video for ""Jupiter,"" an overworked, underpaid video crew piles into a hot air balloon, floating in precarity while Hval sings, ""Sometimes art is more real / More evil / Just lonelier / Just so lonely."" The myth of the tortured artist has long been outmoded, but what of the artist as inexhaustible freewheeler? Work is work regardless of the goal, Hval reminds us again and again on  Classic Objects , as she attempts to dismantle the fantastical, biblical whiff that lingers on creation.    Hval's dedication to the unseen — exposing the sweat and scaffolding, the trash nestled in the grass — extends to her own self-creation, as she surveys the cognizant makeup of her life. Over the incessant chime and staccato guitar of opening track ""Year of Love,"" she recounts the story of her self-consciously low-stakes marriage — ""'It's just for contractual reasons,' I explained / Signing the papers"" — before recalling the time a man proposed to a woman in front of her at her own concert. The act instantly deflates the haven of unfamiliarity, the ""multitudes of colours,"" that she was attempting to conjure from stage, and she is incredulous that she's suddenly become a heterosexual proposal soundtrack against her will. But she'd done the same after all, simply stripped of the spectacle and saccharine romance — ""I am giving it my voice / But then again / I already did / Oh, already did,"" she sings as the song surges around her.    The album's crown jewel — dug up, cut and painstakingly buffed — is the irrepressible groove of ""American Coffee,"" where Hval wonders at the places where fate and autonomy commingle to create a life. Who is the other Jenny, the one who chose a different sort of labour, a different set of flavours? ""I wonder who I'd be if I'd never got to go / Get a fine arts degree / And American coffee,"" she sings, holding this other self — the one unafraid to drive, the one so versed in normality — against a backdrop of choral coos, silver-toned organ and burbling percussion.

2022-03-10,Michael Di Gennaro,7,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Alex Cameron Confronts Addiction with Care on 'Oxy Music',,"Australian-born  Alex Cameron  is best described as music's answer to  Danny McBride . Cameron is as much a fiction author as he is a singer, and the majority of his discography consists of vignettes penned from the perspective of the type of men that McBride embodies in his characters, whether it be Kenny Powers or Jesse Gemstone. They're crude, perverted, and constantly trying to cover up their self-loathing with arrogance. Both Cameron and McBride use the satirization of these characters for humour and social commentary, but there's also a sense of empathy in their writing; if they had just make a couple correct decisions and had a strong mentor in their life, things could've turned out different. Yet, their characters never cash in on the opportunities to change for the better, and become increasingly isolated from friends, family, and society as a result.     Isolation is an especially strong theme across Cameron's discography. Whether speaking from a down-and-out character he's formulated or passionately defending sex workers, he clearly sees isolation as a serious ailment, one that can have disastrous psychological consequences. Those ideas translate to  Oxy Music , but the difference is that Cameron seems to be far more sympathetic for his characters this time around.    It's partly because he's no longer talking about the sleaziest, creepiest guy you can think about. Inspired by the homeless addicts he saw while living in New York and Nico Walker's autofictional book  Cherry , the majority of the record sees Cameron playing the role of a drug addict, delving into the ostracism that comes with the abuse of opioids. He sings about being afraid of his parents finding bruises on his arms on ""Hold The Line,"" and tells his lover to leave him if he ever overdoses on ""Breakdown."" When he says. ""there's only room for one in the k-hole,"" it summarizes home his thoughts toward addiction; that it affects everyone around the addict, and the distance it creates between them and their loved ones often creates a vicious cycle that leads them to use drugs even more.     When Cameron isn't talking about drug addiction on  Oxy Music , he's still focused on the topic of isolation. The two songs that open the record, ""Best Life"" and ""Sara Jo,"" speak about a different type of obsession, of being terminally online in the quarantine era. ""Sara Jo"" specifically is one of the best critiques of online culture in recent memory. ""One thing you do, is never fuck with my family,"" Cameron croons, before listing off ways that the internet has done just that. They've told his brother his kids will die from vaccination, a divisive tool of misinformation that has made plenty a family group chat a war zone. They've told his mother she's ugly, and his father that he doesn't need therapy no matter what. It's a different type of isolation than drug addiction, but a self-inflicted isolation nonetheless. In the misinformation era, anyone's confirmation bias can lead to them adopting an aggressive, dogmatic ideology that can range from hateful and dangerous, to simply unpleasant to be around.     Through all of these stories, Cameron is able to stray away from being preachy or judgemental the way he always has: through humor. He's not just a great writer, but an incredibly funny one, and similar to a great stand-up comedian, it makes it easy to listen to what he has to say. ""Cancel Culture"" is a cleverly-named song clearly meant to bait both the people who get excited to dogpile onto anything they deem Roganesque, and the people who are actively seeking out ""woke mob"" criticism — it ends up being a song about cultural appropriation. ""Prescription Refill"" comes off as the typical drug-love metaphor, but he's not talking about cocaine or heroin, and is likening the way his lover brightens their outlook on life to prescribed Transitions lenses. These moments serve to remind the listener that you never really know if Cameron is joking or being serious, if he's communicating his own feelings or those from a character he's dreamed up, and that despite the serious material on the record, he's still making music to have fun.     Cameron's subject matter takes up so much focus on  Oxy Music  that it can be hard to remember the other major part of it, the instrumentation. In a statement released alongside the LP, Cameron contends that his band ""is a band that can hang with any other band, dead or alive."" The arrangement and production on  Oxy Music  certainly backs that up on a technical level: the songs are performed perfectly, each part of a song perfectly in tune with the other. However, the songs do leave something to be desired compared to previous Cameron records. With albums like 2013's  Jumping the Shark  and 2017's  Forced Witness , the strong '80s influence that ran through the instrumentals behind Cameron complimented the characters he was writing: you could imagine them wearing suits with big collars, three or four buttons undone to show a gaudy necklace and an abundance of chest hair. The style of music took on the personality of the protagonist in that they were in their prime when it was most popular. On  Oxy Music , the synthpop and Springsteen worship seems to be more of a comfort-zone choice than anything else. It isn't bad by any stretch, but it doesn't elevate Cameron's performances or the immersion he attempts to create.     The lack of instrumental ambition does not stop  Oxy Music  from being an enjoyable, thought-provoking experience. It is not the first album to tackle the psyche of a drug addict, and it won't be the last. But it is the only album to address the issue from Alex Cameron's unique way of making music, and that alone makes it a worthwhile listen. It forces listeners to humanize addicts of all kinds, to think of the type of support they need in order to simply feel comfortable being around the people they love. With a opioid crisis tearing through the world, music that describes addicts as more than junkies is important. Sharing this is only part of the job: nobody wants to be lectured on how they need to care more about people they may not even know.  Oxy Music 's greatest strength is that it makes the plight of an addict easy to understand and sympathize with, and may even help addicts who tune in feel less alone.

2022-03-11,Alex Hudson,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",The Golden Age of Wrestling's 'Crossface Chicken Wing' Puts a Pop-Friendly Spin on Ambient Music,,"Vancouver songwriter and producer Jeff Cancade is probably best known for the electronic pop he makes as  Devours  — but as  the Golden Age of Wrestling , he (mostly) strips out the vocals and the beats, leaving poignant ambient synthscapes.    His sophomore album with the project,  Crossface Chicken Wing , is quietly beautiful, with pop hooks that emerge from an atmospheric haze of bleary arpeggiators and warped voices. Opening track ""i miss eating big league chew and watching nitro in the basement of your old house"" sets the tone with misty-eyed nostalgia evoked by echoing synth chords and refrain of ""I'm in the prime of my life."" With a kick and a snare, this song could have been a full-blown bubblegum anthem; instead, it's a softly gorgeous meditation on childhood.    Similarly, ""rottweiler"" has an eighth-note synth pulse that resembles an ambient remix of a new wave banger, while late-album standouts ""purgatory for vancouver buzz bands"" and ""koala kisses"" anchor their abstractions with satisfying synth melodies.    While the album is largely instrumental, the track titles offer some hints about the music: ""body shots montage"" is as warped and wobbly as an all-night bender, and the feature appearance from Devours (yes — Cancade makes a cameo on his own album under an alias) adds a hint of pop accessibility to the song's middle section. The hazy arpeggios of ""16mm dream sequence"" are just as wistful as the title promises (albeit a bit spookier).    Occasionally weird and consistently inviting,  Crossface Chicken Wing  is a delicate balance, offering adventurous experimentalism without sacrificing the infectious accessibility Cancade is known for with Devours.

2022-02-17,Myles Tiessen,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Lavender Country's Roots Run Through Past and Present on 'Blackberry Rose',,"Country music is filled with iconography. Whether it be the archetypal wandering cowpoke on the range, rambling outlaw or the city-dwelling sweetheart, it's a genre where typology is as vital to the very essence of the music as any chord progression or lyrical allegory. Luckily for us, in 2022, we have a handful of country icons still kicking around. Arguably, the most relevant and influential for this current country music revival — or should I say  reformation shaped by the Yeehaw Agenda  — is the original queer-country darling Patrick Haggerty, a.k.a.  Lavender Country .    Now,  Blackberry Rose  is not what fans of Haggerty's disciples may be expecting. Those who follow in his footsteps  make country music that is more genre-fluid  than we have ever heard before. One might assume Haggerty would take a step towards modernism to play to the crowd that wants to listen to  Trixie Mattel  or  Orville Peck  but the most compelling aspect while listening to  Blackberry Rose  is that it sounds notably rooted in traditional forms of country music. There are blues numbers, bluegrass tracks, barn burners, and mournful ballads, all of which sound, well, old-school.     Blackberry Rose  isn't a glorification of the past, nor a ham-fisted reminder of country music's golden era. It exists, perfectly, in this decade. Haggerty shows his ability to tether the past to the present, and through his music, he can synthesize the complicated emotional turmoil of humankind. Or, more specifically, that of the queer community that he belongs to.    Haggerty doesn't take long to make this historical framework in which he operates known. He opens  Blackberry Rose  with a re-envisioning of ""I Can't Shake The Stranger Out of You"" that appeared on Lavender Country's 1973 self-titled debut. Like that first release, Haggerty stays political and intentionally remains outside the mainstream country music industry on  Blackberry Rose , shit-talking cops and calling out fascist politicians. In ""Clara Fraser, Clara Fraser,"" he takes on the persona of an antagonist who tries to undermine the acclaimed political organizer. ""Her politics ain't ladylike / I just can't stand her abrasive behaviour,"" sings the narrator over the whimsical, upbeat jig.    One of the most fun and playful songs is the smoky and musky ""Gay Bar Blues."" Haggerty expertly sets the scene, and you can perfectly imagine the rural honky-tonk dive bar in which the song exists. ""If I don't hook a dude, I'm gonna drown in wine coolers / I got the gay bar blues,"" sings Haggerty before the song breaks into a fierce fiddle solo working in tandem with a grungy guitar.    Country music is a genre of shared stories, and through the lending of lyrics, arrangements, and melodies, we find consolation in our solitude. Haggerty expresses this in a rather unique and humorous way in his reworking of Tammy Wynette's infamous ""Stand By Your Man."" Among certain interpretations, Wynette's song values a woman's uncritical submission to her husband regardless of transgression. But on  Blackberry Rose , it has been transformed into ""Stand On Your Man,"" and Haggerty, along with Nikki Grossman, takes Wynette's enduring melody and mutates the song into their own dynamic narrative about self-actualization and gender role reversal. ""If he gets sassy, you might have to kick his ass until he learns to jump at your command,"" Grossman sings confidently. It's the type of cheeky homage to country music history that Lavender Country did so well on their eponymous record almost 50 years ago.    Haggerty's political disposition may lean into the comical, but on the song ""Blackberry Rose,"" he uses a somber tone and his acute lyrical ability to tell the story of the lynching of a Black man who fell in love and started a family with a white woman in the early 1900s. In the ballad, Haggerty describes their relationship as ""The finest and tenderest you could ever find in humankind."" Ultimately, the white folks in the community tear the lovers apart, killing the Black man and the child. The narrative is reminiscent of Bob Dylan's ""Hattie Carroll,"" and uses historical truths to bring awareness to contemporary injustices.    And baby, in times like these, the world can be thankful for more music from Lavender Country.

2022-02-17,Alan Ranta,8,"EP,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Khruangbin and Leon Bridges' Southern Charm Never Wanes on 'Texas Moon',,"Texas is arguably best known for country music, but the Lone Star State has produced major contributors to a kaleidoscope of genres. It's a big state, and they do things big there. Consider the impact Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lightnin' Hopkins had on blues, or that which the Thirteenth Floor Elevators and Red Krayola had on psychedelic rock, or that of the Geto Boys and DJ Screw on hip-hop.  Khruangbin and Leon Bridges  have each added to that rich tapestry as well.      Khruangbin  is the Houston-based trio of Laura Lee, Mark Speer and Donald ""DJ"" Johnson. Lee and Speer got the inspiration to start a band while opening for Bonobo as members of Yppah's touring band. Their name was taken from the Thai word for ""aeroplane,"" and it suits their worldly psychedelic sound. Khruangbin's first three studio albums — 2015's  The Universe Smiles Upon You , 2018's  Con Todo el Mundo  and 2020's  Mordechai  — evoked everything from surf, funk and dub to Spanish, Middle Eastern, Korean, West African and Thai music.  Mordechai  was a top ten charting record in a half-dozen countries, so Khruangbin are literally all over the place.     Originally from Atlanta,  Leon Bridges  subsequently relocated to Fort Worth, and took the world by storm with his 2015 debut  Coming Home . That record's retro-soul was particularly indebted to Sam Cooke, since Cooke appears in almost every piece of text written about it (including this). He opened his R&B style up a bit more with 2018's  Good Thing , hosting hints of funk, disco, pop and hip-hop more in line with Prince and Ginuwine, while 2021's  Gold-Diggers Sound  refined more Afrobeat, jazz and, indeed, country vibes during a series of midnight jam sessions in the wake of the George Floyd protests.     At a similar point in their simultaneous ascensions, Khruangbin and Bridges met while touring for their respective sophomore albums in 2018. Though the paths they walked to get there were markedly different as a classic major label soul singer and a mostly-instrumental cosmic indie band, they quickly bonded over their mutual influences from the Texas music scene. Even though  Texas Moon  is only their second EP, following 2020's  Texas Sun , it sounds like they have been playing together all their lives.     Bridges usually works on big studio albums with a lot of producers, tasked to polish his sound in certain ways. With Khruangbin, he is free to just be, and that's how an unforgettable moment like ""B-Side"" happens. ""B-Side"" was actually one of the first songs they collectively worked on in the same room, and it's far too easy to picture the hazy  Get Back  rehearsal setting as they hummed and noodled toward the song's genesis. Instantly intoxicating, the song feels somewhere between upbeat Jimmy Cliff or laidback Kiki Gyan with its prickly strummed guitar, dubby bassline, simmering drums, punctuating organ, daffy percussion and Bridges' buttery, lovelorn orations.     Up to  Con Todo el Mundo , Khruangbin tended to use vocals as more of a textural element, burying harmonies in the mix. Working with a proper lead vocalist inspired them to be more vocally present on  Mordechai , and you can see hints of that growing confidence even between  Texas Sun  and  Moon . Without sounding overworked, ""Doris"" comes off like Isaac Hayes soul-searching in Muscle Shoals Sound Studio at midnight due to its soulful callback chorus, reverb-drenched wah-wah guitar, sparse drums and deeply impactful lyrics about Bridges' dearly departed grandmother.     Every track on  Texas Moon  is a moment of catharsis, delivered with as much swagger as spirituality. Vibing like a Velvet Underground raga with a dab of ""The End"" by the Doors, ""Father Father"" melds a tripping guitar line, lethargic bass line, and meditative vibrations of what sounds like a calm breeze blowing through a wind chime with a plaintive gospel refrain that reminds a broken man of God's love. They draw from all the people, places and things that inspire them, but Khruangbin and Leon Bridges make Texas music, and it's everything.

2022-02-18,Dylan Barnabe,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Tennyson's 'Rot' Is Fresh,,"There is a certain irony in creating your most dynamic music while suffering a hearing condition. That was the reality for  Tennyson , a.k.a. Luke Pretty, as a hearing condition, caused by mould exposure, threatened to derail his first full-length LP. But instead of decay, the aptly named  Rot  achieves quite the opposite. It radiates growth and maturity from the young Canadian, whose journey down the rabbit hole of ear canal issues yields a cohesive album of pop-laced electronic tracks.    Following the critical acclaim of EPs  Different Water  and  Telescope  in 2019, the Edmonton musician steps out from behind his instrumental production to lend vocals to nearly each track. The result is an immediate sense of intimacy, with ballads like ""Torn"" paring down the glitch in favour of a more direct communion with the listener. You get the sense Tennyson spent a lot of time introspecting, and was forced to carry on and find the inner resolve to push forward with his work.    For being a record that clearly deals with intense internal and external turmoil,  Rot  is surprisingly palatable. No track extends much beyond the 4:30 mark, making for digestible and melody-driven songs. There are moments of levity, such as ""Figure Eights,"" but also meditations on overcoming darker days as heard on ""Doors"". The track's nightmarish mood is underlined by staccato vocals and eerie piano melodies, and also by lyrics that discuss sleepless nights and not being able to ""take it anymore."" In this way,  Rot  is very much Tennyson making sense of his reality — perhaps most succinctly captured on ""Iron,"" as he sings, ""Run the riddle back again / Until I understand,"" or on ""Leaves,"" as he croons, ""It feels like it's all over now / But I carry on."" There is resignation, yes, but also determination.     There's an old adage that ""beauty is pain."" Tennyson certainly suffered pain in creating his debut album, but undoubtedly created beauty as well.  Rot  is an impressive first LP, and no doubt speaks to the young musician's promising future.  ( Counter )                           REVIEWS   ALBUM   DANCE AND ELECTRONIC   MUSIC              More Tennyson",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/tennyson_rot_album_review
2022-02-21,Alisha Mughal,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Hamilton Shoegazers Basement Revolver 'Embody' Vulnerability, Resilience and Growth",,"Embody , the second full-length album by Hamilton, ON, shoegazers  Basement Revolver , is a pandemic baby. Forged against the constraining backdrop of numerous lockdowns, and spurred on by personal journeys of growth and self-reckonings that only isolation could kindle, the sophomore record is a stunning distillation of the band's skill and acumen. More than that, though, this record is an astonishing reminder that the unseen explosions taking place within our roiling minds are as worthy of discussion and attention as are the events of our physical reality, for oftentimes these unseen circumstances are more indelible than tributaries in rock.     Embody  is a stellar record that charts a storm of becoming and unbecoming, making a meal of the delicious paradox of lead singer Chrisy Hurn-Morrison's preternatural voice and lyrics vulnerable as a wound housed within raging guitars and soldiering drums (established in their earlier work, this contrast is masterfully developed here). The album documents earth-shattering personal metamorphoses delicately, like a barometer rising.    The pandemic, with its attendant, periodic ebbing and flowing of restrictions, stalled  Embody 's production, causing for the band's studio time to be desultory in 2020, but the album did eventually emerge. Throughout this protracted production process, the band took on a new drummer, Levi Kertesz, and Hurn-Morrison herself received a diagnosis of bulimia, all while watching her now-former church take a stance against the queer community. On the record, these latter two events become subsumed under larger ideas of faith and feeling at-home in oneself; they are reckoned with throughout  Embody , whose lyrics function in a confiding, boldly diaristic way to communicate Hurn-Morrison's inner world. The kindness and the anger both appear in turn, for they are a part of an identity's continual unfolding.    With its controlled industrial clangor and sleepy bass, opener ""Skin"" sets the tone for the album, that of strength among internal chaos  ""Make me feel small / Don't wanna know at all / The shape of my body,"" Hurn-Morrison sings, her voice cracking as if about to weep by the end of the phrase. But she doesn't weep. ""Eraser lines, just markers of the times / Darling, you stand by,"" she goes on, the timbre of her voice having steadied. A lilting piano carries the chorus. This is a song about working to love one's body, but also about the ways in which its sensations lead to bursts of happiness, proving that it's possible to transmute internal darknesses to stability or even power. There is hope, if you're willing to look for it.     There's a folksier tone to this album as compared to the group's earlier work, best evidenced in the persistent twang of ""Blackhole."" The track begins with sounds of a downpour as a guitar echoing the pluck of a banjo comes in, and then Hurn-Morrison's voice, so much like Dolores O'Riordan's, begins. It's a song about loss. ""I've never loved you more / But damn this hurts / Letting him go / Back to the norm,"" she sings, before falling into its chorus, ""Lose control / I have become a black hole."" Every element, from the rain to the weeping piano to the strings to the lyrics and vocals, is complementary, with the strength of its beauty fighting off any inertia.    There's an unrelenting, unexpected optimism carried through the album as it flickers between thundering guitars on one track to delicate piano on another, following a trajectory similar to the ways in which intrusive thoughts work in the mind. Hurn-Morrison fleshes out the album's themes — search for safety within one's skin, how faith can be reconciled with institutional hatred — by listening to her thoughts, giving them space and showing them respect, an act which carries with it a tremendous amount of strength. The track ""Tired"" is more vibrant than you might expect based off its name. ""Breaking my teeth on the glass that they tried to cut me out of,"" she sings as drums begin a steadily driving beat like a march. ""Tired of living like I'm dying / Tired of being the enemy,"" her voice seems to whisper, as she talks to someone unseen about the persistence of her heart and faith despite the unmasked bigotry of sacred institutions. Here, the song becomes a veritable mess of noise, harkening back to the band's earlier hardcore feel.    Every track on this album uniquely demonstrates that there's strength and validity in vulnerability, in bringing to the surface those thoughts and patterns that have been repeating themselves, festering within for a long while. The album has a keen understanding of the effect of Hurn-Morrison's angelic voice against raging sound, and uses it to good measure on various tracks, especially near the end, where tracks like ""Dissolve"" and ""Tunnel Vision"" gesture toward a sunniness after the downpour.    Indeed, the final track ""Long Way"" is closer to country than any other track. Hurn-Morrison sings of change and growth within herself, despite all the judgment from a mirror, despite all the hardships. She tells herself to turn away from her reflection as she sings of love, overcoming fears, of countenancing one's essence. As she sings of the persistence of a body despite piercing gazes, her voice commingled with the cadence of the chorus is breathtaking. The track's end is like a ghostly adieu to recent difficulties.    More than anything, Basement Revolver lead by example through  Embody , showing listeners that uncertainties and confusions and anger and sadnesses are valid and worth soldiering through. This is an album that haunts as it works through trauma and attempts to wash off its murky shadows, ultimately successfully revealing light and hope for the future.  Embody  is a new and worthwhile turn in Basement Revolver's oeuvre, showcasing band members' musical talents and elevating Hurn-Morrison's poetic songwriting.

2022-02-22,Max Heilman,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Body and OAA's 'Enemy of Love' Is an Amorphous Blob of Hellish Cacophony,,"Through countless jarring shifts, sludge metal duo  the Body  have maintained one constant: collaboration. Even on 2021's supposed return to form  I've Seen All I Need to See ,  drummer Lee Bufford and guitarist/vocalist Chip King couldn't resist bringing other musicians into the fold. They've amassed a small army of like-minded weirdos for making all sorts of music, from  industrial hip-hop with Full of Hell  to  neo-folk with Big Brave . By comparison, joining forces with underground electronic producer  OAA  (aka AJ Wilson) seems almost normal. OAA and the Body's respective affinity for sonic aberration makes  Enemy of Love  a suitably hideous, if straightforward, meeting of minds.    The single ""Barren of Joy"" effectively foreshadows the form  Enemy of Love  takes. Wilson stabs through King's suffocating brown noise with jittery synth arpeggios, as he and Bufford try their best to avoid synchronicity while peppering the wall of sound with chaotic percussive salvos. Rounded out by King's unnerving squawks and additional rasps from recurring guest Ben Eberle of the grind/sludge band Sandworm, the excursion proves as immersive as it is unforgiving. Those who heard either artists' 2021 albums will perceive pleasantly familiar echoes within the muck.    The Body have long revelled in subverting their sludge metal roots, making opener ""Devalued"" a fairly standard affair — in spite of its grating feedback layers, primitive drum loops and filthy guitar strains. Blown-out drums and nasty distortion notwithstanding, the song actually shares a healthy respect for quiet with the following ""Pseudocyesis."" Both cuts feature moments of near silence before the mayhem returns with full force, due in part to Wilson acting as both embellisher and leader of the disorienting pandemonium. He intuitively guides the song through transient post-industrial, before contentedly fading into a noise-metal beatdown.     Enemy of Love 's seamless integration of alien electronics and sludge metal boils down to its impenetrable production value. Distinguishing King's demonic goat brays from shrill synth blasts at the end of ""Conspiracy Privilege"" becomes a challenge, and that's a good thing. The album progresses like an amorphous, malleable blob of hellish cacophony, opening the door for ""Hired Regard"" to feed witch house vibes through a McDonald's drive-through speaker. The mutated dance number would be an album standout, if it didn't stop after just over a minute.    Indeed, certain passages from this album come and go before getting a chance to develop. The Body aren't known for complex guitar work, but it's hard to ignore the fact  Enemy of Love  averages at two chords per song. Deeper cuts like ""Ignorant Messiah"" and ""Miserable Freedom"" suffer from this lack of variety, mainly because they don't provide a lot to focus on beyond the monotonous drones and bombshell drums.    The album's highest points centre on OAA warping the Body's sonic signature, like the mutated techno of ""Fortified Tower"" or the multi-layered beats that drive ""Obsessed Luxury."" Chord variation stops mattering when guitar becomes the foundation for the former cut's propulsive, eerie textures or the latter's dirge-like electro-acoustic clamor. In this way, the rattling hi-hats and grimy samples of ""Docile Gift"" close the record with a solid display of OAA's off-the-wall approach augmenting the Body's sonic torment. Wilson even seems to sample King's screams, but who can tell when the sum of the song's parts amounts to a junkyard explosion?    It's a shame Wilson missed out on some chances to throw these arrangements down a deeper rabbit hole, but  Enemy of Love  still comes through with compelling facets of two powerful veins of anti-music. It might not branch off as drastically as the Body's other collaborations, but the album remains a distinct iteration of the band's truly strange voice in underground music.

2022-02-23,Chris Bryson,7,"AMBIENT,METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Blood Incantation Space Out on 'Timewave Zero',,"On their first two full-lengths,  Blood Incantation  crafted cosmic death metal that launched them to the exosphere. Their journey — on the fringes of metal, tethered between death and beyond — was given extra thrust by the success of 2019's  Hidden History of the Human Race ,  which earned major accolades and marked them as an act to watch. For their new record,  Timewave Zero , the Denver quartet departed on a decidedly different musical trajectory, dropping the metal of yore to explore the vastness and zero gravity of outer space.     The intent was to lean into the experimental, psychedelic and progressive elements of their music while exploring their dark, cosmic and cinematic tendencies even further, and  Timewave Zero  is a sprawling galactic odyssey. The LP unfolds across two near twenty-minute tracks, scanning serenity to requiem and the gulfs in between.     A pulse draws the listener into song one, ""Io."" It builds gradually until a massive drone appears with faint metallic squeaks. Then, it intensifies, with layers of rippling tones and mysterious clatter. It's distinctly sci-fi. Notes bubble, stretch and are cast into the ether. Sound signals emit into shimmering nothingness. Around the eight-minute mark, a synth starts flowing through a recurring motif shrouded in dark, swelling ambience as silvery ribbons float like shooting stars in the distance. As that motif falls away, the immenseness returns, and with it a groaning drone and guitar that grow to be funereal, foreboding and hypnotic. By the time the sequence transitions into the song's rumbling, softly twanging coda, the listener is lost far in Blood Incantation's orbit.     ""Ea"" picks up in similar territory. Synths send arpeggiating pulses and beams of light into humming, twinkling space. The piece evolves slowly and subtly, always staying within a moderate scope which, for these excursions' expansiveness, somewhat limits their allure. Nevertheless,  Timewave Zero  is a scenic and mournful drift through cold and emotive cosmos. Around the midpoint of ""Ea,"" an elegiac and haunting guitar riff makes a distinct appearance, joined by sparkling squelches, brooding bass and subdued wails. The track continues as this refrain dissolves into forlorn bellows and ebbing rays, moving further into the deep, dark unknown.     Blood Incantation's shift into ambience is an admirable one, especially following an effort as lauded as  Hidden History of the Human Race . While  Timewave Zero  finds the band adapting well to this shadowy fantasia, one can't help but feel now that Blood Incantation has set the lay of the galaxy, there is more to explore. Whether the results are visceral or cerebral, of inner consciousness or outer space, these guys are well-equipped for the ride.

2022-02-23,Vish Khanna,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Superchunk Wage War Against 'Wild Loneliness' with Infectious Sweetness,,"In all the grimy gloom of a pandemic, we need  Superchunk  to drop by and blast it all away with a wondrously upbeat and slyly optimistic record that shows off their spirited sophistication, as one of the best pop-rock bands (still) going. Augmented with horns, including Kelly Pratt on trumpet and Wye Oak's Andy Stack on saxophone, and strings helmed by Owen Pallett,  Wild Loneliness  wars against despair, armed to the teeth with infectious sweetness.     With songs written before and during the pandemic,  Wild Loneliness  bears the distinction of being eerily prescient and emotionally reactive to whatever raw uncertainty all of us were enduring on many — if not most — days between 2020 and now. The tension of ""City of the Dead,"" which feels borne of our various pandemic-induced pauses, lies in its sense that there is something looming from the second it begins and then continues to build, as Mac McCaughan phrases his vocals haltingly, leaving us hanging after each thoughtful stanza, and singing of a haunted normalcy most of us are still negotiating each day.     ""Endless Summer"" might be of the same time and crisis, but it's not. Here, the band take on climate change with one of the most artful pop anthems in a Superchunk catalogue that already contains several storage units full of such things. Backed up by Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake and Raymond McGinley on vocals, this song's legitimately and viscerally refreshing; it's so propulsive a call to action, it generates true hope that something can be done about global warming and ecological collapse — and it's only a catchy-ass song, really.     There are occasions on tracks like, say, ""Highly Suspect,"" where the horns blare and Jon Wurster adds a hiccup to his kick pattern, that find Superchunk at their most fearless. Familiar textural flourishes and a blend of distortion and acoustic guitars will certainly soothe old faithfuls, but there are some surprises too, like McCaughan's gorgeous vocal turn on ""Set It Aside"" — his vocal command has never sounded so rich. His sense of purpose and reassurance on ""On the Floor,"" a huge pop song featuring the sturdy lock-step of bassist Laura Ballance and rhythm guitarist Jim Wilbur, plus back-up vocals by Mike Mills of R.E.M., gives McCaughan the air of a coach rallying his team at halftime, and it's enough to make you think that against all odds, we're all gonna win this thing.    When ""This Night,"" accompanied by Pallett's strings, comes crashing forth, it feels like the kind of sound Bruce Springsteen has been chasing on his most recent contemporary E Street Band records. More than anything else,  Wild Loneliness  recalls Springsteen's post 9/11 return,  The Rising , in that the vibe suggests an intermingling of songs conceived before and after something monumental and life-changing occurred, and yet the ideas co-exist in a landscape where the temporal confusion doesn't preclude the sharing of strange experiences.     The world was hard and shitty before the pandemic and then it got still, and we had time to think about what we were all doing to each other. Some of that reflection brought us together; a lot of it tore us apart. There are moments on Superchunk's inspired and inspiring  Wild Loneliness  where ideas of isolation and connection are pondered and addressed but any despondency is met with righteous hope and a roaring conviction that all is not lost, and goddamn do we need records like these right now.

2022-02-24,Adam Feibel,9,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Gang of Youths' 'angel in realtime' Revels in Relentless Optimism,,"Music about the death of a loved one doesn't usually sound this joyous.    Listen to some of the most acclaimed indie rock records about loss and grief from the last few years — Mount Eerie's  A Crow Looked at Me,  Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds'  Ghosteen,  Sufjan Stevens'  Carrie & Lowell  — and you're in for beautifully devastating meditations on what it means to lose a person you love. That's not the case with  Gang of Youths '  a ngel in realtime . The Australian rock band's third album revolves around singer David Le'aupepe making sense of his life after the death of his father, Teleso ""Tattersall"" Le'aupepe. What unfolds is a captivating story that spans continents, cultures and generations as a son unlocks the mysteries of his father's life and finds answers — and inner peace — in his family tree. Far from mournful,  angel in realtime  is an inspiring, uplifting record that's full of voices, laughter and stories.    This is to be expected from Gang of Youths. Le'aupepe's default response to his personal history of struggle and adversity — a wife with cancer, a divorce, a suicide attempt — has been to channel it into rousing, arena-ready rock 'n' roll music that encourages you to shout and pump your fist over the joy of existence. The band's determined 2015 debut  The Positions  and magnificent 2017 follow-up  Go Farther in Lightness   established them as one of the most impassioned, life-affirming rock bands out there today. Basically, Gang of Youths approach their music as if exercising every fibre of hope, passion and resilience could be potentially life-saving, and that falling short of that standard ought to be considered a cataclysmic failure — and they do so with such sincerity that it's been met with plenty of skepticism (leading one critic to wonder if they're "" too earnest for America "").    Gang of Youths know this. So while  angel in realtime  glows with the same emotional intensity and utmost sincerity, it does cut the "" bogus, rock-y shit "" (Le'aupepe's words) of the band's previous releases. They've replaced it with richer storytelling and an eclectic sound that takes inspiration from contemporary classical, Britpop and drum n' bass, along with contributions from the Auckland Gospel Choir and numerous recordings of choirs from Polynesia and the South Pacific islands (some new and others from the archives of English composer David Fanshawe). Here, the almighty guitar stands down to make way for percussive elements, traditional Indigenous music and even more string arrangements with the addition of violinist and keyboardist Tom Hobden. Together, it makes for a hugely orchestral, euphoric modern rock record that's imbued with the sounds of Le'aupepe and his family's heritage and identity.    The band begins by honouring the memory of Le'aupepe's late father on ""you in everything,"" a beautifully written opener that introduces the record's symphonic, cinematic sound. With unmistakable warmth and emotion in his voice, Le'aupepe goes on to contemplate the reality of moving on without his father's guiding light in his life, all while discovering the things that Tattersall kept hidden — including a previous family back in his home of Samoa — and forming a life-changing connection with his ancestral homeland. The band moves through big, anthemic songs like the bright and sunny ""in the wake of your leave,"" the War on Drugs-esque synth rock of ""the angel of 8th ave.,"" and the soaring melodies of ""the man himself,"" as Le'aupepe moves through the stages of grieving with a mixture of fear, regret and determination.    This relentless optimism persists throughout the album, and there are so many other layers that make  angel in realtime  such a rich and rewarding musical pursuit .  Le'aupepe's sense of humour comes through most loudly on the celebratory-sounding ""returner,"" a song that both sarcastically and self-reflectively questions the role of an artist in a capitalist system. ""the kingdom is within you"" takes the Britpop stylings of Oasis and the Verve and reimagines them with UK garage grooves as Le'aupepe evokes the struggles of Pasifika migrants. ""tend the garden"" fuses psychedelic folk, drum 'n' bass and chillwave as Le'aupepe does his best to piece together his father's decisions and regrets from his fraught history. The centrepiece of that story is ""brothers,"" a loving, tender piano ballad that tells the tale of Tattersall's long-kept secrets and his children's discovery and forgiveness. All of it culminates in an arresting two-part finale named for the athletic triumphs of Diego Maradona; by the time the curtain closes on ""goal of the century,"" there's a good chance it'll bring a tear to your eye.    Musically, lyrically and thematically, there's  so much  packed into this record, yet it doesn't feel overstuffed.  angel in realtime  is full of emotional complexity, cultural exploration and ancestral connection, complete with Le'aupepe's Aussie sense of humour and barbs of sociopolitical commentary. Ultimately, it's a monument to the love that's shared between an adoring parent and their child, and the imprint of that love which endures for a lifetime.    In all of its grandiose storytelling,  angel in realtime  remains just a small step away from a musical theatre production. The characters and settings are written in vivid detail, the narrative is expertly crafted with flashes between past and present, and the music feels predestined for the drama and showmanship of a theatrical stage. Gang of Youths wouldn't dare call it a ""rock opera,"" but it basically is — and a great one, too. Without changing the fundamental spirit that has made them such recognizable (though underappreciated) figures in rock music, they've burst out of the confines of ""rock"" to make something that's legitimately transcendent.  a ngel in realtime  is a profoundly beautiful, meaningful album from a band that has decided that every record might as well be a new magnum opus.

2022-02-24,Louis Pavlakos,6,"HIP-HOP,R&B,SOUL & FUNK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Big K.R.I.T.'s Blossoming Soul Has Thorns on 'Digital Roses Don't Die',,"To date,  Big K.R.I.T.  has been a dependable, if not predictable rapper whose appeals remained evident across his albums and mixtapes. His last album,  K.R.I.T. IZ HERE , didn't exactly reinvent his sound, but it also wasn't an offensively bad release. Enter  Digital Roses Don't Die : the Mississippi artist's attempt at making a neo-soul album, largely abandoning the soundscapes that once defined him.     Gone are the trunk-rattling beats that defined early mixtapes like  Return of 4Eva . Instead, K.R.I.T. dedicates  Digital Roses Don't Die  to love and the shock of ending up with someone who didn't share the same upbringing that he did. ""Southside of the Moon"" chronicles his falling in love with someone born in New York and living in Los Angeles. It's not particularly detailed on his part, barely cracking the two-minute mark, but K.R.I.T. uses the brevity to emphasize that the woman in question is the real focus: ""I ain't mad at 'em if they ain't recognize my face / I still smile in this mansion, thuggin' cause I get around / All eyes on you when you in town.""     If nothing else,  Digital Roses Don't Die  is the most heartfelt K.R.I.T. has been since 2017 double album  4eva Is A Mighty Long Time . Though the tracks don't always delve deep into the rapper's psyche, there are moments of true self-reflection. ""Generational - Weighed Down"" sees K.R.I.T. reflect on his insecurities, expressing concern over being a parent and developing addictive habits: ""What if I ain't meant to be a parent? / What if I'm a lost soul damaged? / What if I can't slow down the throttle? / What if I can't put down the bottle?"" Further reflection is found in songs like ""It's Over Now"" and ""Would It Matter?,"" but fail to add more depth to the artist's ethos.     While more conceptual than his previous album,  Digital Roses Don't Die  suffers from a minor identity crisis. Four interludes, named for the four classical elements of nature, none of them seem to separate the feelings of the album. ""Fire (Interlude)"" is supposed to act as a fiery opener about passion, but fails to set the tone of the next four tracks until the next interlude. Their inclusion feels more like a forced concept than a distinct separation of the album's varying moods.     Despite ditching the southern rap tropes in his aesthetic switch, Big K.R.I.T.'s efforts to make a neo-soul album mostly work. He has a lovely singing voice and an excellent ear for beats, but doesn't always hit the mark. Lacking the depth of his more memorable efforts,  Digital Roses Don't Die  sounds more like an album Big K.R.I.T. made for himself rather than something he expected his fans to collectively laud.

2022-02-25,Luke Fox,8,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",'God Don't Make Mistakes' When It Comes to Conway the Machine's Captivating Voice,,"The first guest voice you hear on  God Don't Make Mistakes,   Conway the Machine 's long-awaited major label debut, speaks volumes about where the rapper is coming from — and the lane he's striving to plow through. A raspy  Beanie Sigel  barks through the gloomy drugs-and-guns opener ""Lock Load."" The Broad Street Bully famously gave  JAY-Z 's Roc-A-Fella empire even more street cred. Since his wild heyday, Beanie's voice has changed. Wounded in a 2014 drive-by shooting, Sigel was rushed to the hospital. A removed lung left his voice hindered.     Conway, too, has had health struggles affect his rap flow. Shot in the neck and shoulder in 2012, the bullets left him with Bell's Palsy that paralyzed the right side of his face, sending him into mental spiral. So, when Conway (or Sigel, for that matter) dives into the unseemly traps of street life – greed, paranoia, violence, desperation, self-reliance – the listener isn't questioning bona fides. A blurted threat like, ""I'm losing my marbles / Lettin' my AR go,"" carries weight because you can envision the man snapping for real.     What's great about Conway — and what's splattered all over his decidedly non-commercial commercial debut   — is that the corner boasts come parcelled with introspection, regret and growth. The 39-year-old  Griselda Records  star has moved past his past, and yet, will forever be highly informed by the Buffalo, NY, struggle that shaped him.     Although  GDMM 's guest list sounds expensive ( Lil Wayne ,  Rick Ross ,  T.I. ,  Jill Scott ) and the production credits are A-plus ( t he Alchemist , Daringer,  J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League ,  Hit-Boy , Bink!, Cosmo),  Conway's choice in beats hasn't wavered one iota since his mixtape days. Dark and brooding, this is a record built for a brutal winter in Upstate New York; for dudes who can't afford AirPods, but are rocking a hand-me-down bubblegoose while trudging along a snowy sidewalk.     Conway shares mic time with his old mates,  Benny the Butcher  and  Westside Gunn , on the gloriously grimy ""John Woo Flick,"" and his own proteges,  Jae Skeese and 7xve, on ""Drumwork."" Despite his eagerness to be inclusive, the marquee artist's persona hogs this set.    Credit Conway for cranking out a smartly written collection of street rap and not stretching too far out of his zone just because he's now on  Eminem 's label. In other words,  God Don't Make Mistakes  avoids the mistakes some of Slim Shady's other find-and-signs have fallen victim to. That's due to an ear for dope beats in his wheelhouse and a willingness to, occasionally, get thug emo. To sometimes ignore the advice of an OG (""Keep those feelings in your chest / Just kill 'em with your success"") and let us in to a pain that can resort to inflicting it.     Whether getting confessional about his come-up (""Wild Chapter""), wrestling with relationships (""Piano Love""), recounting his near-death experience with rawness (""Guilty""), or flat-out admitting to depression, alcoholism and familial suicide (""Stressed"") Conway's voice bleeds throughout this star-studded affair — damaged as it is.

2022-02-28,Luke Fox,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,HIP-HOP,MUSIC",EarthGang Commune with Ghosts and Greatness on 'Ghetto Gods',,"Ghosts can, at once, haunt and inspire; they can loom tragic and stir ideas.      EarthGang 's brilliant if uneven  Ghetto Gods  is heavily linked to the open-minded duo's heroes, most of whom have passed yet swirl wholly present for Olu and WowGr8's deep mediations and flighty escapes.    So, when guest emcee and fellow Dreamville threat JID hops on the bouncy posse cut ""Waterboyz"" and spits, ""I see the evil is in disguise / All of my idols already died,"" you have to wonder if he heard his pals' entire album and was summing it up in one hot line.    EarthGang continually strive to ground the heavenly to the earthly, and vice versa. There are mentions of attacking life with a ""Mamba mentality"" (in reference to Kobe Bryant), binging on Nipsey Hussle verses, and rocking boats like Aaliyah.     Bittersweet single ""All Eyes on Me"" is, fittingly, precisely the type of chest-pounding, semi-spiritual anthem Tupac Shakur would make if he were still alive and raging against today's machine. The bud-burning break ""Smoke Sum"" was lit as a coping strategy during their home city's George Floyd protests, and it simmers with high-test Bob Marley vibes. (Heck, even promo single ""Aretha"" — not included in the studio's finished product, sadly — is a sweet ode to Ms. Franklin.)    ""Warriors die, but they live in the sky,"" WowGr8 raps at one point, grasping skyward from Atlanta, GA.    Spiritual overtones and seeds of legacy drape the proceedings on  Ghetto Gods , which wants its listener to shed the lies and fakery, to let their inner light shine. Of course, its authors' writing is too smart and their skills too dexterous to allow this message to come off as corny. The risk-taking production, overseen by Kawan ""KP"" Prather of Dungeon Family, leans into their home state's swamp-thick hip-hop history.    The four-song run of ""Waterboyz,"" ""Amen,"" ""All Eyes on Me"" and ""Lie to Me"" — a moral story rap so soaked in P-funk, I waited for George Clinton to pop up and talk smack about a mothership or electo-booties or something — is as clean and fun as anything in EarthGang's catalogue.     Then we're given some superb if sombre conceptual pieces. ""American Horror Story"" picks at the United States' original sin (sample lyric: ""There goes the neighbourhood / Now they comin' back to take the hood""). And ""Power"" drags Goodie Mob's sing-happy  Cee-Lo Green  back into the rap game.    Still, despite these thunderclaps of clarity, the project's entirety lacks some of the explosive world-building that energized its predecessor, 2019's  Mirrorland . The five skippable skits and a sleepy conclusion bog down the second half of a record that sort of coasts to the finish line. And some of the cameos ( 2 Chainz ,  Future ,  Nick Cannon ) don't add much beyond brand-name cachet.    Whereas  Mirrorland  came from a comparatively calm moment in history,  Ghetto Gods  was created through a plague and a racial reckoning. So, it's understandable that the fun factor and the tempo have been dialled down. Heavy is the pen.    Still, when those heroic ghosts and EarthGang pop in synchronicity, the music is downright out of this world.

2022-02-03,Michael Di Gennaro,8,"HIP-HOP,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Saba Exhibits Musical Passion and Progress on 'Few Good Things',,"Saba 's clear love for rapping, and rap music in general, is felt in his therapeutic, diaristic writing. 2018's  Care For Me  was filled with brutally honest moments in which Saba admitted to being overwhelmed with his own life, distraught with grief after the passing of his cousin, fellow Pivot Gang member John Walt. It's a heartbreaking debut that introduced one of the most impressive MCs of his generation to the world, and made listeners deeply invested in his life and his art.     Those themes of stress and uncertainty carry over to  Few Good Things , but in a different context. The record picks up following the acclaim of  Care For Me , and Saba is now successful and rich, but no closer to feeling the security and comfort that status should bring. Instead, he only has more things to worry about: does he deserve to escape the violence of Chicago's South side more than anyone else that grew up there? How can he ensure he won't end up broke again? What will happen to his relationships with family, friends, and lovers? How can he balance the things he appreciated about his old life — even if he didn't appreciate them at the time — with the perks of his newfound success?     The first half of the album is spent almost exclusively asking these questions. On ""One Way or Every N**** With A Budget"", Saba shares all the new things he's been able to do and buy since making his name in music, while also expressing a subtle worry about how much he's been spending. ""Survivor's Guilt"" has a similarly braggadocious tone, but simultaneously hints at the conflicting feelings of leaving the environment that made him while the people he grew up around continue to live in poverty and danger. These ideas are best summed up in a single line: ""What's really eating when you're from a food desert?"" It's only fitting that G Herbo, perhaps the best rapper alive when it comes to chronicling sobering realities of gang life, is a guest.       Beyond money, the relationships that Saba has fostered have clearly changed since he blew up, and much of the album's middle portion deals with the rifts his new life has created between him and the people he loves. He reasons with his woman on the Smino and 6LACK-assisted ""Still,"" and on ""Soldier,"" uses war as a metaphor for the fear of bringing new life into the world. The proverbial ""soldier"" in the song could represent a number of things: protecting his child and their mother from the harshness of the world, going on tour and leaving his family behind, or even battling with his own psyche in order to be strong and stable for his kid. Throughout all of these songs, there's an underlying feeling that despite his success, Saba may wish that he could go back to before he was Saba; before his cousin passed, before rapping was a career, when life's responsibilities were little more than showing up to homeroom on time.     Despite all of the paranoia that runs through  Few Good Things , the second half of the album reveals it to have a generally happy ending, transforming into a coming-of-age story for a kid whose environment never gave him the chance to truly grow up. The album's back half takes a far more confident, positive outlook on the changes that have occurred in Saba's life, one in which he believes that he does deserve what he's worked so hard for. He's no longer wishing he had his fallen friends back; he's accepting that they have passed, and knows they're smiling down on him. He's finding balance between the connections he had in his old life, and the ones he's making in his newest chapter.     The contrast in philosophies is best shown in the difference between ""Simpler Time"" and penultimate track ""2012."" Where the former finds Saba longing to go back in time to his teen years, his raps on ""2012"" signal that he knows that part of his life is gone, and while he appreciates it and looks back fondly, he's no longer clinging onto it. Though  Few Good Things  is intensely personal, Saba understands that he's not the only person to have ever felt these things, and he communicates his own experiences in a way that invites the listener to share in the emotions that come with them, only making the album more potent.     While the stories told within  Few Good Things  are definitely the focal point of the record, the musicianship that accompanies it matches and at times even exceeds it. Saba appreciates what the music does for him, and he respects it by putting in the amount of work that it deserves. Instrumentals range from soulful maximalism to brute minimalism, while his rapping is as tight as ever, finding precise pockets and balancing old-school rhyme schemes with palatable, new-school flows that allow him to sound smoother over modern production than some of his more lyrically-focused counterparts. It's a combination of the best qualities of the Chicago legends Saba grew up listening to, injected with his own personality and unique, poetic writing.

When they lean into it, they make their best music, too.  Follow the Leader,  from 1998, is a blueprint for the brooding if volatile melange the band began with, while 2018's  The Nothing   was an honest, heavy expression of despondence and grief. Frontman  Jonathan Davis 's wife and mother both passed away before recording that last outing, and his reflection on them remains a focal point of Korn's latest record,  Requiem .    Early singles ""Start the Healing"" and ""Forgotten"" lean into swampy guitars and swap between gentler and harsher vocals — well-trodden territory for Korn, but it's done well, and the reported analog recording process has yielded some of the best-sounding guitars of their career. ""My Confession"" is an absolute barn-burner for fans of detuned, wild headbanging riffs.    Along with well-executed expressions of grief,  Requiem  also leans into some of the band's bad habits. We hear over-produced, heavily overdubbed vocals on almost every chorus, and some half-hearted attempts at big synth hooks. It's hard to swallow the tonal shifts from verse to chorus on this record, and it ends up threatening to sink  Requiem  entirely.    They do, however, save the best for last on closer ""Worst Is on Its Way,"" which includes acoustic guitar, Davis' trademark metal scatting, and some thoughtful keyboards. While the vocals here are easily the best from Davis on the album, regrettably, the lonely bagpipes and sparse arrangements that made Korn's last record so unexpectedly powerful don't show up to save the day.    Maybe it's Korn's penchant for being as heavy and distorted as possible, but the sonic sameness of the record really puts it in stark contrast with their most recent work. Davis seems to bring his best at his most damaged and unhinged, and it's a shame that his band's unrelenting use of pummelling palm-muted guitar leaves him little room for nuance. Guitarist James ""Munky"" Shaffer may have revolutionized the use of detuned, seven-string guitars, but it's the unwillingness to innovate and be dynamic that holds  Requiem  back from being a real impactful journey.    For fans of nu metal and heavy riffs,  Requiem  will not disappoint, but it lacks the sadness that Korn have long tapped into to differentiate themselves from the pack.

The band's imperial phase — that untouchable period where it seems impossible for an artist to make a wrong move, creating music that feels unreasonable, unattainable — started more or less when they did; their robes a rotating jamboree of hole-riddled overalls and repurposed fishing gear, furs and silks disguised as billowing T-shirts.    And now, as is customary of any good imperial phase (and sometimes a harbinger of its end), we get Big Thief's Big Album. The band's releases have previously come in loose pairs — 2017 breakthrough  Capacity  was recorded just seven months after 2016's  Masterpiece , while 2019's one-two punch of sister records  U.F.O.F.  and  Two Hands  cemented the band as a messianic indie tentpole (a pattern furthered by vocalist  Adrianne Lenker 's twin 2020 albums,  songs  and  instrumentals ).  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You , then, feels a bit like Big Thief stitching a would-be pair of beasts into one two-headed calf — or, more accurately, a four-headed calf, the stars above the pasture quadrupled.    The record's 20 songs were captured at four different studios in four different states, each session buffing out a particular facet of the band's jagged little diamond. It's an intriguing premise and a smart way of circumventing Big Album fatigue. And besides, being a Big Thief fan has always meant being a fan of several imagined bands at once, their ""best"" version a constant debate. Do you prefer the quieter, gentler thief? The one that blows the windows out on ""Not""? The slippery celestial invader? Do you miss when Lenker's writing felt more personal and small, or do you thrill when she pulls the universe in?  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You  renders the discrepancies moot. It gathers those myriad faces around the same campfire, the flame a kaleidoscope of colour.    The record is immaculately sequenced, erupting and shrinking precisely when it should for the duration of its 81 minutes. Its spaghetti-at-the-wall approach never feels overwrought or precious, and the initial sonic whiplash of a sequence like ""Change"" to ""Time Escaping"" to ""Spud Infinity"" starts to feel as natural as high-summer weather — patient blues to sun showers, hollow winds to sickly green stormfronts, drunken smoky dusk to balmy black, all in the span of an afternoon. Much like Joanna Newsom's 2010 behemoth  Have One On Me , part of the album's appeal lies in its success as a piece of architecture; an edifice at constant risk of collapsing under its own weight is rendered airborne by a careful and loving curatorial ear.    Drummer  James Krivchenia 's production — aided by contributions from Shawn Everett, Sam Evian, Sam Owens, Dom Monks and a handful of additional players — is as adaptable and dexterous as the music being played, dewy and spectral one moment and dry and stripped the next. Lenker, Krivchenia, bassist Max Oleartchik and guitarist  Buck Meek  (who gets his second Big Thief co-writing credit on ""Certainty"") sound like one spirit, more organism than band.    Crucially, the wildly disparate songs on  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You  feel in conversation rather than competition, linked by the band's near-mythic symbiosis and Lenker's durable writing. Her songs are stretched, knotted and vaporized across the record, buried in instrumentation and effects on ""Time Escaping"" and ""Flower of Blood"" only to be dusted clean, naked as the day on the spellbinding ""The Only Place"" or ""Promise Is a Pendulum."" The band descend into murky trip-hop on the slithering ""Blurred View"" — Oleartchik's fretless bass warping the song's low-end like a torch to plastic — while ""Wake Me Up to Drive"" piles an erratic drum machine and silvery accordion into a piece of rickety, Lightning Dust-adjacent indie pop.      Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You  also marks the official coming-out party for Big Thief the honky-tonk bar band, a new permutation of the group that offers, if you had to choose just one, the record's defining sound. Though they play only about one quarter of the material, the band's country-fried alter-ego is the album's north star; their shaggy songs, accented by Lenker's slightly exaggerated twang, are positioned as guide posts at the record's beginning, middle and end. That subtle structural detail allows the band to range about between the straw-bed rest stops, the barn door swinging open whenever it's time to mosey back home.    These country-indebted songs also make crucial grounding spots for Lenker's writing, their energetic, meat-and-potatoes performance bringing out a warm-hearted simplicity — save for the slapstick delirium of ""Spud Infinity"" — in her lyrics. As Big Thief have grown, so has Lenker's tendency toward abstraction and mysticism, the fantastical spiral of a song like  Capacity 's ""Mary"" becoming the norm rather than the outlier. And while it's a pleasure to hear a songwriter carve out the hieroglyphs of their own peculiar language, the shift from more obviously personal narratives sometimes creates a shade of distance, floating Lenker a few inches above the dirt where she once dug so fiercely.      However, even when she's chasing visions — ""Once again, empty horses / Gallop through the violet door / Follow red, crooked courses / Shadows on the moonlit floor / Oh my stars, winged creatures / Gathering in silken height,"" she sings on the crystalline ""Simulation Swarm"" — there is an unshakeable sense of purpose, a steadfast belief that there's worth in attempting to communicate the incommunicable. How do you say something that's never been said before? You start from scratch.     These subconscious dispatches are an integral part of the band's always-mutating DNA, but Lenker's most affecting songs are often those sung to a human (or even animal) rather than the cosmos. When she sings ""I see you in the yard, drinking a beer / Leaving me undressed like some cheap classic movie / Maybe I'm a little obsessed / Maybe you do use me"" on ""Little Things,"" you'll swear you can feel a bruise blooming on your heart; the humiliation and small grace that comes of loving someone too plainly. And when she warbles, on the fingerpicked ""The Only Place,"" ""When all material scatters / And ashes amplify / The only place that matters / Is by your side,"" you'll be amazed no one had strung those words together so perfectly before.    That  Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You 's vast ecosystem can support this multitude of sounds and voices is astonishing. Even more so is the way its greens seem to become greener — its skies more full of stars, its waters clearer  — the more time you spend with it. It's a universe all its own, clarified a bit more with every listen. As Lenker sings on the title track, over a constellation of guitars and wind chimes, ""it's a little bit magic.""

2022-02-08,Chris Bubinas,9,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Voivod Are as Imaginative and Intricate as Ever on 'Synchro Anarchy',,"After 40 years and over a dozen studio albums worth of acclaimed music, most any band could be excused for mailing it in a bit at this stage of their career. Canadian, terrestrial, and intergalactic prog metal legends  Voivod  elect to flex and soar instead, delivering an impressively intricate and delightful effort with their fifteenth studio work,  Synchro Anarchy .    Thematic juxtaposition and contrast provide an underpinning throughout an album that is as relentless as the rhythmic underbelly provided by the captivating drumming of Michel ""Away"" Langevin and riveting bass work of Dominic ""Rocky"" Laroche. Abstract themes of fracturing dimensions, disintegrating realities, tech-fuelled escapism and assimilation, and personal jubilance decaying into cosmic dust are some of the many different angles that listeners may take away from the album.    In this swirling maelstrom of abstract lyrics and instrumental throwdowns, the interpretive opportunities feel as sprawling and expansive as the universe itself.  Synchro Anarchy  is a piece of art that may invoke a different meaning and emotional journey for any individual listener. As any excellent prog album does, it also provides an experience that ducks and pivots in the dimension of time, seeming to palpitate, gasp, and morph its essence across dozens or hundreds of listens, offering near endless rewards.    The opening track ""Paranormalium"" sets the tone, and within the first ten seconds makes it abundantly clear to fans that this is a Voivod album. Lumbering, gargantuan rhythmic punches are attacked by careening guitar riffs before the music evolves into a spacey symphony of impressive instrumental work and distinctive vocals. The track ""Planet Eaters"" is a groovier affair in many respects, resonating to those who have endured the past two years of our planetary plague: ""We all need to spend some time away, from Earth.""    Where Voivod shine brightest on  Synchro Anarchy  is on the album's title track. Arguably the most impressive track of their career to this point, it's an immediately catchy and ferocious piece of musicianship where every member elevates themselves in majestic unison. Here, the work of guitarist Daniel ""Chewy"" Mongrain (as is evident across the entirety of the album) is absolutely jaw-dropping, and helps to paint an interstellar soundscape in which technology and nature are blurred to the point where the listener may have problems discerning whether sounds may be whale song, or a blaring alien klaxon. Denis ""Snake"" Bélanger anchors the instrumental intensity with his distinctive and well suited layer of vocals. Very rarely does prog metal see a track like this that so perfectly produced, so consummate and complex, all while being such an unadulterated joyride.     Synchro Anarchy  offers sonic and thematic nods to the entire spectrum of Voivod's best, previous work and it does so in an imaginative and uncompromising manner. The work is razor sharp, creating a cosmic sounding tempest of tempo shifts and time signature changes that are pouring with intricacy. Perhaps the best compliment that this album could receive is that every spacey second sounds exactly like Voivod.

2022-02-09,Rachel Kelly,9,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Shamir's 'Heterosexuality' Is Unapologetic,,"For  Shamir 's eighth studio album,  Heterosexuality , the Philadelphia artist directly addresses his queerness for the first time by embracing the most expansive definition of the term — no labels, all bite. If queer acceptance has hit the mainstream,  Heterosexuality  is the leather bar Pride afterparty the straight allies are too scared to attend. In both message and genre, Shamir actively defies categorization, yet he still manages to bare his soul in visceral detail.     Blown-out percussion and guitar à la Nine Inch Nails give the album's overall sound a sense of urgency, as if it were insisting that it must be blasted at top volume. This fiery bedrock supports every track, from humming strings to sparkly synths to cacophonous layers of white noise. Shamir's vocals are otherworldly, careening over the darkness of his tracks before plunging into seduction, despair or both, only to ultimately emerge as an '80s pop falsetto. Somehow, Shamir can invoke Bjork, Prince and the Weeknd, sometimes all in the same track, while still sounding completely unique. The effect is chaotic control; he knows exactly what he wants to say, and he will make sure it is heard.    The 10-track album forms an almost perfect narrative loop. The beginning tracks of the album focus on aggressive nonconformity as a political statement right from the jump; titles like ""Gay Agenda"" and ""Cisgender"" make clear exactly what kind of conversation is being had, and communicate it through an impenetrable wall of sound. They sound like the rallying cry grown out of a life spent demanding the right to exist. With ""Stability,"" Shamir begins to falter, expressing the individual toll of such a fight. He digs deep and unearths traumas, both universal ones and his own unique struggles. On ""Cold Brew"", he sings ""When I'm trying to sleep, my trauma visits me / And reminds me it's all that I've got,"" a succinct explanation of the sense of futility that pervades much of his lyrics.    The latter half of the album moves into a false, saccharine golden hour, the musical equivalent of posting a picture of an idyllic sunset on social media while crying. The tracks are Shamir's version of sweet and sparkly, but the lyrics find helplessness hardening into nihilism. On the last two tracks, Shamir entertains the slightest possibility of hope, the future barely glowing with the seduction that something might actually be better. On ""Reproductive,"" he resigns himself a little, singing, ""Things that give us life makes us question if we can take it anymore / But we put up anyway."" And just like that, life might almost be worth living again, and the fight from the beginning of the album gets taken up once again.    Shamir is economical with this album — not a bar or lyric is wasted, every moment is carefully curated to hit exactly where it needs to. This precision is why the album works so beautifully.  Heterosexuality  captivates and transports the listener, making an ethereal landscape out of dissonance and nihilism. It never repeats itself, it does not stutter, and it absolutely never apologizes.

2022-02-09,Alan Ranta,7,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",OMBIIGIZI Make Noise with a Purpose on 'Sewn Back Together',,"Nobody lives forever. We only have a brief window to use our voices to influence the world. The debut album from Adam Sturgeon and Daniel Monkman's OMBIIGIZI is all about seizing that moment and using it to speak meaningfully and loudly.    OMBIIGIZI is the Ojibwe term for a loud, noisy or disturbing person. Living up to their name, the band's debut album  Sewn Back Together  has an undeniable presence. Its noise has purpose.    Noted guitarists and songwriters, Sturgeon and Monkman have drawn a fair amount of attention on their own. The buzzing shoegaze of Monkman's  Zoon  made it onto the 2021 Polaris Music Prize short list with  Bleached Wavves , while the sludgy psych of Sturgeon's  Status/Non-Status  (f.k.a.  WHOOP-Szo ) landed on the 2020 long list with  Warrior Down .    Both of those projects explored their personal histories as Anishnaabe artists. A primary theme of  Bleached Waves  was Monkman's path to sobriety, forged through the traditional Anishnaabe healing philosophy the Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers, while Sturgeon put his grandfather on the cover for  Warrior Down . Together, the duo journey further than ever as OMBIIGIZI.    Their first full-length,  Sewn Back Together , was produced in part by  Broken Social Scene 's  Kevin Drew  alongside Nyles Spencer at the Tragically Hip's Bathouse Studio, where they recorded in quick bursts for maximum impact. With a little aid from drummers Eric Lourenço and Drew McLeod, who respectively play in Zoon and Status/Non-Status, the gang jammed out at least a couple of songs every session, and the pace worked. What the record lacks in polish, it makes up for in immediacy.    Even though the duo temper the  moccasin-gaze  distortion and grungy sludge established on their individual works, OMBIIGIZI's debut still sounds quite heavy, as it's indebted to the last few decades of alternative rock. Incendiary instrumental ""Niiyo"" channels the hard-charging indie rock energy of ""Are You Ready"" from the Tragically Hip's  In Violet Light  into love for My Bloody Valentine. Powerful lyrics like ""white picket fences at the cemetery"" from ""Residential Military"" mingle with slacker art-rock swagger to evoke mid-career Sonic Youth.    ""Zaagitoon"" (meaning ""treasure it"") is a floating downtempo dream pop dirge with wistful, Auto-Tune-glitched vocals that almost sound like rushing water — an effect at once technological and elemental. This is similarly contrasted by the emo wailing of survival ballad ""Spirit in Me"" and the folksy spiritual chanting of ""Yaweh,"" or in ""Birch Bark Paper Trails,"" which portrays the patriarchal tension of achieving recognized status amidst At the Drive-In sonics and field recordings of bird calls. These songs are equally at home in lofts or by campfires — wherever people share stories in comfort, to comfort, even if they may be uncomfortable to hear.    With all these styles woven together as part of an essential and ongoing social conversation,  Sewn Back Together  is ultimately a work of healing. With introspective, emotional resonance and formidable guitar tones, OMBIIGIZI's noise cuts through the static, loud and proud.

His signature voice and raunchy style, matched with his expert-level beat selection, allow for his versatility to shine through, while his legend status nets him refreshing featured guests who never overshadow Chainz.    Loosely narrated with scripted hustler talk, the album's 12 tracks are held together by 2 Chainz's aura and voice more so than by melodic progression. The bouncy, BeatKing-produced ""Pop Music"" (featuring an in-form Moneybagg Yo) contrasts with the grimy ""Vlad TV,"" yet 2 Chainz's hypnotic flow and humorous lyrical approach remain the underlying constant. ""Neighbors Know My Name"" will transport listeners back to the snap music era with its glitchy sounds and disjointed melody, while the same deconstructed vibe is felt on opener ""Bet it Back.""    Impressively, Chainz's collaborations feel sincere, a direct reflection of his consistency and the respect he has garnered throughout his years in the game. Rookie superstars 42 Dugg (""Million Dollars Worth of Game"") and  NBA YoungBoy  (""10 Bracelets"") elevate their spitting, while young OGs like  Lil Baby  (""Kingpen Ghostwriter"") and  Lil Durk  (""Lost Kings""), who can be known to phone features in, go the extra mile in delivering quality verses. Unfortunately, ""Outstanding"" is anything but, as it offers jumbled production and an uninspired  Roddy Ricch  hook — a rare dud in this otherwise ironclad selection of songs.    While  Dope Don't Sell Itself  does not inspire immediate playback like Chainz's last outing,  So Help Me God! ,  and doesn't contain the breakout hits of 2017's acclaimed  Pretty Girls Like Trap Music , it is a testament to the rapper's longevity and his vital role in ATL's shifting scene as a gravitational figure for all to aspire to become.

2022-02-15,A. Harmony,7,"SOUL & FUNK,R&B,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Moonchild Place Comfort at the Core of Creation on 'Starfruit',,"Moonchild 's fifth studio effort is a pleasant contradiction. On one hand, the California trio offer comforting sameness: warm, soothing coffee shop soul, anchored by lead singer Amber Navran's trademark feather-light vocals. On the other hand, the group reinvent themselves with new synths, experimental audio effects and the best new addition: artist features. The combination of old and new makes for a fresh sound that still feels cozily familiar.     Like their previous albums, Moonchild keep  Starfruit 's mood even-keeled from beginning to end. The music is heartfelt, yes, but there are no vigorous rises or falls. This is both the album's charm and its main flaw: while its steadiness does make for the perfect lazy Sunday listen, at times the album blurs the line between consistent and stagnant. For better or worse, it's the kind of music that can play in the background without stealing too much attention.     To that effect, no one song on  Starfruit  grabs the spotlight entirely. But there are a few tracks worthy of a repeat, like the gentle, innocent tale of love's beginnings on ""Too Good."" ""By Now"" blends faint whispers of gospel with its motivational claps and uplifting lyrics; Navran animates this track with a spirited vocal performance. ""Last Time"" is hypnotic and unhurried, bringing horn, bass and flute together in a perfect, boozy blend.     The album's features add some dimension to the project and serve as a stretch exercise for Moonchild. Alex Isley's airy voice tucks itself seamlessly on ""You Got One,"" while Navran's delicate harmonies bend themselves around Lalah Hathaway's rich, husky tones on ""Tell Him"".    A lively verse from Snow Hill, NC, spitfire  Rapsody  on ""Love I Need"" serves as  Starfruit 's most energetic moment. With this one, Moonchild liven up their approach to match her pace as a thumping beat and punchy bassline drive the track forward. Cleverly, though, the band leaves tranquil pockets for Navran's delicate melodies to shine.    Feeling good from the first track, and maintaining that pleasantness throughout,  Starfruit  gently pushes Moonchild forward, but not radically enough to disappoint long-time fans.

2022-01-19,Safiya Hopfe,8,"INDUSTRIAL,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Tanya Tagaq Leaves Little Unsaid on 'Tongues',,"Inuk musician, author, painter, activist and mother  Tanya Tagaq  was not raised on the several-thousand-year-old art of throat singing. After moving at the age of five to Ikaluktutiak (Cambridge Bay), an extremely remote town in the northern reaches of Nunavut, Tagaq found herself in a community where assimilation to a Christian English-speaking way of life was an entrenched priority. Although listening to records was a constant during her upbringing, it was not until her 20s that Tagaq began reclaiming this vocal tradition. Much to the bewilderment of her roommates, she began experimenting in the shower. In an eventual fluke, some of Björk's friends heard her improvise at the Great Northern Arts Festival, which she was attending to showcase her visual art. A couple of years later, Tagaq and Björk were touring together and collaborating.    Tagaq's platform grew dramatically when she  took home the 2014 Polaris Music Prize  for  Animism , an uninhibited sonic experiment which wove the earthy tradition of Inuk throat-singing into a tapestry of eerie harmonies and violent rhythms. Since then, the messages embedded in Tagaq's varied artistic expressions have only grown clearer. In her Polaris Gala performance, she sang before a scrolling list of the missing and murdered Indigenous women to whom she had dedicated her album.  Retribution , released in 2016 at a pivotal moment of reckoning across so-called Canada, saw Tagaq sing, scream and whisper about colonialism's inevitable repercussions. In her 2018 novel-memoir  Split Tooth , poetic truth dissolved into mythical horror as she painted a portrait of Indigenous life in the harsh North.    On her latest full-length record, aptly titled  Tongues , Tagaq is more explicit than ever. ""You can't have my tongue,"" she repeats again and again on the title track, emphasizing the resilience of Indigenous voices despite all that has attempted to silence them. ""I don't want your shame,"" she continues. ""It doesn't belong to me."" On ""Colonizer,"" breathy grunts and mutterings of ""Oh, you're guilty"" melt into cacophonous distortions, emulating the rage of the battered earth itself.     Tongues , produced by  Saul Williams  and mixed by  Gonjasufi , employs steady synthetic rhythms and lucid electronic soundscapes to amplify Tagaq's poetic prowess. On ""Teeth Agape"" and ""I Forgive Me,"" she speaks with unflinching clarity — against eerily unembellished backdrops — of the wisdom and agony of survival, sliding subtly in and out of throat singing. In ""Do Not Fear Love,"" a hypnotic ode to the durability of the emotional body despite trauma, ambient humming haunts gnawingly honest prose. Tagaq speaks to her oppressors — ""eat your morals,"" she spits.    But above all, she speaks to and for Indigenous children who have been scarred by the same violence that has scarred her. ""We were entered too young,"" she sings, saying that the past has ""birthed the bricks"" which build her bones. ""They can't protect themselves."" Tagaq's testimonials are raw and soaked in grief, but in every verse of mourning is a reclamation of personal power.    Tagaq's talent as a throat singer and capacity to weave meaning through chaos is as breathtaking as ever. That said,  Tongues  demonstrates that her musical toolkit is only growing with the refinement of her message. In some ways, this means embracing simplicity. If her former work has been marked by the seismic intensity of rage and crisis, Tagaq's latest record encapsulates the power of the pulse heard in the aftermath of the storm. After all, disaster has already struck, and sometimes healing is a quiet process.    When Tagaq swaps swirling pandemonium for crystalline repetition and shoegaze-y ambience, no intensity is lost. The heart of Tagaq's power as an artist is in her voice, and not just due to her mastery of vocal variation. Her enunciation of concise poetry over understated rhythms is an aural experience which transcends the craft of spoken word. As she speaks her truth, she does so without stuttering, hesitating only to come up — deftly and deliberately — for air.     At a time when ""reconciliation"" is the word on so many lips, Tagaq's verses leave no room for settler guilt or empty bureaucratic gestures.  Tongues  zooms in on the ugly details of colonial violence, and makes one thing, above all else, achingly clear: healing is not optional. It is the only way forward.

2022-02-16,Allie Gregory,8,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Alice Glass Eviscerates Her Past with 'PREY//IV',,"Darkwave veteran  Alice Glass  has re-emerged with  PREY//IV , her debut solo album and first release in five years. The record — a decidedly anti-Ethan Kath body of work and self-described ""culmination of years of literal blood, sweat, sobs, screams and tears"" — is no easy listen, and it shouldn't be. Tackling uneasy topics such as trauma, revenge, domestic and sexual abuse with cathartic reverie, the artist born Margaret Osborn hits back at an abuser she's feared for years with violent jubilation.      As much as  PREY//IV  is a triumph, its topics also inhabit a deeply uncomfortable headspace; the work is near inseparable from the trauma that inspired it, and thus should come with a heavy trigger warning for listeners. Standout single  ""SUFFER AND SWALLOW""  embodies the very evil Osborn endured succinctly, with the artist weaponizing psychologically torturous tactics in its lyrics, flipping and aiming them back at her abuser.      It's an artistic choice the musician leans into throughout the record, which seems to bounce lyrically between direct quotes and descriptions of the heinous acts themselves. ""PINNED BENEATH LIMBS"" is another such example, a song whose words speak to isolation tactics used by perpetrators of abuse: ""Don't talk to your friends / Don't talk to your family / Don't tell anyone / You're not worth believing,"" Glass sings.      Much like Osborn's 2017 EP,  PREY//IV  is nestled somewhere between the aesthetic worlds of fellow Canadians Nicole Dollanganger and Grimes, as well as American counterparts Salem, 100 gecs and HEALTH. The industrial-hyperpop dabbler employs the gothic cawing of crows and comforting purrs of cats on a pair of songs, and elsewhere on the album's 13 tracks, she sprinkles in tasteful doses of static haze, blood-drenched spoken word and trap production. ""BABY TEETH"" in particular is an exploration into darker hyperpop palettes, while ""WITCH HUNT"" and ""SUFFER IN PEACE"" offer glitchier, witch house-derived elements that Osborn inhabits quite naturally.      On the whole,  PREY//IV  expresses a dance-when-you're-sad energy that Glass and Kath never quite achieved with  Crystal Castles , and that Kath and Glass stand-in Edith Frances have yet to capture since the enigmatic former frontwoman's departure. The combined influences of genre showcase an artist coming into her own unified sound, after years of toiling with an identity that could have been stripped from her, had she not been as resilient as she shows herself to be on this debut. If nothing else,  PREY//IV   proves that society has moved past the need for Crystal Castles. Long may Alice Glass reign in their stead.

2022-02-15,Matt Bobkin,7,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",Spoon Try a Little Tenderness on 'Lucifer on the Sofa',,"You could never accuse  Spoon  of chasing trends or flashing in the pan. The Austin rockers have evolved subtly and deliberately over the last three decades, venturing in a straight line through the heart of Southern fried rock 'n' roll swagger since 1996's  Telephono , growing slowly but surely in a laidback, self-assured manner befitting their trademark tousled nonchalance. In any given decade, an artist may rise and fall, but that's how long it took for the seeds of Spoon's psychedelia, planted on 2007's  Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga , to fully bloom as they did on 2017's  Hot Thoughts .    Spoon continue to deal in gradual changes on  Lucifer on the Sofa , their 10th album. Positioned as a comparatively stripped-down, back-to-basics affair, what it loses in texture it adds in newfound vulnerability, following up  Hot Thoughts ' youthful lust with the vulnerability of fresh love, pushing its foregrounded psychedelia into the margins and letting emotions fill the space.    The band's largely no-frills, playfully cool rock music has typically kept feelings at an arm's length, opting for vague abstractions over anything particularly soul-baring. Here, the band aim for the heart, and the resulting tracks are some of their most relatable, direct material. It's apparent from the very first number, a cover of Smog's ""Held"" (which has appeared in Spoon set lists as far back as 2004) in Spoon's business casual style. The words may not be Britt Daniel's, but the iconic Bill Callahanisms sound fitting in his signature scratchy howl: ""For the first time in my life / I let myself be held / Like a big old baby.""    The catharsis seeps into the rest of the album. In contrast to the ""Small Stakes"" Spoon sang about on the opening track to 2002's  Kill the Moonlight ,  Lucifer  succeeds when it embraces the heft of new love, relying on the textures of recent albums to help carry the weight on tracks like ""My Babe,"" ""Astral Jacket"" and ""Satellite."" Sparer arrangements and slower tempos show Spoon embracing vulnerability, relying on charmed storytelling over their typical too-cool-for-school self-assurance. Where safer album cuts like ""Feels Alright,"" ""Wild"" and ""On the Radio"" opt for more-trodden territory, coasting on the strengths of jangling guitar hooks, there's a refreshing vulnerability when Daniel drops the doe-eyed ""You got angels above you / I know I love you more"" on ""Satellite.""    When you have something worth treasuring, that means you have something to lose, and it gives Spoon's moodier, more tense songs a hardened edge. ""The Devil and Mister Jones"" and the title track — in what is surely not a coincidence — are both teeming with devils and other shadowy threats lurking about, with the latter veering straight into foggy, horn-dappled paranoia like the soundtrack to a neo-noir. The endless fight against bad-faith actors has long served as a recurring element in Daniel's lyrics, and the way that they serve as a potent counterpoint to the hope and commitment of the album's more lovelorn tracks elevates the album's world-building, adding storytelling strengths to the mix.    Spoon's deliberate, earnest shifts in sound and subject matter continue to make them one of the more compelling and consistent older-guard rock bands. By pairing their well-honed blues rock temerity with genuine emotional weight, Spoon continue to wring new ideas out of classic sounds without veering into gimmick, staying consistent without getting stale.

2022-02-16,Kaelen Bell,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Beach House's 'Once Twice Melody' Is Not Quite Enough and Just a Bit Too Much,,"Beach House  have managed to build a legendary catalogue of mystifying, awe-inspiring music thats strength lies both in its sameness and its subtle maturation. They perfected the wheel years ago; the thrill has been in hearing them play with its impeccable form, popping on some spinning rims or knocking out spokes as needed.    And so, if we're going by score cards and expected patterns, the massive double album is arriving right on time. The 18-track, 85-minute  Once Twice Melody  is designed, in the grand legacy of major albums from major bands, to be Beach House's crown jewel. It's the record that's meant to gather all the good will and artistic depth they've cultivated in the last decade and change, blowing it up to sky-scraping, Olympic proportions. For the most part, it succeeds.    To say Beach House are incapable of making a bad song would likely be a lie. However, as of this writing, Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally have never released a truly bad song. Even at their most comfortable, the fundamentals of the duo's sound will yield a listenable (beautiful, usually) piece of escapist dreampop. The issue with  Once Twice Melody  is that it tends to confirm this theory.     Once Twice Melody  is not quite enough and just a bit too much. It's not an issue of runtime — there's little doubt that Beach House are entirely capable of making a dynamic, engaging 18-track (or longer) album. It's more so a flaw in sequencing and production choices, a failure to account for the record's overwhelming, distinction-dissolving nature when it's being heard consecutively and not in  the four EP-length dispatches in which it was released . There's also, at times, the difficult-to-shake feeling that the band is on autopilot, as if you've heard these songs before despite their beefier, new-fangled trappings.    The duo self-produced for the first time in their careers, and while the record sounds routinely gorgeous — luxe and lush, colourful and surprisingly confronting — there's a verging-on-obnoxious lack of negative space in the arrangements. Nearly every opportunity for silence is filled with washes of reverb, tides of synth or weeping strings, like air suffocated by pollen. It has the effect of a weighted blanket, a silken heaviness that begins to settle uncomfortably on your bones after more than an hour of gilded maximalism. The album's overwhelming sonic enormity is by design — in  an interview with Apple Music , Scally pointed to the blockbuster opulence of '80s pop and metal, describing how the duo found inspiration in music that ""almost felt gaudy, but it was so intense and powerful."" They certainly embodied that glitter-bomb (maybe more of a paillette-torpedo) heft, taking their already-shimmery music to a place of total, world-swallowing fantasy.    But after the first eight tracks — seven of which stretch beyond four minutes — it just feels like a lot, as if you're listening to a weapons-grade singles collection rather than an album of songs meant to converse with and inform one another. For all the talk of sonic diversity, the songs on  Once Twice Melody  have a strange sameness to them, an immense wave of fluorescent sound that manages to overwhelm the subtle textures that should set them apart.    These qualms (while fundamental to the listening experience) are forgivable, and even sometimes forgettable, when the album works. This is Beach House after all, and the duo's relative stumbles still make for gorgeous and occasionally show-stopping music. ""Pink Funeral,"" ""New Romance,"" ""Superstar"" and ""Only You Know"" can stand tall alongside the band's strongest songs, and the record manages to find some dynamic footing on the second half — ebbing and flowing in a way that the previous 40 minutes does not — despite most of the best tracks belonging to the first.    And though the familiarity with the duo's melodic and instrumental choices is often difficult to shake,  Once Twice Melody  does find them traversing new ground: the guitar-free synthpop of the menacing ""Masquerade"" or spritely ""Hurts to Love"" feel more swift-footed than the churning bangers that precede them, while the gorgeous ""Finale"" finds the duo dismantling their sound and refashioning it into something more sharp and metallic. Still, these experiments can't help but feel like Legrand and Scally pulling back from the twisted majesty of  7 , sanding off some of that record's more dangerous corners.    Beach House songs have rarely been about capturing particulars; Legrand's lyrics are typically impressionistic, abstracted vignettes that aim to capture the wild essence of feeling rather than be bogged down in specifics. But on  Once Twice Melody , Legrand's dreamworld lyrical preoccupations — boys, girls, day, night, stars, diamonds, mirrors, swans, and horizons and lights of all varieties — become frustratingly faceless. There are pockets of illuminating narrative, like the dispatch from the passenger seat on the acoustic, glittering ""Bells,"" but it's hard to shake the feeling that you could play a game of Beach House Mad Libs and come away with the same result.    While the album is epic in scope and regularly beautiful,  Once Twice Melody  feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. A Beach House record is best experienced like a shooting star, thrilling for its relative scarcity and singular propulsion.  Once Twice Melody  feels more like a sunset than a shot of light from the universe's depths — magnificent and enormous, yes, but also familiar.    Here was Beach House's chance to send an asteroid at their patiently-evolving planet, to blow things apart and sculpt something new from the mountains of rubble. Maybe that's too much to expect, and it likely isn't what the majority of Beach House fans would even want. So instead, we get another glittering reassurance of the band's singular presence, another chance to bask in what it is they do so well. There are far worse gifts to be given than consistency.  ( Sub Pop )                           POP AND ROCK   REVIEWS   ALBUM   MUSIC              More Beach House",https://exclaim.ca/music/article/beach_house_once_twice_melody_album_review
2022-01-20,Paul Dika,7,"METAL AND HARDCORE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Comeback Kid Relish the Challenge of Moving Forward on 'Heavy Steps',,"Comeback Kid  continue to propel forward. The collective have navigated side projects, lineup changes and a pandemic to boot since their debut album  Turn It Around  came out almost twenty years ago. And while their sound has developed to showcase the versatility in the band's songwriting ability, the heavy hooks and urgency that initially drew fans to the band have always been there. Comeback Kid's latest album,  Heavy Steps , amalgamates those initial strengths with a seasoned approach to songwriting that comes with being a band for nearly two decades.     Following 2017's  Outsider ,  Heavy Steps  is filled with gigantic breakdowns, crunchy palm-muted riffs, and gang vocals that will entice long-time fans of the band. Written and recorded in their former hometown of Winnipeg, the album was produced by John Paul Peters, who also produced  Turn It Around . While certain aspects of the record feel like a return to form, there are far more elements at play than when the band last collaborated with Peters.     Heavy Steps  blends those hardcore techniques with punk sensibilities on songs like ""Face the Fire,"" ""Everything Relates,"" and album closer ""Menacing Weight."" Vocalist Andrew Neufeld flexes his versatility as he flaunts his signature sharp growl in the verses, while delivering more melodic vocals in the chorus .  In addition to the vocals, Jeremy Hiebert and Stu Ross incorporate more guitar leads, and shiny octave chords that provide texture to the songs.     Although the record fuses hardcore and punk (perhaps even a tinge of metalcore) at times, this is still a Comeback Kid album, meaning a good chunk of the eleven songs skew towards hardcore. The opening title track is the perfect example, on which Chase Brenneman's fat and juicy bass lead pairs well with drummer Loren Legare's pounding of the snare, leading to a guitar riff that sets the tone for the rest of the listen.    From there, Comeback Kid build on that foundation with songs like ""Crossed"" (featuring Joe Duplantier of Gojira), ""Shadow of Doubt"", and ""Dead on the Fence"", which features perhaps the most pummelling breakdown on the album. Each of these aforementioned tracks is thrust forward by an underlying energy, intense but measured, never reaching a frenetic point.     Lyrically,  Heavy Steps  focuses on the struggle to keep moving forward in spite of the distractions, challenges and hurdles that stand in the way, which sounds about right for an album written in the middle of a pandemic. ""Shadow of Doubt"" captures that feeling quite blatantly, as yells of ""This doubt hovering over me, overshadowing power"" echo throughout the song. This theme matches the trajectory and mindset of a band focused on persevering through times of uncertainty. On ""Face the Fire,"" Neufeld exclaims, ""A product of change, through a prodding for pain,"" and ""We're still banging that drum, and we'll see what happens'' signalling that, through all the ups and downs, Comeback Kid will keep evolving and persisting.    Cohesive as the themes and lyrics are, a more subtle approach would improve the songs as a whole. Lines like ""Been a while since the enemy shanked us"" on ""No Easy Way Out"" and ""These stabs only hurt me,"" on album closer ""Menacing Weight"" may fit the hardcore aesthetic, but teeter between heavy and corny, distracting from the instrumental strengths that exist within those tracks.     Outside those lyrical missteps,  Heavy Steps  succeeds in capturing the experience and skill cultivated by a band over almost twenty years. Instead of becoming a legacy band, Comeback Kid have made the decision to challenge themselves, and their fans by expanding their sound, and redefining who and what they can be. And if  Heavy Steps  is any indication, the band and their fans will be happy with that decision.

2022-01-20,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,8,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Les Louanges Drives His Sound in Many Directions but Doesn't 'Crash',,"The refreshing funkiness and relatable lyrical content of  La nuit est une panthère , the 2018 debut album by Vincent Roberge's  Les Louanges  project, earned the Montrealer critical acclaim, including three Félix Awards (from nine nominations), and a slot on the Polaris Music Prize shortlist. It also jumpstarted high expectations for follow-up  Crash , a 15-song opus which is significantly more serious and narratively driven than its predecessor. Although the candour is not lost, the bubbling melodic innocence is replaced by a faster-paced, new wave-influenced sound.    Despite its narrative confines, Roberge casts a wide net of inspirations throughout the album's tracklist, exploding Les Louanges' sound in many ways.  Crash 's melodies, hooks and vocals drive moodier moments on tracks like ""Bolero"" and ""Encore."" Meanwhile, euphoric guitar strums are often contrasted by stringent synth lines, with a broad spectrum ranging from the feisty ""Cruze"" to the floating ""Pigeons.""    With their raw percussiveness and big bass lines, songs like the pulsating ""Qu'est-ce que tu me fais"" and experimental ""Chaperon"" yearn to be blasted from a big sound system, yet the grandeur is balanced by tender, self-reflective efforts like ""Facile."" As the album progresses, Roberge showcases the breadth of his songwriting ability with the gorgeously stripped-down ""Déziel"" and the pop sensibilities of the title track.    Finally, the aptly titled ""Dernière"" is a fitting conclusion to a dense yet coherent album in which Roberge takes calculated risks.  Crash  is certainly not the road that a musician trying to grow his newly earned fanbase would take. Instead of milking a tried and true formula and emulating past successes, Les Louanges drives off-course and ultimately takes listeners on a wild ride.

2022-01-27,Michael Di Gennaro,6,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,EP,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Jacques Greene's 'Fantasy' Captures the Formless Drift of Lockdown Life,,"When detailing his newest EP,  Fantasy , on  Instagram , Montreal producer and DJ  Jacques Greene  explained that the inspiration behind it was a desire to create a feeling of escapism from the pandemic nightmare the world has been mired in for the last two years. Greene has always been an artist who has produced music with a specific purpose: his early work as part of the early '10s class of bedroom producers looked to innovate by fusing house, techno, R&B and hip-hop; his mid-2010s run of tracks was designed for the clubs he played; and his most recent full-length, 2019's  Dawn Chorus , was created with the idea of soundtracking the part of the night that comes after the parties, festivals and nights on the town are over. Now, Canada is at a point where the nights out dancing and the memories made afterward are gone — a two-year drought that has clearly affected Greene's approach to where and why his music is played.    Part of why Greene has always had success translating his music into nightlife is because of where he lives. He credits Montreal rave godfather Tiga with inspiring his love of electronic music and DJing, and many of his generation's biggest electronic stars — Grimes, Chromeo, A-Trak, Kaytranada — hail from the same city as him. Montreal might be the closest thing to a truly European experience that you can have across all of North America, with its cobblestone historical district, seemingly endless number of cafes and restaurants, and clubs that open at midnight and close near noon. It's for those reasons that Montreal has had a particularly significant cultural struggle with COVID. It is a place defined by eating, drinking and dancing with one another, in a time where all of those activities have become a health risk to the point where they have to be prohibited.     Fantasy  can be seen as Greene's answer to the activities that replaced clubbing in the COVID era. In the same way that looking forward to a night out made the long, gruelling work week seem tolerable, daydreaming about the time when the pandemic is a thing of the past has surely kept many people sane and hopeful since the first shutdown in March 2020. The EP is closer to full-on ambient music than anything Greene has released before, with his aforementioned Instagram post also noting that he was striving to make more formless and ""floating"" songs.    At its best,  Fantasy  accomplishes just that. Opener ""Taurus,"" closer ""Don't Leave"" and centrepiece ""Relay"" all pair Greene's signature airy, sample-heavy loops with light, muted drums. These tracks achieve exactly what ambient music was created to do: compliment day-to-day activities, whether it be working, socializing, exercising or just thinking. It can be argued that Greene's music has always translated nicely for an ambient context, but where  Fantasy  falls short compared to the rest of his discography is that applying formlessness to a sound that is already that atmospheric can push it a bit too far in the background. Even after repeated listens, it can be tough to remember what certain songs sound like.    Compared to the hard-hitters on 2017's  Feel Infinite  and 2018's  Fever Focus , along with the expansive scope of  Dawn Chorus , the lack of fully-formed songs on  Fantasy  may be a disappointment for some listeners. Perhaps that's why Greene felt the need to explain his headspace when making it; though stylistically similar, the listening experience is vastly different from anything else he's ever made.    It may not be the body of work of his that is looked back on as seminal, but  Fantasy  is exactly the type of music that can help alleviate the stress COVID has caused the public, and in that sense, the EP succeeds in fulfilling what it sought to achieve. Greene may look to continue exploring musical formlessness and improve upon the groundwork the project sets, or he may explore completely new directions. The only thing that seems certain is that Jacques Greene will make the music that he knows the people need, whenever they need it.

2022-01-27,Luke Pearson,7,"ALBUM,MUSIC,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK","Ghostly Kisses Offers Haunting Pop Drama on 'Heaven, Wait'",,"Up-and-coming Quebec City-based artist Margaux Sauvé (working professionally here as  Ghostly Kisses ) has released makes her precocious and often beautiful debut with  Heaven, Wait . Immaculately produced to bring her breathy, up-close vocal right into your ear, there's a lot to like here — especially if tags like ""sophisticated,"" ""avant-garde"" or ""minimalistic"" are wont to auto-fill your search bar. Its high-drama brooding might tip over into art-school preciousness every now and then, but this is quite a solid debut.    The album is divided into roughly two styles: easygoing, progressive-lite tracks that pulse and bubble with crisp 808-style toms and kicks, along with songs that highlight piano, acoustic guitar and string arrangements. Individual taste will guide one's preference here (and there are tracks that straddle both), but memorability seems to favour the former, with the more upbeat rhythms providing a welcome counterpoint to Sauvé's generally sombre chords and mournful vocal style. The softly bouncing ""Heartbeat"" and previously released title track (do yourself a favour and  check out the gorgeous video for this one ) open the album strongly in this mode for instance, setting the bar high.    It's a bit of a disappointment then that the wait for more of the same is so long, with most of the album's middle devoted to more minimalistic acoustic tracks that, while they showcase Sauvé's vocals nicely and have a cold, echoing production all their own, seem less fully realized, getting lost in their swirling Byronic gloom just for the sake of it sometimes (although the Middle Eastern-inspired instrumentation of ""Blackbirds"" stands out). This is made especially apparent when ""Carry Me"" arrives later on and grabs your attention immediately with its subdued Imogen Heap or Everything but the Girl energy, lifting the album to new heights. How this track has been overlooked as a single can only be explained by a desire to showcase  Heaven, Wait 's diversity instead — which isn't necessarily its strength (three co-producers are on hand here, with artists like Birdy and Aurora on their resumes, as well as heavy-hitters St. Vincent and Florence + the Machine).    In any event, it's the start of a strong finish for  Heaven, Wait , with the almost Enya-like vocal on ""Play Dead"" adding a nice, if fleeting, touch, and ""Green Book"" providing an undeniably pretty piano ballad in the penultimate spot. Some added momentum or urgency might be helpful to better shape the melancholy in future, but the same was probably said of early Fiona Apple or Tori Amos. Sauvé treads her artist path well and with purpose.

2022-01-28,Adam Feibel,2,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Our Lady Peace's 'Spiritual Machines II' Is a Clumsy Sequel,,"Sequels are a high-risk, low-reward proposition. How often are they better than the original? How often are they even  as good  as the original? Not very. The road to pop-cultural hell is paved with well-intended reboots, revivals, retrospectives and reunions. Now,  Our Lady Peace 's  Spiritual Machines II  joins a long line of ill-advised sequels, and for fans of arguably the Canadian alt-rockers' most widely praised record, this one might hurt.    Released at the tail end of the year 2000, the original  Spiritual Machines  put forth brainy, high-concept rock at a time when Radiohead had effectively changed the meaning of ""alternative rock"" with  OK Computer  and  Kid A.  Today,  Spiritual Machines  still holds up as a smart, invigorating and emotionally resonant rock record that's poppy, but still a bit gritty.    The album also marked the end of an era for Our Lady Peace, being the last album to fully feature the band's original guitarist Mike Turner, the last to be helmed by longtime producer Arnold Lanni and, until now, the last to feature model Saul Fox on the album cover. The band would go on to adopt a noticeably more mainstream rock sound on 2002's  Gravity  and beyond .    Like its predecessor,  Spiritual Machines II  is inspired by the ideas and predictions of inventor and futurist Raymond Kurzweil. Likewise, it features several spoken excerpts of Kurzweil himself interspersed between the tracks. Several of the songs are tie-ins: ""Future Disease"" is meant to be a segue from the original' album's finale ""The Wonderful Future,"" ""Wish You Well"" serves as a sequel to ""Are You Sad?"" and ""Temporary Healing"" feels like a reprise of ""In Repair."" Original guitarist Turner even has a small role. (Barely a footnote, really. It turns out that Turner contributed the musical backdrop to the minute-long interlude ""RK4.Escape Velocity"" — a holdover from the original  Spiritual Machines  sessions.)    But in sound and spirit,  Spiritual Machines II  is worlds apart. It's not that Our Lady Peace should have made a record that's exactly like the original; artists grow and evolve over time, and an artistically motivated sequel should reflect that. But this tacky pop effort would be a misstep at any time in Our Lady Peace's career — the fact that it's  Spiritual Machines II,  the sequel to one of their most beloved records, only makes matters worse .  Producer Dave Sitek reportedly described the album as "" future rock ,"" while singer  Raine Maida  has called it "" anti-rock ."" These terms would be pretentious and self-indulgent enough already, but when you hear the music they're describing, it makes them look pitifully out of touch with what's on the cutting edge of modern music.  Spiritual Machines II  is the opposite of futuristic — it's accidentally retro in unflattering ways.    ""Future Disease"" takes a stab at dance-rock, but it's far too lethargic for actual dancing. ""Stop Making Stupid People Famous"" is an overly kitschy pop tune that spoils a guest feature by  Pussy Riot 's Nadya Tolokonnikova on a lyrical premise akin to a Facebook meme. ""19 Days"" sounds like Maroon 5 without any of the sex appeal. ""The Message"" takes a cue from the vaguely Middle Eastern sounds of  Naveed  and warps it into funky electro-pop. ""Run"" sounds like a TV commercial for activewear. (All of that said, you have to give credit to the musicianship of bassist Duncan Coutts, who flourishes in his role even in this ill-conceived project.)    These songs take OLP out of the realm of sophisticated alt-rock and into the world of generic pop-rock you mostly hear in shopping malls. You could compare it to something like Muse, the Killers or Franz Ferdinand instead; either way, it's uninventive and dated. The future, apparently, sounds like 2006. If the original  Spiritual Machines  had sounded like Tears for Fears and Duran Duran, it surely would have been roundly rejected.    Some of it almost works.  Spiritual Machines II  is most palatable when the band goes for a sound that's more or less ""Radiohead meets U2."" The quick gear-shifting of ""Simulation"" comes closest to succeeding at their idea of futuristic rock. ""Good Die Young"" is a knotty and complex, yet firmly grounded bit of artsy soft-rock. While it's a bit too sappy, ""Wish You Well"" is a synth-heavy, inspirational rocker that recalls their transitional era of  Healthy in Paranoid Times . The hard-nosed melodies of ""Holes"" could've made for a standout track, but it's far too repetitive to make a real impact.    A sequel to  Spiritual Machines  was a promising concept with the potential to bring back fans who had lost interest over the years. Unfortunately, the result totally backfires as Our Lady Peace grasp for ways to stay in the zeitgeist. In 2000,  Spiritual Machines  found the band at their artistic peak. Two decades later, their eyes are so pointed toward the future that they haven't noticed the present has passed them by.

2022-01-31,Jordan Currie,9,"MARCH 2022 ISSUE,FROM THE MAGAZINE,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Mitski Is Vulnerable and Mysterious in Equal Measure on 'Laurel Hell',,"After  Mitski Miyawaki  completed touring her acclaimed album  Be the Cowboy  in 2019, the singer-songwriter went dark. She deactivated her social media and  announced an indefinite break from music . ""I've been on non-stop tour for over five years,"" she tweeted. ""I haven't had a place to live during this time, & I sense that if I don't step away soon, my self-worth/identity will start depending too much on staying in the game, in the constant churn.""    The abundance of Mitski in 2018 and 2019, from her live shows to her sardonic Twitter personality, had reached a grinding halt. She assured her devoted audience that she wasn't permanently leaving music and this hiatus was only a break. In reality, she revealed in  a 2021  Rolling Stone  profile  that this promise wavered, and she seriously considered quitting music.    ""In order for me to survive in the music industry as it exists, I had to stuff a pillow over my heart and tell it to stop screaming, and be like, 'Shut up, shut up, take it,'"" she said in the profile. ""After a few years of doing that every single day, my heart really did start to go numb and go silent. And the problem with that is that I actually need my heart—my feelings in order to write music. It was this paradox.""    For all the burnout she endured, Mitski channelled it into music, this time setting boundaries from external pressures. The result is her sixth album,  Laurel Hell , a record that dresses up the themes of a standard Mitski song — yearning, belonging, fear, love — in flashy attire, all while oozing vulnerability. Continuing the path that  Be the Cowboy  paved,  Laurel Hell  is composed of vignette-like songs with the sounds of disco and pop taking centre stage.     Early singles capture the musician's exhaustive emotions. On ""Working for the Knife,"" she laments about the drain of working life and mourns what could've been. ""I used to think I'd be done by 20 / Now at 29, the road ahead appears the same,"" she sings. ""Heat Lightning"" is about recognizing your limits and succumbing to something greater than you, set to calming lo-fi beats. ""The Only Heartbreaker"" takes a stark change, an '80s new wave banger akin to A-ha, where Mitski grapples with feeling like she can't pull her weight in a relationship.    Despite the heaviness of the album's early singles, it's the opposite that opens it: ""Valentine, Texas"" is pure tenderness, beginning hushed and solemn before blossoming with liveliness midway through. Mitski is caught in the throes of new love, moulding herself into what she thinks the other person wants. Wanting to turn into a new person is a prominent motif, likely mirroring the uncertainty she felt contemplating her career.     Dance tracks recalling retro pop sensibilities and harrowing lyrics are plentiful. ""Stay Soft"" follows shortly thereafter, serving as a sibling to mega-hit hit ""Nobody."" ""You stay soft, get beaten / Only natural to harden up,"" she says, providing love to someone who isn't willing to give it back, retreating into a shell caused by past wounds as peppy vocals swerve over disco beats. ""Should've Been Me"" is the upbeat love child of ABBA and Wham!, where Mitski apologises for not being what her partner needed, while stadium-sized ""Love Me More"" is the biggest, brightest, most glittery song in Mitski's entire discography, putting her unabashed starvation for affection on full display: ""Love enough to drown it out / Drown it out, drown me out"", she cries. On the bouncy and groovy closer ""That's Our Lamp,"" she reminisces about a fight with a partner.    But following every sweeping gesture is a moment of stillness. On the haunting ""Everyone,"" Mitski ruminates on the existential loop of life: ""Sometimes I think I am free / Until I find I'm back in line again."" Monotonous chords drone on for most of the song — until the last few seconds, where stunning piano trills kick in. ""There's Nothing Left for You"" is a bitter self-release, sombre and airy, disrupted by thrashing cymbals. Mitski lets go of the failed expectations from a lover, but still secretly wishes it was different. ""I Guess"" serves as a bookend — a resolve to this turmoil. She salutes an ex from the shore as they drift away at sea, and she accepts that she lost a part of herself in this connection, but thanks them in spite of everything. The interweaving of these songs is precise, giving the sense of partying and then going home alone to let whatever you've been repressing come to the surface.    Mitski's lack of presence in the public eye usually gets her branded enigmatic and secretive. Except she isn't, really — not in a musical sense, where her poetry bursts with raw truths and desires. In a radio interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, she stated that the album's title refers to the laurel bushes that grow in the Southern Appalachians in the US, where they're just as beautiful as they are isolated. She shows us these qualities of beauty and isolation are often two sides of the same coin, and can be married to uncover the intricate corners of a person's full truth.

2022-02-01,Allie Gregory,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Animal Collective Exit Their Flop Era on 'Time Skiffs',,"Animal Collective  set a high bar with their output in the 2000s, and then undeniably lost steam in the 2010s, a period that coincided with the band splintering off into varying iterations of hit-and-miss solo and multimedia projects. You'd be forgiven if you wrote them off entirely after that. Latest offering  Time Skiffs  — the proper follow-up to 2016's underwhelming  Painting With  — signals that, after all this time, traces remain of the artistically unified unit capable of groundbreaking pop experimentalism.    Returning to their signature twinkling arpeggiated synths on the bulk of the record's nine chunky tracks, the band hearken back to a pre- Merriweather  AnCo era, serving up some of the most accessible and least jarring tunes from the full ensemble since 2009 (save for 2020's  Bridge to Quiet  EP). Picking and choosing their best elements for a distillation of the band's decades-long discography — adding a heavy dose of nostalgia here and there — the pioneering psych-popsters press their freak folk through a chill-out filter, settling into their new phase as less hedonistic, mellowed-out dads, and delivering their best work in years.     Avey Tare 's intermittent yelping, once omnipresent, is traded out for the oft-eccentric vocalist's most subdued singing to date, especially on mid-album trip ""Cherokee,"" a euphoric, cheery wade into welcoming waters. Meanwhile,  Panda Bear 's reverberated, lush vocals (first perfected when he  met the Grim Reaper  back in 2015) are the foundation for  Time Skiffs ' second track ""Car Keys,"" a tune dripping with a brand of melancholy not typically endorsed in Noah Lennox's group work. Elsewhere, Lennox's Beach Boys sensibilities take on a SpongeBob-core quality (in a good way) on ""Strung with Everything.""     Further blending genre, xylophone-led ""Walker"" mixes trip-hop grooviness with more of Panda's Brian Wilson-isms in a fitting tribute to the late Scott Walker; ""Passer-by"" employs  Stardew Valley  organs sounds in a dusty desert haze; ""Royal and Desire"" sounds like a straight-up  Veckatimest  cut; while lead single ""Prester John"" is among the most natural incorporations of a hurdy-gurdy solo ever heard in pop music history. ""We Go Back,"" which dabbles in hyperpop vocal plug-ins, hints that the group are moving into their next era, and aren't necessarily satisfied relegating themselves to becoming a Xennial dad-rock legacy act.    With all the album's nostalgia-serving glory, we would be remiss to ignore the simultaneous resurgence of the ""indie sleaze"" era among the TikTok crowd, a cultural phenomenon that could propel Animal Collective's upswing with  Time Skiffs  into another golden era — if they play their cards right. Fingers crossed they can really up the ante on the next one.

2022-02-01,Alan Ranta,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK",Cate Le Bon Turns Isolation into a Creative Eruption on 'Pompeii',,"Isolation can lead to brilliance or madness, occasionally both. Having moved north of bustling Helsinki to the quiet artist community of Lake Tuusula, Finnish composer Jean Sibelius spent a decade or so struggling to write his eighth symphony before eventually throwing it into his dining room fireplace to ease his troubled mind. Escaping a sense of entrenched mediocrity in North Carolina, Justin Vernon broke up with his girlfriend, holed up in his dad's Wisconsin hunting cabin, and emerged months later with Bon Iver's instantly acclaimed  For Emma, Forever Ago .    Welsh singer-songwriter  Cate Le Bon  took the creative isolation approach to an extreme on this record. She literally sealed herself in the studio on Plantagenet Street in Cardiff, attempting to dissolve her ego, her sense of identity. Armed only with a bass guitar and her wits, she bore the weight of the world on her shoulders, and eventually emerged with the transcendent new experience we have before us, titled  Pompeii .    All the usual suspects are here, though. Longtime collaborator Samur Khouja returned to mix and help produce alongside Le Bon. Stephen Black (Sweet Baboo) and Euan Hinshelwood (Younghusband) slid in their scintillating saxophone from Studiowz in rural Pembrokeshire, while Stella Mozgawa (Warpaint) sent her jazz-laced drumming up from her own quarantine at Golden Retriever Studio in Australia. They kept the team together while in seclusion, the best of both worlds.    Le Bon does pretty much everything else on the record. All the other percussion, guitars, synths and piano, all the songs and arrangements — that is her. She has forged herself into a conduit of musical creativity. As such,  Pompeii  is imbued with the same instantly recognizable presence that enraptured the world on her 2019  Mercury Prize-nominated  fifth album,  Reward .    Gently tilting the perspective towards the bright side of life,  Pompeii  notably features classic synths like the Yamaha DX7. Le Bon used the synth tones intentionally to touch on city pop, a loose style of breezy, funky Japanese yacht rock that peaked in the early '80s. She also channeled the meditative, spiritual aura of a painting by DRINKS collaborator Tim Presley that hung on the wall during recording. Presley's painting was appropriately remade with the likeness of Le Bon for  Pompeii 's own cover art.    The overall effect is ageless yet ephemeral music, nostalgic yet of the now. It captures that prevalent sense of quiet panic and the struggle to retain any sense of time and human connection that has been the default mode of human existence for nearly all of the 2020s to date.    On ""Remembering Me,"" swirling synths, shimmering guitar whine and angelic vocals come together in one of the album's most additive hooks, like a futuristic Laurie Anderson jam with Eurythmics. The sleazy sax line and sci-fi steel drum sound in ""French Boys"" makes it sound like a downtrodden response to ""West End Girls"" by Pet Shop Boys, while the introspective tension and upbeat pluck of  ""Moderation""  sounds like Kate Bush on a good day. Though its lyrics speak of elusive love, lethargic dream-pop ditty ""Running Away"" has a sax crescendo so sexy it evokes George Michael.    With its melodic focus on the bass and heady lyrical vision expressed through quirky pop-tinged aesthetics, the album is full of moments that feel effortless while being thoughtful. Le Bon's serious, surreal poetic illuminations interpret the profound heaviness of our age without being obvious or quaint about it, weighing existential dread with the comforting nature of finality. Altogether,  Pompeii  lands somewhere between  Hejira -era Joni Mitchell and the solo work of Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier — rarified air where Le Bon undoubtedly belongs.

2022-02-02,Eric Hill,7,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC","Black Country, New Road Still Soar Above Their Peers on 'Ants from Up There'",,"With last year's  For the First Time , youthful and hypercharged UK septet  Black Country, New Road  rode a wave of accolades that swept them onto numerous year-end Best Of lists. They came on like a gang of high school band kids that chose smoking and red wine over virginity, watching Italian spy movies and trying to figure out how to play Slint covers with added horns and violins. The resulting rush of highly organized chaos earned them a spot of honour amid a rising tide of newly celebrated avant garde British rock bands like Black Midi, Squid and Dry Cleaning.     On follow-up  Ants from Up There , the pent up aggression that gave  For the First Time  its jagged shape has been largely smoothed away to reveal more gently curved, but equally peculiar topographies. Melding disparate obsessions that include the pulsing phases of Steve Reich and the cool rock persona of Billie Eilish,  Ants  trades occasional urgency with a slower uncoiling of its ideas.     Still, the band launches with a bang in the form of ""Chaos Space Marine,"" the album's lead single that boils down world-conquering aspirations and relationship anxiety, forging them into the shape of a  Warhammer 40,000  figurine, sounding a little like a Broadway-ready Arcade Fire tribute. That bloom-and-burst ambition runs through the entire middle of the album with songs opening in swaying balladry and graduating into desperate declaration.     Frontman Isaac Wood — who  announced his departure from the group  days before the album's arrival — probes both left and right brain in his writing, which nicely evades easy classification. There is a subtle, but never directly stated lockdown protocol that informs lyrics of songs like ""Concorde,"" expressing longing for motion and frustrated by unreachable distances and connections. A peculiar ghost of midwestern emo haunts his quavering delivery, especially on songs like ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""The Place Where He Inserted the Blade,"" recalling Bright Eyes in their earliest and most expansively desperate moments.     There is a bit of coasting after the midpoint of the album, but this serves as a calm before massive twin storms. ""Snow Globes"" is an incantation of pulsing guitar notes encircling an ever-approaching blizzard of free drumming that batters its fragile bubble and kinetically matches Wood's repeated refrain of  ""Oh god of weather, Henry knows / Snow globes don't shake on their own."" The album is capped by ""Basketball Shoes,"" a multi-chambered epic that has long lived as a concert centrepiece. Partly liberated from its initial wet dream musings on Charli XCX, it has become a broader confessional on the kind of longing that fills diary pages and requires an explosive finale.    Like many sophomore albums,  Ants from Up There  serves both as a clearing house for leftover ideas from the debut and a tentative next step in Black Country's evolution. Serving both purposes results in an album that doesn't necessarily have the same electrical charge as what came before and would benefit from a little trimming here and there. That said, the band is still inarguably one of the most exciting prospects in new music at the moment, and here, the highs are head and shoulders above the majority of their contemporaries.

2022-02-02,Chris Bryson,8,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,MODERN COMPOSITION,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC","Jean-Michel Blais Crafts Lush, Life-Affirming Compositions on 'aubades'",,"For  Jean-Michel Blais ,  aubades  is a rebirth. From its opening notes, its whisks listeners away. On the new album from the esteemed post-classical pianist, Blais is in perpetual bloom, moved by life's beauty and nature's song.     Sometimes softly, sometimes momentously, this bloom bears a distinct shift in sound. The Montreal-born musician signed to Arts & Crafts for his 2016  debut LP  Il  for solo piano. 2018's  Dans ma main   found him exploring new territory, combining electronics with classical and a darker motif. The latter was inspired by a section of a poem by an obscure French-Canadian Quebec poet who couldn't live the life he wanted, and was suffering because of it. That feeling permeated  Dans ma main .    With  aubades , Blais continues his penchant for pulling concepts into his music, and even though the new album was composed at times when he was going through his own challenges, it was also an inspired and productive period, and it's felt in its major tonalities and remarkable vitality.     The record's title refers to a Middle Ages dawn serenade about lovers separating at daybreak, and the music lives in this bittersweet goodbye, with the ache and hope of new days, the thrills and fears of uncertainty. Blais still hints at his varied influences, and he collaborated with Alex Weston (a former Philip Glass assistant) while composing the collection, but its distinctive quality comes from his finding inspiration in Renaissance and Middle Ages musical textures — those built for wide-ranging, emotive storytelling — as well as designer, poet and activist William Morris' social-democratic artistic ethic.    Morris' design style seems to have influenced the ornate cover art of  aubades , and what's pictured, along with the aforementioned inspirations, translate into life-affirming compositions, kept dynamic and gripping through Blais' keen technical and melodic pop sensibilities. More than anything else, he continues to push his capabilities and what modern classical music can be while bringing a fresh take on old stories, styles, and serenades.  aubades  also marks Blais' first foray into writing for an ensemble – a 12-person one – and he's clearly been doing his homework.     Instruments were recorded close to the microphones, so not only are their timbres expressive and resonant, but intimate sounds, like the whoosh of a foot pedal, creaks and snaps, conversational fragments and laughter, give the quality of being in the room, feeling the energy come to life, lift off and away. Opening track ""murmures,"" Blais' tribute to Philip Glass, unfolds with arpeggiating keys before being joined by gentle, wistful strings and woodwinds. Flutes eventually enter, uniting in the song's sway, and by its end, the instruments' wavering rhythms and melodies have grown so wonderfully hypnotic and entwined they'll be dancing through heads for days.     In ""passepied,"" a gang of playfully bobbing strings and woodwinds gains boisterous momentum before dropping away to a heady piano sprawl that's soon accompanied by weeping violins and horn flares. The troupe transitions into a reprise with the chipper ensemble singing its heart out, and the melancholic melody harmonizing through the song's latter part showcases remarkable strength with this ability while layering it against a jubilant backdrop. ""nina"" winds through sorrowful tones and odd cadences set in a wondrous, mesmerizing swing, while the staccato blasts and rapid-fire rhythms of ""yanni"" veer towards maximal minimalism.    Then there's the soothing ""if you build it, they will come,"" moving elegantly in lustrous, sweeping measures with flitting plucks, pensive strings and double bass. Blais is skillful and intentional in giving each instrument time to shine, and the collection benefits from this democratic ethos. ""ouessant"" has the vivid, brooding and building high drama of a symphony, while ""flâneur,"" ""carrousel"" and closer ""doux"" find courage in reflective restraint, drawing hope from woes and a community of sympathetic sounds.     During  aubades ' gestation, Blais would go for runs or cycle while listening to its demos, and was moved by the natural world around him. Like Blais sitting in soft light at his piano on  Il , and the fragments of the ways the poet's life could have gone, held delicately in a broken crystalline heart, yet still shining, on  Dans ma main ,  aubades  blossoms like its comforting, colourful, captivating cover, full of lush greens, blues, oranges, yellows, fluttering butterflies and unfolding lives. It's a rebirth to behold.

2021-12-08,Jordan Currie,7,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Beatrice Deer's 'SHIFTING' Is a Multilingual Merger of Darkness and Light,,"Montreal-based singer-songwriter  Beatrice Deer  understands how to merge opposite worlds to birth a fresh, inventive new one. A blend of modern folk tales with traditional Inuit ones serves as a landscape for her music, where the sounds of classic indie pop and rock are interwoven with Inuit throat singing. On top of this, the half-Inuk, half-Mohawk artist also sings in three languages: English, French and  Inuktitut, at times switching between multiple within one song.  Her approach to bringing these elements together is skillful and graceful on her sixth studio album  SHIFTING , where she explores the emotions surrounding getting older and moving on to another phase of life.     On paper,  SHIFTING  may sound daunting and overly complicated for those who only speak one language, but Deer's ability to craft a seamless flow between her songs and highlight universal themes of transformation and growth can lead any listener to enjoy the journey.  ""Emotionally, spiritually, and physically, the transition towards our authentic selves continues,""  she shared of the album . ""As I shift into the position where I'm meant to be, I want to keep using what I've learned to help others.""      Sonically and thematically, there's a duality to  SHIFTING  that is established early on — part indie rock/pop with harder, experimental elements peppered in, and part tender and docile, like a collection of lullabies. The opening song ""FREE"" is crystal clear and clean, celebrating  being ready to move on from something or someone. What follows is ""UQAUTINNGA,"" a stark contrast with its distorted rock guitar riffs interweaving through a steady percussion, and the sinister and murky ""AANNGIQ,"" where Deer's throat singing lurks in the background, and the chant-like, one-note melody provides a simple slate for interesting textures to play off of. At times, the throat singing even becomes percussion itself, blending into the mix on the edgy, drum-heavy ""SUNAUVVA.""    The aptly named ""ILINUTT - a prayer"" is spiritual and folky, hushed and slow in its presentation and taking its time to open up, like a flower blossoming. On ""HISTORY,"" Deer encourages listeners to let go of whatever is holding them back and proceed towards a brighter future. ""Time to trust yourself, you have to trust yourself"" and ""Leave the past behind, leave the pain behind"" she sings atop reverberating guitars and a bass line that slips around. The closing ""ACCORDION SONG"" is simply that: a minute-long accordion instrumental that sounds more like an interlude than an album finale. It's a somewhat lacklustre ending after the array of intricate sounds thus far, and the penultimate ""CHRISTMAS"" acts more like an 11 o'clock number.      Still,  SHIFTING  is an eclectic, enchanting project that pulls off morphing into different, contrasting sounds while remaining entirely cohesive in execution. It's an album that is as dark and avant-garde as it is light and playful, just like the life that Deer depicts in her music.

2021-12-09, Joseph Leroux,7,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Teen Daze's 'Interior' Embraces the Power (and Production) of House Music ,,"Interior , the newest release from British Columbia's  Teen Daze , finds producer Jamison Isaak succeeding his signature realist ambiance with French house-inspired kicks and bitcrushed samples. It's a danceable deep-dive into some of Isaak's first inspirations, and a demonstration of his mastery of production methods both old-school and contemporary.      With this artistic expansion in mind,  Interior  still  retains the gentle palatability of previous Teen Daze releases.  A decade of globe-trotting and producing ""soft-focus synth pop and romantic electronica"" gradually revealed to Isaak what role Teen Daze plays in his life: ""dream fulfillment."" He describes  Interior  as ""an album of first loves refracted through prisms of wisdom, wounds, and wonder.""    These refractions are rarely more apparent than on lead single ""Swimming"", whose four on the floor beat and sidechained ambience is adorned with skittering electronic chirps. Another standout track , "" Nite Run""   pleasurably disorients the listener in a cloud of finger-tapping samples, until a kick bristling with late-evening energy punches proudly through the mix.      Interior  recalls Teen Daze's 2015 EP  A World Away,  which also draws upon European dance music for inspiration, juxtaposing wide-open synth pads and hopeful arpeggios against 909-reminiscent beats. To its merit,  Interior  feels immediately more robust and multidimensional than that aforementioned effort, showcasing Isaak's growing understanding of the legacy production methods behind iconic house tracks.     The production on  Interior  speaks to Isaak's fascination with the individual sounds that make up his music and the sense of cohesion they can lend. Field recordings of running water, the hiss of hi-hats and white noise, as well as delicate vocal processing unite these tracks with one another.  Joseph Shabason 's ethereal saxophone on album opener ""Last Time In This Place"" sets the stage for the funk-inspired lines on album closer ""Translation"".     While getting back in touch with some of his earliest inspirations may have brought out a more beat-forward side of Isaak's production,  Interior  actually expands upon the width and density indicative of earlier releases in the Teen Daze catalog.    On late-album interlude  ""Still Wandering"", delicious aliasing combs the ear amidst a sheen of vocals processed past intelligibility, before dropping into the  Cecile Believe -assisted  ""2AM (Real Love)."" As the only track on the record to unabashedly lead with its house music influence, this is when  Interior  really expands into that style's celebratory space. ""I feel it coming slowly / like a window gently opening"" sings Believe in a tone-bent undersing, dripping with the coolness of a hot dancefloor.  It is hard not to wish that this energy and sure-footedness had announced itself earlier.       Less about injecting four-on-the-floor dance rhythms into the Teen Daze sound or detouring through them,  Interior  highlights French house as one of the primary reasons for Isaak's transfiguration into Teen Daze, alluding to dance music's much celebrated power as catalyst for personal awakening. Reverse engineering the methods behind the iconic dance genre brings Teen Daze into focus.

2021-12-14,Wesley McLean,7,"ALBUM,HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Rick Ross Revels in His Signature Sound and Style on 'Richer Than I Ever Been',,"Rick Ross  has spent almost twenty years mastering not only his craft, but his character and sound. Album after album, Ross has expanded his catalogue without ever veering away from his signature recipe — instrumentals that feel luxurious, bars bloated with braggadocio, and a sprinkle of anecdotal tales from a drug dealer's diary. As the saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" and if  Richer Than I Ever Been  teaches us anything, it's that Rick Ross ain't broke, and his formula isn't either.     Richer Than I Ever Been  is another solid outing in Ross's catalogue. While it doesn't reach the heights of 2009's  Deeper Than Rap   or 2010's  Teflon Don ,  it shows that Ross hasn't forgotten what made those albums so endearing in the first place. Pair that with his unrivalled and always excellent ear for beats, and it becomes simple to see how Ross has found such comfort, and success, in his creative process.    Barring a few duds here and there, Ross again delivers songs that showcase the best of his abilities, and brings a few friends along for the ride. It's quite impressive that this deep into his career and catalogue, Ross can still pull out a showstopper of a drug rap track like the Benny the Butcher-assisted ""Rapper Estates."" The pair deliver immaculate verses over an extremely cinematic, lavish soundscape, laced with an infectious horn sample and some thudding 808s courtesy of Boi-1da.               The album's biggest highlight is the Bink!-produced ""Warm Words in a Cold World."" Outside of incredible guest spots from Wale and Future, it's a unique sonic entry in Ross's catalogue. On it, he takes an instrumental that sounds completely out of his wheelhouse and crafts a song that fits right into the world he has spent nearly two decades building, crafting standout moment that would easily be a highlight on any of his last few projects.                Richer Than I Ever Been 's tracklist also packs in archetypal Ross tracks, ranging from solid to very good, but there are places where Ross's loyalty to his sound becomes a detriment. In these moments, his reliance on his signature style comes off more as a reluctance to leave his comfort zone, or worse, a retread of something we've heard before.    For example, ""Marathon"" on its own is a pretty good track, but if you're a Ross fan, you've heard him rap over a similar instrumental on Mac Miller's  Faces  cut ""Insomniak,"" where his flow and cadence aren't all that different. Hearing it for the first time, the track comes off a tad uninspired, even if it's mostly due to the recycled sample.               Another moment on here that feels like a rehash of Ross's past work is the title track ""Richer Than I Ever Been,"" which feels like Ross either went into the studio with a checklist of Rossisms to use, or just fed his entire discography to an AI designed to generate its own Rick Ross song. Again, it isn't an inherently bad song, but on a short 12-song album, this one puts an end to an otherwise great stretch of songs from ""Warm Words in a Cold World"" to ""Imperial High.""    Still, these two rather lacklustre moments don't do much to derail how enjoyable this album is. While Ross's loyalty to his signature sound may lead to weaker moments on  Richer Than I Ever Been , it is this familiar foundation that his music is built on that has given him continued success throughout his career. This album won't change anyone's opinion of Rick Ross, but fans will get everything they love about his music: some standout tracks, an abundance of charismatic luxury raps and a slew of incredible, lavish instrumentals for you to cruise around to.

2022-01-04,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,9,"ALBUM,HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Nas Deepens His Legacy by Making 'Magic',,"On Christmas Eve, veteran Queens MC  Nas  dropped his  Magic  project to an unsuspecting audience. If the  Grammy win  and  nomination  for his first two  King's Disease  projects with producer  Hit-Boy  weren't enough to grab listeners' attention, this sublime collection of stellar songs certainly will. Nas spits ""I am 21 years past the 27 club"" on the grimy yet melodic opener ""Speechless,"" confirming his longevity in the game on an album where the themes are timeely but the flow is reminiscent of the Nasty Nas era.    The eternal JAY-Z-versus-Nas debate looms overhead as Nas announces "" KD3  on the way, this just to feed the buzz"" on the soulful ""Ugly."" Indeed, the superb chemistry he showcases with Hit Boy, combined with astute cross-generational social observations like ""Marvin Gaye to Young Dolph, we taking out our brothers,"" indicates that Nas has currently taken the edge over Hova in the Grown Man Rap category.     Magic  also comes with its share of certified bangers, such as the braggadocious ""Meet Joe Black,"" where Nas confidently repeats, ""Your top three, I am not number one, how could you post that?"" in the infectious hook. The song's outro skit alludes to Nasir Jones' infamous  Hip Hop Is Dead  claim, a statement the rapper has  recently amended . This is a symbolic moment on the record, as  Magic  proves the rapper's potency — not through press quotes or his legendary status, but via the music.    ""40-16 Building"" is chock-full of throwback sound effects from the early 2000s, while the bounce of ""The Truth"" brings back to the Nas Escobar persona of 1996's  It Was Written . However, this album is likely to be more unanimously accepted by fans, with tracks like the playful ""Wu for the Children"" taking listeners down memory lane as Nas insightfully reflects on his place in the rap world and broader society.    As the album progresses, the cliché of ""all killer, no filler"" rings true. ""Hollywood Gangsta"" directly addresses the New York drill movement and its tragic repercussions without becoming preachy. Similarly, when Nas teams up with iconic producer  DJ Premier  and fellow NYC rapper  A$AP Rocky  on ""Wave Gods,"" the chorus scratching and boom bap beat are never in danger of being corny. Instead, the track proves that Nas doesn't depend on Hit-Boy and can meld generations to concoct a standout song.     Magic  closes with the majestic ""Dedicated,"" as a sumptuous beat switch allows Nas to effortlessly change flows. This caps off an immaculate project that finds Nas regaining top form and will surely find its way close to the top of his illustrious discography, which is aging like fine wine.    Nas himself sums up the project in the chorus of ""Wu for the Children"": ""Special like my classics / Special like my listeners who have attachments / To my old style, won't let me pass it.""

2022-01-10,Wesley McLean,9,"POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",The Weeknd Cements His Status as an All-Time Great on 'Dawn FM',,"It's rare to be able to acknowledge the presence of an all-time great while they're still in their prime, but when an artist has made it as apparent as  the Weeknd  has, it becomes impossible to ignore. Toronto-born Abel Tesfaye has undoubtedly become one of the biggest names in music today, essentially living at the top of the charts since 2014. Impressively, he has maintained that position without ever allowing the success of one record to dictate the sound of the next. Instead of chasing continued success through familiarity, he has continually experimented with his music and constantly re-invented and pushed the boundaries of his sound with every release, a trend that continues with his latest,  Dawn FM .    This project is easily the most conceptually sound, concise and cohesive Weeknd project to date, but not at the expense of variety.  Dawn FM  is an extremely ambitious body of work, fusing elements from R&B, hip-hop, disco, new wave, electropop and synthpop to create a unique and ethereal soundscape that somehow manages to feel incredibly futuristic while being drenched in '80s nostalgia. The result is a musical backdrop that helps to score the album's complex narrative in an endearing and enchanting manner that perfectly fits its concept, helping to enhance it even further.     Dawn FM  plays as a fictional radio show on a station of the same name, hosted by none other than  Jim Carrey , who guides the listener through purgatory, aiding them as they patiently wait to make their transition and ""step into the light."" Carrey is perfect in this role, as his spoken-word interludes all exude a certain celestial quality that, in conjunction with the sublimely produced soundscape, evokes a truly transcendent feeling. It's an extremely well-executed and interesting concept, and it becomes even more so when one considers how this album, and its narrative, fit into the Weeknd's discography.     There have been common threads throughout all of Tesfaye's projects as the Weeknd, regardless of how different they've been from one another. Since the mixtape days, Tesfaye's music has often been characterized as nihilistic, telling tales of himself in disrepair, and the escape that he sought through drugs, sex and excess, leaving behind a path of destruction. While there are remnants of those themes on this LP, it's nowhere near as present, and this project also happens to be his most upbeat by far.  Dawn FM 's concept may, on the surface, be about transitioning into the afterlife, but it also seemingly plays as an allegory for Tesfaye's cathartic escape from the personal purgatory that he's held himself in for so long.    In a catalogue that is filled with so many moments of self-destruction and sorrow, it's refreshing to hear a lighter and more upbeat approach to the music while Carrey delivers lines like ""Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed / Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame."" One can't help but see how the concept, while applicable to any listener, applies directly to Tesfaye. There's a feeling of clarity here that just wasn't present on past Weeknd projects, as if a fog has been lifted, revealing an artist who is not just at his very best but at a personal turning point as well.     Whereas much of his music up to this point has been rife with tales of debauchery and drug abuse, with Tesfaye displaying a nonchalant disregard for his own life and the damage left in his wake, he approaches  Dawn FM  with a more thoughtful, remorseful tone. He is no longer the drug-addled Casanova he once presented himself as, and he's no longer living a life with reckless abandon for his own wellbeing as well as the emotional wellbeing of any woman who crosses his path. This is a person learning from their past and wanting to be free of their guilt and shame, a person who is looking inward, recognizing their faults, and attempting to grow into someone better.     This feeling is communicated throughout most of the album, but it's at its most potent on its standout tracks. On ""Out of Time,"" a sparkling, smooth '80s R&B-inspired track, sees Tesfaye acknowledging the error in his ways (""The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby / There's so much trauma in my life / I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby / I look back now and I realize"") and pining for another chance. Meanwhile, ""Less Than Zero"" is an admission of the immense guilt he feels for his actions in a past relationship, and the shame he feels knowing that his former partner now sees him as ""less than zero."" Moments like are a far cry from earlier hits like ""Wicked Games"" and ""The Hills,"" which depicted the artist as a heartless sadist fixated on substance-fuelled flings free of commitment.    It's for these reasons that  Dawn FM  feels like a truly pivotal moment in the Weeknd's already illustrious career. It's a brilliant new benchmark in his already stellar discography, showcasing just how much of an artistic powerhouse he has become and a clear shift from the darkness that his music, even at its poppiest, once embodied. The growth Tesfaye has demonstrated not even two years after the excellence of  After Hours  leaves the realm of possibilities for his future release endless. With  Dawn FM , Abel Tesfaye has truly cemented himself as one of the modern greats, and it's been a treat to be able to experience it in real-time.

2022-01-12,Michael Di Gennaro,7,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Gunna Is Best When He Stays in His Lane on 'DS4EVER',,"Like any emerging rap artist from the South,  Gunna 's emergence into the hip-hop consciousness in the late 2010s was met with a number of comparisons. For some, he sounded too much like the man who signed him, Young Thug; others had trouble distinguishing him from partner-in-crime Lil Baby when they rapped together. In reality, Gunna never really sounded like either: he's much too relaxed to be confused with the eccentric Thug, and Baby's rugged intensity is more of a contrast to his signature laid-back nature than a similarity. The best parallel to Gunna isn't even one of his contemporaries or a Southern rapper at all; it's Mase. It all checks out: they both emphasize opulence and indulgence in their music, wear equally ridiculous outfits, and worry less about being the hardest or best MC and more about being the flyest one.    If the finely aged, criminally underrated  Harlem World  epitomized exactly what Mase was about, then 2018's  Drip Season 3  did the same for Gunna. Both wielded multiple strong singles (""What You Want,"" ""Lookin at Me"" and ""Feel So Good"" for the former, ""Oh Okay"" and ""Top Off"" for the latter) and are shockingly consistent in their message that yes, they are richer than you and yes, your girlfriend knows it. Yet where Mase struggled post- Harlem World , eventually choosing an early retirement in 1999, Gunna's career has grown significantly. His post- DS3  career has only seen him grow in popularity, morphing his signature sound to fit an aquatic theme on 2019's  Drip or Drown 2   and a tropical aesthetic on 2020's  WUNNA . His music, at its best, is heavily addictive, and resembles the auditory version of a viral ""satisfying video"" compilation. His ability to find the perfect pocket on production from Wheezy, Taurus or Turbo has become second nature, and his flows are so smooth and carry so much forward momentum that it feels less like rapping and more like watching a perfectly-executed figure skating routine.     DS4EVER , Gunna's latest effort, is a departure from the singular moods of  Drip or Drown 2  and  WUNNA . Whether for streaming optimization reasons or a desire to mix things up, Gunna experiments more than ever, throwing in a few R&B cuts and some Rod Wave-esque ""pain"" songs. The experiments are mostly hit-or-miss; where some, like the Keith Sweat-sampling ""livin wild"" and closer ""so far head > empire"" succeed at shedding a more personal light into the rapper's life, the R&B collaborations can come off as phoned-in, playlist fodder in order to cover all bases. Considering Gunna already has such a calm, laidback approach to making music, the possibility of inviting singers into his world could have yielded interesting results; instead, he awkwardly fits onto his own tracks, and ends up coming off as a featured artist on his own album.    The varied success of the songs that look to expand Gunna's palette are balanced out with a number of records that call back to the vibe of the previous  Drip Season  tapes, dominating the record's strong first half and keeping its backside afloat. Whether buttery smooth (""south to west"" ""flooded"") or dark and brooding (""pushin P"", ""idk that bitch""), they're displays of a master at work, someone who knows exactly the type of emotional reaction he wants to get from his audience and how to reach it.    He's also found organic chemistry with many of the rapping guests on the album, specifically  Young Thug ,  Future  and  Kodak Black . Unlike the singers on the record, he plays off them perfectly, often going back-and-forth with his guest and elevating them along the way. These are the moments on  DS4EVER  that remind you why Gunna has become so popular; he's able to lend some of his borderline-unreasonable confidence into his audience and his guests. The high points of  DS4EVER  provide escapism in its most enjoyable form: it doesn't matter where you are in life; when you hear a song like ""poochie gown"", with its pummeling  Metro Boomin  beat and its unrelenting bravado, you're young, rich, and sought-after.      DS4EVER  is certainly a good mainstream rap record, and fans of Gunna and the community of high-profile Atlanta artists he's aligned with will find plenty to enjoy across the album's 19 tracks. Still, the question of where he goes from here is left for listeners to wonder. The attempts at diversifying his sound go over decent at best, and while he's mastered his specific lane of luxury rap, the time will come when it either becomes dated or his fanbase simply loses interest. It would be foolish to totally count out someone who was able to forge a distinct sonic identity in what is possibly music's most saturated genre, and it's exciting to see Gunna actively looking for new ways to innovate on his signature sound even if they didn't come out perfect this time around. With the  Drip Season  era coming to a close with  DS4EVER 's release, here's to hoping the next chapter of Gunna's career is just as addicting as the first.

2022-01-12,Max Heilman,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Chastity Plumbs the Passion of Emo on 'Suffer Summer',,"The genius of  Chastity 's 2018 debut  Death Lust  manifests in the many roads it opened for the project's mastermind Brandon Williams.  Death Lust  brought together everything from Deftones and Helmet, to the Smashing Pumpkins and Hum, allowing 2019's  Home Made Satan  to favor haunting lyricism and jangly angst while grounding itself in a comparable stylistic nexus. Suffice to say,  Suffer Summer  preserves key tenets of this nexus, this time recalling the palatable hooks and passionate depth of '90s and 2000s emo.     It's telling that Williams released ""Pummeling"" as a single, considering he had second thoughts about dropping a song so cut-and-dry. The song's simple, infectious riffs and ear-worm melodies immediately set a distinct tone from Chastity's darker, moodier past. Indeed, comparisons to classic emo run deeper than Williams collaborating with Alexisonfire's Dallas Green on ""Vicious Circle."" Complete with swelling string accompaniment, this surprisingly lush ballad solidifies  Suffer Summer  as an unapologetically pleasant iteration of Chastity's sound.     So pleasant, in fact, that processing the despondent pep talk within ""Real World"" might require reading the lyrics without listening to Williams' singing: ""I think I'd rather suffer / I always feel worse / before I feel better.""  Suffer Summer 's road-weary grappling with happiness (or a longing thereof), gives the lovesick ""When You Go Home I Withdrawal"" a uniquely endearing melancholy: ""Kept the door unlocked / So you could get right back in."" Co-written by PUP frontman and friend of the band Stefan Babcock, both these tracks deliver exhilarating syncopation and anthemic sheen with respective splendour.     Deeper cuts help clarify why Deathwish Inc., of all labels, released  Suffer Summer  internationally. Regardless of the extreme music Deathwish usually caters to, it's no easy feat to dismiss Chastity's tenacious choruses and dynamic nuances because ""it's not angry enough."" Whether it's the chest-pumping grit of the riff-tastic ""Overstimulate,"" or the buoyant gloss and climatic peaks of ""The Barbed Wire Fence Around Happiness,"" Williams extracts convincing intensity and memorable motifs from every end of  Suffer Summer 's sonic spectrum.     As a more streamlined affair,  Suffer Summer  greatly benefits from a bolstered production value. ""Dying To Live"" can hit harder with its mid-tempo bounce, but also elevate Williams' straightforward vocal leads with sweeping shifts to oscillated drum tones and glistening guitar ambiance — two aspects it shares with ""Somersault."" Based on a voice memo Dallas Green sent to Williams (aptly titled ""Pumpkins""), ""Somersault"" nods to the orchestral beauty of Smashing Pumpkins' ""Tonight, Tonight"" atop hypnotic, vigorous riffage. Blissful nihilism secures the song's place as an album highlight, hitting at the centre of pandemic dread: ""Stay in bed 'cause it's safe / I don't leave, it's doomsday.""      Suffer Summer 's emotional quotient hits critical mass with the deceptively energized ""Happy Face,"" dedicated to Williams' friend — a victim of fentanyl overdose. His memoir paints a heart-wrenching portrait of loss and addiction with his most passionate singing to date: ""Dopamine is hidden in a lot of deathly places / You're the part of me that's missing."" Williams encapsulates this balance of vulnerability and arresting melodies with final cut ""Smiling."" Its pristine, strummed acoustic guitar and placid groove brings  Suffer Summer  full circle, in pursuit of elusive hope in the midst of hardship.     From start to finish, there's enough gnarly distortion and explosive percussion to connect this album's most poppy arrangements to Chastity's raw inception. In this lies the overarching significance of  Suffer Summer  as Williams' third artistic metamorphosis. Williams offers a more accessible facet of his vision, but retains the fervent personality that first made Chastity one of Ontario rock's finest up-and-comers.

2022-01-13,Dylan Barnabe,9,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Bonobo's 'Fragments' Is an Inspiring Meld of Organic and Electronic,,"From the moment  Fragments  begins, you know you've arrived. Where is of little consequence — it's certainly not bearing of any physical location. Rather, it's a place of spiritual reflection and familiar reverie that British producer and DJ  Bonobo , a.k.a. Simon Green, has carefully refined for over two decades. From early days as a downtempo solo project to becoming a worldwide headliner and five-time Grammy nominee, Bonobo has become synonymous with some of today's best emotive dance music.      Fragments  is Green's seventh album and follows 2017's wildly successful  Migration .  Recorded over 2020 and 2021, the album took shape during periods of intense isolation and personal turbulence. Green sought solitude among nature to reignite his inspiration, reaching out to other artists like Miguel Atwood-Ferguson to add to the album's rich texture (see the string arrangement for opener ""Polyghost"").    The aptly named  Fragments  was born, featuring collaborations with Jordan Rakei, Jamila Woods, Joji, and Kadhja Bonet among others (a particular delight is the use of harpist Lara Somogyi's samples throughout). Oscillating seamlessly between downtempo and dance, Green's music continues to inspire introspection and contemplation among listeners. It's hard to imagine a world in which this latest release will not garner the same critical acclaim as its predecessor.     The most awe-inducing moment of  Fragments  arrives with ""Otomo,"" featuring O'Flynn. With little access to a real dancefloor, Green somehow manages to bottle the magic of a rave through its bass-heavy breakdown and pulsating energy. Most notably, the six-minute masterpiece samples a Bulgarian choir, elevating the dance track to anthemic proportions.    Similarly, ""Age of Phase,"" ""Rosewood"" and ""Closer"" hold dance floor potential, while ""From You,"" ""Tides"" and ""Day by Day"" elicit Bonobo's classic roots. In particular, Bonet's vocals on ""Day By Day,"" as well as the elegiac saxophone, are immediately reminiscent of Andreya Triana's liquid gold on 2010's  Black Sands .  It closes the album with the hopeful refrain, ""Inch by inch, day by day / We'll make this a better place."" In this way,  Fragments  charts the ebb and flow of our collective struggle and perseverance, choosing to end in optimism.        Though Green excels at the many production-heavy elements, such as stitching together the perfect loop or drum beat, he remains unchallenged when it comes to his ability to create organic sound that is at once full-bodied, warm, and filled with textures from around the world. Bonobo's growth, too, across the past two decades has seen a natural and consistent progression, each record building beautifully on the last.  Fragments  is no exception. It is an album to find love again; to reignite creativity; to regain hope; to find connection.

2022-01-14,Ian Gormely,6,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Moist Keep Their Legacy Afloat on 'End of the Ocean',,"The knock on so many Canadian '90s alt-rock bands was that they couldn't make it in the States. Try as they might, Our Lady Peace, Matthew Good, the Tea Party and their contemporaries could never quite convince Americans that their respective sonic flavours were needed in a country already drowning in Lives, Everclears and Collective Souls.     Popularity as a measurement of artistic success has always been dubious. But the dilemma these bands faced then is a useful prism through which to hear new work from any artist whose time in the pop-culture sun has dimmed. In an era when thousands of new songs are released every day, is this music for anyone beyond a core group of diehard fans?      Moist , the Vancouver-via-Montreal five-piece who lit up airwaves in the second half of the '90s with hits like ""Push"" and ""Resurrection"" (and happened to sell a million discs, mostly in Canada, in the process) certainly think so. Built on the broad theme of the emptiness of overconsumption,  End of the Ocean , their fifth album (second since reforming in 2013) threads this tricky needle of needing to please nostalgia hounds while still creating something of lasting merit.     Like its predecessor, 2014's  Glory Under Dangerous Skies , the album ditches the broader sonic palette introduced on  Mercedes Five and Dime  and singer David Usher's solo work in favour of a focus on the basics: guitar riffs and Usher's knack for impassioned vocal hooks. The band have always been a bit self-serious, but in the '90s, who wasn't? Usher remains a master of wringing drama from weighty subject matter. Bass player Jeff Pearce returned to the fold after sitting out the last few years to focus on family, and he lets his presence be known with rumbling bass lines that anchor ""Put the Devil on It"" and the title track, two of the record's standouts.     Guitarist Mark Makoway produced and mixed the record, nixing individual flashiness for a clean, cohesive sound. But at their best, Usher was a live wire, his voice exploding out of speakers while Makoway's guitars and Kevin Young's piano trills filled the space in between (""Silver"" showcased this dynamic to a tee). Things here are more compact, the songs more streamlined. Usher is reigned in and Young's keyboards can be hard to even pick out in the mix. It's a safe choice that nevertheless leaves things feeling a little anodyne.     ""Tarantino (Bullet Kill Sex Love Thrill)"" is probably the most Moist-esque song on the album, but the band are at their best when they're at their most unpredictable. The keys and vocals-driven ""High On It"" pulls the band outside their usual lane and is all the better for it.     Like so many of their '90s peers, Moist are a legacy act. Most of the fans popping their name into Spotify's search bar are looking for a hit of the past. Moist (one has to assume) know this.  End of the Ocean  deftly scratches that itch while pushing things forward, just enough to keep things interesting. It's what you want, it's what you need, it's what you wanted [them] to be.

2022-01-17,Noah Ciubotaru,8,"MARCH 2022 ISSUE,FROM THE MAGAZINE,ALBUM,MIXTAPE,REVIEWS,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",FKA twigs' High-Concept Approach Elevates the Mixtape on 'CAPRISONGS',,"FKA twigs  has been known to fashion herself into an art object. She was the focus of protracted closeups in her earliest music videos, calling upon the viewer to contemplate patiently and carefully. The simmering intensity of the visuals mirrored the music: languorous vocals that could swell and shatter along with daring electronic arrangements, an ecstatic seesaw of tension and release.    For her 2019 masterpiece,  Magdalene , twigs ditched the aesthetic that initially rendered her a sort of digital avatar and, instead, framed herself as a classical painting. That album's cover depicts her from the shoulders up, possessing hints of surreal features, and in an accompanying piece, brushstrokes seem to be layered over a full-bodied statue, one that's inflated with mountainous muscles. The similarly warped proportions of Ancient Greek sculpture connoted self-mastery and trained athleticism, virtues apparent in FKA twigs' history of retreating and returning with new skills. The  Magdalene  era began with the release of the stunning  ""cellophane,""  complemented by an equally stunning video in which twigs revealed that she had conquered the art of pole dancing. The next trick up her sleeve was a sword, brandished in the  ""sad day""  video as well as onstage during live performances, after her penchant for astounding feats of discipline led her to wushu.    In the eyes of an artist drawn to high concept and self-imposed constraints, the open terrain of the mixtape could present itself as another hill to climb. How might FKA twigs put down her sword and surrender to the informality of this medium?    In terms of approach, a distinction could be noted within the first 10 seconds of  CAPRISONGS ' opening track, ""ride the dragon."" In the gentle coo of her speaking voice, twigs addresses the listener, telling them that she made a mixtape for them, as if extending a tangible object into a distinct pair of hands. This barrier had never been broken down in her work; it was crucial to the construction of FKA twigs that whatever whittling occurred to arrive at something new and pristine remained invisible to the audience. But this time, that process is on full display, unfolding in the music.     CAPRISONGS  is stitched together by recordings of twigs' friends, who are unveiled to be a significant force (if not the most significant) driving her latest transformation. At the outset of ""meta angel"" — the project's offering that most closely resembles the dazzling slow-burns twigs is known to expertly command — she confides in them that she aspires to be less timid, and is met with responses that both lift her up and lovingly make fun of her earnestness, a fitting introduction to a song about incinerating one's ego. Ironically, the empowering messages that enabled twigs to let loose and pursue the structureless endeavour of creating a mixtape ended up providing its unifying thread.    Like the presence of friends, openness to musical collaborators seems vital to the ethos of this project. To be about de-centering the self and invigorating our fading memory of what it feels like to gather, other people are needed, populating the mix if not the shared physical space of a studio, party or club. Principal collaborator and executive producer  El Guincho  excels at summoning the desired sensation with thrumming, sweating production that invites twigs to play with her punchiest delivery to date. She seizes the opportunity to talk her shit on ""honda,"" carving out rap cadences alongside  Pa Salieu , who contributes a perfect, pithy verse. Like ""honda,"" the tape's most consuming tracks (""ride the dragon,"" ""tears in the club,"" ""oh my love"") strike a balance between atmospheric and carnal, potently reflected in the moments when twigs stretches her lithe harmonies across an airy expanse before snapping back into the bounce of a beat.  Jorja Smith  and Unknown T assist in scattering biographical morsels across the melancholic UK drill of ""darjeeling,"" mapping out an ode to their hometowns and past selves.    ""pamplemousse"" and ""which way"" serve as the purest evidence of the freedom achieved on this mixtape. These experimental sketches are delightful in their rejection of seriousness. On the former, twigs skips around a skittering instrumental, simulating the tease of online thirsting before a fan interrupts with a request for twigs to release an official version of her leaked collaboration with Dua Lipa.  CAPRISONGS ' more frivolous wanderings are offset by twigs pausing elsewhere to confront herself. ""Did you give yourself away again?"" she asks on ""lightbeamers."" What might have led one to do so, or any related regret that might be lingering, is irrelevant here. ""Don't do it again"" is the simple reminder that reverberates after that question, like a mantra, as twigs slides between different registers, channeling a whole chorus of affirmations imparted by the people around her.

2022-01-18,Calum Slingerland,8,"HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Earl Sweatshirt's Resilience Is the Remedy on 'SICK!',,"Opening new album  SICK! ,  Earl Sweatshirt  exhibits a creative clarity his music has eschewed in recent years. On first track ""Old Friend"" — which sounds and feels like an account from one companion to another after time apart — wistful strings from  the Alchemist  soundtrack rhymes of filling a void with writing and busting open blunt wraps to fight pandemic cabin fever, maintaining ""strong spirit where the body couldn't get asylum,"" finding ""the middle in a bit of balance.""    This lucidity, seldom felt as strongly in the kaleidoscopic cacophony of 2018's  Some Rap Songs  and on the shadowy, spectral 2019 EP  Feet of Clay , is at the core of  SICK! , driving momentum for Earl's navigation of present-day pitfalls, viral or otherwise. While the artist ended up scrapping a 19-song project with ""a really optimistic energy,"" as mentioned in  a recent  Rolling Stone  interview, in favour of  SICK! , he still leads with encouragement, rapping on ""2010,"" ""We got us a fire to rekindle / Redirect the fight where it's meant for / Triumph over plight and immense loss.""    Resilience, and an eye on a route forward, manifest even in the smallest observations of Earl's prose — pandemic uncertainties be damned. ""Keep changing for the better, what to do when your job thankless,"" he offers on ""God Laughs,"" knowing how even the best-laid plans can be sunk while ""swamp marching on, on the quest for my lost halo."" On ""2010,"" he also contends with the difficulty such decisions can evoke: ""Didn't look back when I broke soil / 'Cause every time I did it would hurt more."" On closer ""Fire in the Hole,"" led along by a cinematic guitar loop conjured by Black Noi$e, Earl affirms, ""It's no rewinding, for the umpteenth time, it's only forward.""    This juxtaposition is also explored in a sequencing sense, with the placement of the title track of  SICK!  back-to-back with the  ZelooperZ -assisted ""Vision."" The former sounds as if it were conceived in the thick of pandemic doldrums, with Earl seeking ""pleasure by the gram"" over dour, cascading keys, monotonously declaring ""Somethin' gotta give, cover me, I'm going in."" Soon enough, it backs into the vibrant, gleaming glissando of the latter, ZelooperZ ascending on the wings of his blissed-out bars before Earl picks himself up: ""Couldn't belittle myself / Couldn't be all weak-as-hell.""    However, that mindset at its most striking on ""Tabula Rasa,"" the project's centrepiece, on which Earl and  Armand Hammer  (the duo of  Billy Woods  and Elucid) saddle up to stumbling piano-bar production and pour out clever, affecting verses. Elucid's stoned reflection and Woods's recollection of a night out eventually leave their host to throw caution to the wind: ""You only trash if you trash, I keep it simple and dynamic / Trust the passage rites to life's chapters / I have to write to find balance / This game of telephone massive / I do what I have to with the fragments.""    What constitutes the ""end"" of the COVID-19 pandemic will differ among us, and with  SICK! , Earl Sweatshirt relays that the continued, hopeful push forward into the future — however long — will be all the more advantageous with one's best foot forward.

2021-11-12,Adam Feibel,4,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",'Crawler' Is the Sound of IDLES Running on Empty,,"Well, they've done it. Against all odds,  IDLES  have become… boring. What an unlikely feat! For a group of rowdy British punks who rose to prominence due to their rambunctiousness and politically targeted hooliganism — and whose most highly regarded album is earnestly titled  Joy as an Act of Resistance  — it seems impossible that they could make music that's listless, lethargic and half-hearted. Yet here we are.    IDLES' fourth album  Crawler  is a sludgy, murky mess; a sink full of dirty dishwater in which the band is perpetually circling the drain. On opener ""MTT 420 RR,"" it initially seems like they're building suspense; there are sparse guitars, ominous synths, and singer Joe Talbot holds his voice to a breathy croak, his syllables slithering in the empty spaces. But more than five minutes go by without that suspense amounting to anything. Eventually Talbot asks, ""Are you ready for the storm?"" And you've just got to wonder… what storm, exactly?    Whatever momentum the band has ,  they tend to squander it. On the post-punk shuffle of ""When the Lights Come On"" and ""The New Sensation,"" they aim for anthemic but meander too aimlessly to persuade anyone to sing along. ""Stockholm Syndrome"" is basically allergic to melody and rhythm. ""Crawl!"" is an overlong attempt at old-school punk, a style they already did much better on their 2020 effort  Ultra Mono .  ""Car Crash"" is a slog of industrial noise that shows only a loose grasp of what qualifies as a song. ""Progress"" sounds like an info dump of A. G. Cook's unused ideas; the harsh squawking of saxophones is the only respite from the monotony of ""Meds""; and ""Wizz"" is 30 seconds of blast beats, arhythmic hacking, and the sound of Talbot hollering in frustration as he tries to clear a stubborn gob of phlegm from his throat. They barely even muster the energy to end it with a bang. ""The End"" is there, and then it just… ends.    Even the album's strongest tracks feel like they're only 70% loaded, at best. With a soulful swing and the ring of a Hammond B3 organ, ""The Beachland Ballroom"" is like a punk take on Otis Redding. It's the record's most interesting song, and the most sensibly composed. Meanwhile, ""The Wheel"" takes the ol' shimmy 'n' shake of Chuck Berry-style rock 'n' roll and crosses it with Sunn O)))-style drone metal with downtuned guitars and guttural growls. These songs manage to succeed in spite of themselves, and only just barely.    One of the most notorious elements of IDLES' music has been Talbot's political stumping. He spent the band's first three albums snarling away at fascism, white supremacy, the patriarchy, the wealthy class and all manner of inequitably designed socioeconomic systems. Here, it's a lot harder to make out much of a clear message amid the madness. Even when Talbot calls out, ""Can I get a hallelujah?"" it isn't enthusiastic enough to be genuine, nor is it disinterested enough to be sarcastic. It just sounds like he's reading words on a page.    At 14 tracks and 47 minutes,  Crawler  is IDLES' longest album — and it really feels like it. It's actually pretty astonishing how little they manage to do in these songs. There are plenty of good ideas and somewhat convincing moments, but they're constantly letting the air out of their own tires. Throughout, there's this yawning gap where you'd normally find that palpable sense of an artist's love for their art.  Crawler  feels sad and empty… dispassionate and incomplete.    So what's to blame? Is it the result of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders that sapped the energy and vitality from so many people? Is it the influence of producer  Kenny Beats , whose style is perhaps better suited for the likes of Vince Staples, Denzel Curry and Freddie Gibbs? Did IDLES rush to follow up their last album and push a collection of half-cooked ideas out the door too quickly? However you try to explain it, it simply sounds like a band that's running out of gas. At least for now.

But even though  Silk Sonic 's cheeky lyrics and comedic delivery play like an  SNL  sketch,  Bruno Mars  and  Anderson .Paak  don't mess around on  An Evening with Silk Sonic . For those who have yet to return to in-person concerts,  An Evening  provides a formidable alternative: it's big, it's immersive, and, thanks to solid musicianship and impeccable cohesion, it evokes the feeling of a live set.     As solo performers, Mars and .Paak are both spunky and inherently commanding in their own right. But, refreshingly, when the two combine forces, they sharpen each other rather than overshadow, volleying vocals and quips with Olympian precision. Whatever camaraderie and mutual respect lives in their professional relationship underscores every song on the album — their chemistry is so airtight, it suggests the two once shared a womb.     Not one second on the album goes to waste. It's an efficient half-hour endeavour where every song, (save for the rousing intro), sounds like the grand finale of an epic live show. .Paak floats on ""Fly As Me,"" delivering breakneck rhymes that drip with show-stopping charisma. Mars polishes his charm and sings from his gut on the seductive ""After Last Night."" ""Smokin Out the Window,"" the inside joke that birthed this whole affair, showcases the pair's precise comedic timing and pulls laughs from the pit of the belly. And, as if the album didn't already have enough vigour, the pair knock their performance straight into the stratosphere with cosmic closer ""Blast Off.""  ""Skate,""  the album's summer single, is as weak as this project gets — its flaw is being a merely ""good"" song among great ones.     On production, Brooklyn phenom D'Mile joins Mars at the helm to create a warm, decadent bed of music dressed in '60s and '70s funk and soul. They shine in this capacity — where the lyrics on the album provide tongue-in-cheek comic relief, the production is where Silk Sonic establish themselves as a duo meant to be taken very seriously. The music spares no luxury; D'Mile spoils us with rich instrumentation throughout. Lavish cellos, twinkling vibraphones, spicy trumpets and spirited tambourines provide a feast for the ears; a welcome respite from the lethargic feel of computer-generated soundalikes. Every element — from the type of guitar picks the band used, to the legendary  Bootsy Collins  playing the role of master of ceremonies, to the vintage skins on .Paak's drums — is the result of excruciating attention to detail.  An Evening  cuts no corners in creating an authentic, retro sound.    But although it captures the feeling of a bygone era with such accuracy,  An Evening with Silk Sonic  still feels current and avoids sounding parodic. .Paak and Mars each contribute their own modern take on the music rather than trying to mimic greats of the past. They're expert method actors who provide less of an album and more of an experience.

2021-11-16,Luke Pearson,8,"POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",The Darkness Rev Up Their Humorous Rock on 'Motorheart',,"One sometimes gets the sneaking suspicion that North America has largely slept on British arena rockers  the Darkness . After being briefly catapulted into the spotlight in 2003 on the strength of singer Justin Hawkins's arresting falsetto in ""I Believe in A Thing Called Love,"" the band struggled to stick the landing with their sophomore album, 2005's undeniably weak  One Way Ticket to Hell… and Back .     Hawkins left the group shortly after, briefly formed the band Hot Leg (their one effort, 2009's  Red Light Fever , is a wholly decent lost Darkness album in everything but name), and for many, that was the end of it. Since regrouping in 2011, however, the group has released three totally worthwhile efforts (2012's comeback album  Hot Cakes  is the best of these), and one career masterpiece (2015's outstanding  Last of Our Kind ). 2021's  Motorheart  doesn't quite approach this achievement, but it's stronger than their last two efforts by a good margin, full of their usual humour and omnivorous rock acumen.    There really is a lot of silliness this time around. Queen-channeling lead single ""Motorheart"" is about a  Jetsons -esque love robot that gains sentience for instance, while ""Welcome Tae Glasgow"" is a goofy ode to the Scottish city featuring boisterous barroom accents (""Eastbound"" features a rattled-off itinerary of actual bars). Perhaps most bizarre however, is ""Jussy's Girl,"" which finds Hawkins applying the famous Rick Springfield refrain to his own situation for a fairly affecting lament of unrequited love. One's affection for this kind of goofiness may vary (a taste for  Monty Python  will likely help), but Hawkins's lyrics are never without creativity, and they're often endearingly un-hip and earnest as well, like he's a sort of glam rock Rivers Cuomo, or a more emo David Lee Roth.     The songs themselves are all largely excellent as well, with a particularly stacked second half. The dreamy harp and strings arrangement surging beneath the ringing chords of ""Sticky Situations"" is evidence that even the most florid and overwrought elements of the power ballads of yore can still sound fresh and authentic when treated with respect (and restraint). It would be remiss not to mention album closer ""Speed of Nite Time,"" a sunglasses-at-night banger that cruises the synthier side of the '80s to an extent the band has never done before. Indeed, they have a real knack for extracting some of the cheesier sonic touchstones from the rock of the '70s and '80s, refashioning them to refract their influences at angles that are new, yet still familiar — and often highly creative. It's the kind of joyful irreverence that sets them apart from the common run of trad-rock bands that venerate instead of celebrate their source material.     Some clichés are easier to rescue than others however, and there are definitely a couple of rock commonplaces on  Motorheart  that could be retired. For instance, do we really still need to be hearing those drawn-out, one-note finales where a band starts slow and then gets really fast, ending in frenzied noise? Recording beat-perfect versions of what should arguably be a spontaneous performative impulse seems like the kind of dusty, display-case energy the Darkness usually avoids so expertly. With the wheat comes the chaff perhaps, and if these superfluous histrionics are the necessary price of the whole, then it's easily paid — and at a tight nine tracks, any fat that needs trimming from  Motorheart  is easily digested. This one runs smooth.

2021-11-17,Chris Ayers,8,"METAL AND HARDCORE,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Dream Unending's 'Tide Turns Eternal' Dives into Death and Doom Metal,,"Toronto death metal sadists  Tomb Mold  buried the competition with their 2019 full-length  Planetary Clairvoyance , which, amid the smothering chaos, contained a curious ambient track titled ""Phosphorene Ultimate."" Its droning tones and disembodied whispers sounded more like a moody intro than a standalone song. Guitarist Derrick Vella captures this aura for maximum use in his new side project,  Dream Unending , alongside  Innumerable Forms  vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Justin DeTore.     Vella and DeTore play in such perfect lockstep with each other that one would never know that their debut album,  Tide Turns Eternal , was recorded in different countries: Vella in Toronto, DeTore in Boston. Such is the modus operandi for these seasoned metal musicians, who waste no time getting knee-deep in the doom with moody album opener ""Entrance."" Aside from this track, and the brief instrumental ""Forgotten Farewell,"" the remaining songs clock in at eight minutes long. The first slab, ""Adorned in Lies,"" resembles classic Mindrot in slo-mo, with fluid chord progressions and Vella's melodic soloing.     ""In Cipher I Weep"" is awash with church organs, anguished transitions, and Thergothon-esque creeping doom, while the glistening chords of ""The Needful"" resemble an  Animals -era Pink Floyd scoring a particularly tristful film soundtrack. Like Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath, the band named a song after themselves: the eleven-minute ""Dream Unending"" drags out crippling doom with increasing tempos before taking an immense draught of Tiamat's  Wildhoney  infused with echoing voice samples, and DeTore's deeply resonating gurgles create a layer of forlorn atmosphere throughout.     To cap the proceedings, the near-ten-minute title track navigates through gossamer, late-career Anathema chords before heaving the death/doom hammer down for six minutes; lithe female vocals rise from the mist, drawing influences from Novembers Doom and My Dying Bride. Co-produced and mixed by Arthur Rizk (Power Trip, Crypt Sermon, Cavalera Conspiracy),  Tide Turns Eternal  is funeral doom for Pallbearer fans, but more cerebral for Mortiferum acolytes.

2021-11-22,Kyle Mullin,9,"DECEMBER 2021 / JANUARY 2022 ISSUE,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Adele Pushes Her Songcraft to Even Grander Heights on '30',,"Six years after the release of her  record-breaking success   25 , British pop chart-topper  Adele  has returned with  30 , taking bigger risks and revealing enough hard truths to make this her most powerful album yet.    After  filing for divorce in 2019 , nurturing her now-nine-year-old son all the while, Adele has had no shortage of material to mine for  30 . But background context and lyrical catharsis aside,  30  is essential listening on a sonic level alone. Adele assuredly pushes her sound forward with a number of powerhouse producers, nimbly keeping pace with the skipping jazzy instrumental and lofty background vocals of ""Cry Your Heart Out,"" all of which are more reminiscent of an Erykah Badu or Janelle Monáe deep cut than anything from Adele's back catalogue (though the lyrics about wiping away tears are in-keeping with her material from  21  and  25 ). ""Oh My God,"" meanwhile, boasts understated stomping percussion for which Adele adopts a spellbinding staccato cadence. And the kitchen-sink production of ""Can I Get It"" features acoustic guitar breakdowns, slickly produced drum loops, blaring whistles and horns, and more, all of which Adele anchors with swaggering singing.    Adele's vocal prowess is matched by her ear for on-point production throughout  30 . Those collaborators include  25  alumni like Greg Kurstin (who co-wrote that album's chart-topper ""Hello""),  Tobias Jesso Jr.  (the British Columbia-born songwriter who co-wrote ""When We Were Young""), Max Martin (the ace behind some of Britney Spears' and the Backstreet Boys' biggest hits) and Shellback (who worked with Martin on hits by Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande). She has also recruited new collaborators like Swedish producer and composer  Ludwig Göransson  and, more interesting still, Inflo of the mysterious and critically acclaimed English band  SAULT . Martin and Shellback certainly throw every sonic trick in the book at ""Can I Get It,"" and Adele gamely rises to the occasion. No one would blame Kurstin, meanwhile, for resting on the laurels of the ubiquitous ""Hello,"" but he instead stays laudably hungry with eclectic production on ""Oh My God"" and ""Cry Your Heart Out.""     Yes, Adele and company have certainly made musical strides on  30 . But the singer's thematic growth is equally thrilling. Prime examples: ""Woman Like Me,"" a kiss-off for the ages to a lazy deadbeat, and the tender ode to motherhood ""My Little Love."" The lyrics of both those richly mature tracks would have shocked the lovesick Adele of the smash hit ""Someone Like You"" a decade ago, also heartening her because of just how far she's come along. It all comes together on standout ""I Drink Wine,"" where Adele captivatingly escalates her voice on the chorus, while lyrics like ""everybody wants somethin', you just want me"" succinctly convey the isolation of her singular success.     And yet, fans of Adele's back catalogue (who, of course, amount to many millions) will relish the acoustic guitar and gentle percussion of ""Woman Like Me,"" which echoes the spareness of ""Best for Last"" from her 2008 debut  19 . Meanwhile, the pained piano and high-note singing on both ""Hold On"" and ""To Be Loved"" will give listeners chills à la ""Someone Like You."" Indeed, Adele has deepened the niches that made her preceding songs so powerful. But instead of playing it safe with only those established tricks, her bold exploration of new terrain on ""Cry Your Heart Out"" and ""Oh My God"" help Adele become not only the world's top hitmaker but also a pop music visionary.

2021-11-23,Veracia Ankrah,7,"MIXTAPE,HIP-HOP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Haviah Mighty Is a Hot Commodity on 'Stock Exchange' Mixtape,,"When  Haviah Mighty  received the Polaris Music Prize in 2019 for her album  13th Floor , she became the first-ever rapper to claim the title. The 28-year-old from Brampton, ON, has yet to properly break out from the underground, but on her latest mixtape,  Stock Exchange , she isn't entirely concerned with proving her dominance as much as she is her artistry.    The mixtape is all politics and growing pains; over 12 songs, she attempts to make sense of a global pandemic, unemployment and a racial reckoning. But the general concept is no concept. ""I just wanted to release a bunch of dope singles without the expectation for it to be deep on any level,"" Mighty said in a press release accompanying the project.     Stock Exchange  is inspired by both the sound and political messaging of reggae. Songs like  ""Obeah""  and  ""Protest,""  featuring UK grime artist Yizzy — where Mighty refers to police in patois as ""bwoy dem"" — reflect her Jamaican roots, and the reggaetón-inspired ""Flamenco"" with the help of Mala Rodriguez.     As a curator, Mighty lends the spotlight to guests based on their strengths. But even in collaboration, she maintains a DIY approach: ""DIY, I learn it if I know I'm not equip,"" she raps on  ""Antisocial,""  featuring Old Man Saxon. ""This that Imma do it on my motherfuckin' lonesome.'"" She relishes self-sufficiency on ""Good On My Own Tonight,"" too, featuring fellow Bramptonian  TOBi . You can hear her desire to deemphasize sales and commercial success on songs like the summery ""Avocado.""    The music videos for  Stock Exchange  thus far are as vibrant as the project's lyrical imagery. In the video for  ""Tesla,""  one of the mixtape's biggest standouts, Mighty wreaks havoc through Toronto with the ferocity of a  Mario Kart  racer, picking up items that aid in her symbolic level-up. In the ""Obeah"" video, Mighty is set up by one of her friends after suspecting betrayal from another.    With the dozen tracks from  Stock Exchange  having been released on a monthly basis since dropping mixtape opener  ""Atlantic""  last November,  Stock Exchange  does what it was intended to — push back on the way music is manufactured, quickly consumed and has its worth determined by streaming metrics. There is something for every hip-hop lover as if to echo the recent push for everyone to invest in stocks, yet Mighty is not interested in selling her soul to the market.

2021-11-24,Antoine-Samuel Mauffette Alavo,8,"EP,REVIEWS,ALBUM,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,MUSIC",Kaytranada Isn't 'Intimidated' When Pushing the Boundaries of His Sound,,"Kaytranada 's career arc has been characterized by a constant evolution in sound and scope that somehow continues to solidify his core signature style. If the lengthy break between breakout debut  99.9%  and its  Grammy-winning  follow-up  Bubba  was certainly worth the wait, eager fans could always get some sonic satisfaction from random Soundcloud drops. Kaytra's new EP,  Intimidated , will help to tide fans over, and although it contains only three tracks, the variety of moods and strength of its features edge it to the same level of excellence as its aforementioned predecessors.    After a sublime collaboration on this year's ""Bloody Waters,"" groove master  Thundercat  and vocalist  H.E.R.  each reunite with Kaytranada and are afforded individual space to freely express their creativity.    H.E.R. appears on title track ""Intimidated,"" which features some familiar claps overtop of a derivative piano loop that is brought together by the singer's soaring yet soothing voice. Continuing in this contrasting fashion is the Thundercat-featuring ""Be Careful,"" where Kaytra provides a melodic background that is closest to what his fans have come to know him for. However, Thundercat's approach to attacking the song is quite surprising, as his playful lyrics and falsetto tone replace what would have been a famous R&B singer's role in one of Kaytranada's early career defining remixes. Even within the confines of such a short project, Kaytra is exploring new ground.    Those who knew him as  Kaytradamus  remember a more hip-hop focused producer who often blessed local rappers of Haitian descent with remixes and production. ""$payforhaiti."" the unexpected collaboration with  Mach-Hommy , is a return to Kaytra's roots in more ways than one. The fast paced rhythmic structure is matched by a controlled rapid-fire delivery in Kreyol from the usually mellow Hommy. This refreshing effort allows both artists to come together in harmonious and hard-hitting fashion.     Intimidated  finds Kaytra continuing to push the boundaries of his sound while never losing the essence of it. As an artist known for his singular processes and hand-picked collaborators, this EP surprisingly contains the highest profile guests of Kaytra's career. The project will not only satiate fans until the next album, but will also raise curiosity about where he might take his sound next.

2021-11-23,Daniel Sylvester,8,"REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,MUSIC","Julie Doiron Sounds Revitalized on Brash, Energetic 'I Thought of You'",,"Anyone familiar with  Julie Doiron 's work ethic knows that, just because she hasn't put out a proper album in a moon's age, doesn't mean she hasn't been busy. Since her last full-length, 2012's  So Many Days , the Moncton singer/songwriter founded  a couple of supergroups , recorded  another album with Mount Eerie , and  re-recorded some of her material in Spanish .    Maybe this is why her ninth solo LP,  I Thought of You , finds the three-decade vet sounding wonderfully revitalized and well-worn. Compiled from songs Doiron wrote across the last decade (including several previously released numbers), these 13 songs meld several eras throughout her career, both musically and emotionally. Tracks like ""Thought of You"" (from her  Greville Tapes  EP in 2016 with Nancy Pants) and ""How Can We Keep Laughing"" stand out due to Doiron's ability to deliver heart-wrenching lyrics overtop crashing instrumentation — courtesy of her starkly plucked playing and a rough-edged backing band that includes Dany Placard on bass alongside brothers Ian and  Daniel Romano  on drums and guitar, respectively. Opening number ""You Gave Me the Key"" conjures up Neil Young & Crazy Horse's dusty vulnerability, while the sweet, angular re-recording of 2019's ""Run"" is floated by Doiron's stop-start melodies and echoed guitars.    Once you begin to compare her re-recorded tracks with the originals, it become clear just how stimulating and energetic Julie and her band sound on her latest LP. This is best demonstrated by how the docile and sparse acoustic number ""Cancel the Party"" (originally from a 2003 split single with Okkervil River) is transformed into a thumping, brash rocker, while ""Good Reason"" (also from  Greville Tapes ) gets a paisley underground redux, complete with aching slide guitars.    Doiron's newly written tracks included here are just as sonically absorbing, as the vibrating, jammy ""Just When I Thought"" allows listeners to virtually feel the atmosphere of the room it was recorded in. But when Doiron wants to convey a certain emotional and lyrical gravity that defined albums like 2001's  Désormais  and 2002's  Heart and Crime , she's able to push her vulnerable and tender voice to the front, as demonstrated by the melodic ""How Can We"" and the prairie-ready on ""Darkness to Light.""    On  I Thought of You , Julie Doiron defends her crown as indie rock royalty, giving listeners yet another full-band classic that equals her material with the Wooden Stars and even Eric's Trip.

Following similar influences as their debut record,  Lower Than Love  sees a matured hardcore band tackle topics of depression, loss and heartbreak. While the subject matter remains similar to their debut, the manner with which these ideas are executed are more heartfelt and honest than ever.  Lower than Love  is an ode to the emotions that accompany loss, and everything else that comes with it.    Even though  Lower Than Love  is a bit of a sonic departure for the band, there are still plenty of riffs that will satisfy older fans.""Life as a 9-5"" plays out as a tribute to the Chariot, as the whole things revolves around one breakdown being reimagined. Heaviness is also achieved in other manners: ""Déjà Vu"" features some of the beefiest bass lines in Botfly's catalogue, while ""Reflect//Reject"" is stuffed with ascending riffs.    The album's highlight, riff-wise, is ""Cowards,"" which starts out with some of Botfly's most technical guitar work and then dissolves into a Bison-inspired ""Fear Cave"" breakdown at the end. When it comes to heavy moments on the album, Botfly have assembled  Lower Than Love  around these riffs for the ultimate cathartic response.    But even more than the heavy riffs, the best part of  Lower Than Love  is how Botfly embrace quieter atmospheric moments. While their debut record struggled to pull these dynamics together,  Lower Than Love  excels in these moments. Songs like ""Lower Than Love"" and ""Intermittent Depression"" highlight these stripped-down passages that create a vulnerability seldom heard from hardcore bands. By borrowing from Alexisonfire's  Watch Out!  playbook, Botfly deliver candid and emotional payoffs that separate them from many of their hardcore contemporaries.     Lower Than Love  is a successful dip into the unknown for Botfly. These songs feel honest and egoless, opening endless possibilities for the band going forward.

2021-12-03,Safiya Hopfe,8,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Arca's 'KICK' Cycle Is an Explosive Exploration of Her Multidimensionality,,"As a nonbinary trans woman raised in Caracas, Venezuela — at the height of social unrest — and suburban Connecticut,  Arca  (aka Alejandra Ghersi) is no stranger to existing in between worlds.    Since the 2012 breakthrough of her  Stretch  EPs she has played in the fertile chaos of liminality, straddling possibilities beyond binaries with ease. In her visual collaborations with transhumanist artist Frederik Heyman, for example (see the music video for ""Prada/Rakata""), esoteric symbolism meets CGI latex in fusions of human and machine. Her reconceptions of gender, genre, language, physicality, and erotic expression coexist in a transgressive multiverse where nothing is out of the question. Her music lives here, too.    Though she is known for helping produce  Yeezus , collaborating with artists like FKA twigs and Björk, and posing for portraits for Calvin Klein, the essence of Arca's creative mission is made most apparent elsewhere. Following positive reception of her 2020 album   KiCK i   (including a Grammy nomination), she released an LP composed entirely of remixes of the track ""Riquiqui"" generated by the AI software Bronze. Last year she released a single called  ""@@@@@""  which clocked in at 62 minutes. Her contributions to Philippe Parreno's installation in the MoMA lobby — a technological entity named ""Echo"" who responds to stimuli ranging from movements of the public to cloud coverage outside the building — have expanded into an online project (echo.world) which allows anyone to tune into the dreamscape of live AI technology.    She has a vast community of online followers who call themselves ""Mutants"" and, in 2015, she was banned from Instagram for art created with Jesse Kanda for her single ""Vanity,"" in which a cyborgian human is depicted with anatomically correct genitalia. Xen, the ""genderless being"" that shaped her  2014 album of the same name , was not just a character Arca made up. It was an aspect of her identity which she once used to sign off journal entries.    For Arca, fluid embodiment, category defiance, and the merging of dissonant worlds are more than abstract concepts. Her work exists deliberately beyond the margins of what can be neatly categorized.    The five-record  KICK  cycle also refuses to be reduced by a lens of linearity. A press release explains that Arca's follow-ups to  KiCK i  are not sequels, but fractal-like ""expansions."" Each is intended as a self-contained and totally unique world within a larger multidimensional self-portrait.    The first of these new fractals forays into familiar territory, further developing the avant-electro-meets-reggaetón universe Arca started building with  KiCK i . Sung primarily in Ghersi's native Spanish,  KICK ii  manages symmetry and catchiness despite its descents into the bizarre. Gravelly purrs and the sounds of blades sharpening collide with robotic heartbeats and the crackling of flames. Even at her most accessible, Arca refuses to paint from a predictable palette. But for all her experimentation and chaotic tangents, it is clear in  KICK ii  that she is acutely aware of the balance necessary to build a bop.    The record is nothing if not danceable, although the territory it covers varies. In ""Born Yesterday,"" Arca and Sia pull off anthemic pop. On ""Lula Llena,"" which translates into ""Full Moon,"" eerie otherworldly musings are subdued by a hypnotic dancefloor beat on the cusp of dissolution, while ""Araña"" invites listeners to tune into something resembling the soundtrack to a video game gone wrong.    If  KICK ii  keeps things weird while remaining approachable,  KicK iii  practically dares listeners to come closer. The opener ""Bruja"" makes it clear from the get-go: Arca will not cater to those easily spooked out of her turbulent cyborgian utopia. ""Hush it while I lick my bloody claws,"" Arca instructs. ""Did I stutter? Hear me roar."" An aggressive rhythmic pulse drives the 12-track album, which harks back to Arca's roots in underground dance music. She bends and breaks down structural formalities, letting echoes and aberrations create warped containers for incendiary sonic layering. There are moments which approach the lucidity of pop, such as in ""Señorita,"" the record's punchy lyrical centerpiece, and ""Joya,"" which closes  iii  on a note of all-encompassing peace. For the most part, though, the album bears little narrative consistency—only expansions and distillations of sound which create an ambience so overpowering it is inescapable.    We then enter the eye of the storm.  kick iiii  swaps cacophony for the serene comfort of atmospheric subtlety. Songs like ""Esuna"" grace us with raw orchestral elements which are seldom found in Arca's work. While ""Whoresong"" sees Arca describe her cyclical rebound from hardship and the ""bloodlust for beauty"" which guides her, ""Witch,"" a collaboration with No Bra, recites a hypnotic incantation and meditates loosely on Kristeva's ""abject"" over a stripped-down piano melody. In ""Queer,"" Arca and Planningtorock ode LGBTQ+ resilience, singing of the ""tears of fire"" inherent to the struggle in a sea of celestial sound.    By  KiCK iiiii , we are in truly subdued territory. An avant-classical journey into quieter realms, it privileges instrumental detail and tender lyricism over rhythmic intensity. In fact, the record is largely stripped of percussion. Even at its most upbeat, it is reminiscent of the sublimity of Aphex Twin, reminding listeners of the influences which shaped Arca's earliest musical ventures. The  KICK  anthology is an intergalactic escapade with occasionally violent pit-stops, and  iiiii  signifies our landing on a planet where peace is possible. One can practically hear birds chirping in the distance.    If the  KiCK  cycle is an ambitious attempt to make Arca's multidimensionality as human/artist/machine tangible in the formation of a musical universe, the result is neither fully cohesive nor flawless. Her apparent artistic worldview begs the question, though: is it supposed to be?    After all, the anthology began last year with the track ""Nonbinary,"" in which Arca takes wry stabs at those who are distressed by her sovereign ambiguity. Arca seems uninterested in guiding us from a starting point to a definitive destination. Instead, she invites us to explore layers of being with her in a descent/ascent that is constantly both departing and arriving.     KICK ii ,  iii ,  iiii , and  iiiii  demonstrate Arca's prowess in multiple worlds, as she curses in English and laments in Spanish, oscillating between softness and grit, symphonic realness and grating distortion. The records' stand-out moments are almost exclusively  moments : a glitch which grows to an arc, a sudden instance of sharp contrast, or a verbal assertion of badassery from Arca herself.  KICK  lacks a stable throughline, but it is perhaps the possibility of holding many discordant throughlines at once that drives Arca. The albums paint a self-portrait, and no human, no matter how cyborgian, is composed of parts which can be perfectly consolidated.    As a fully-formed whole,  KICK  is vibrant if not somewhat scattered. As a jumping-off point for more fractal-like expansions, though, it is explosive, with potential only really conceivable to Arca herself.

2021-11-02,Sun Noor,8,"MUSIC,REVIEWS,ALBUM,R&B",Curtis Harding's 'If Words Were Flowers' Blooms with Love and Optimism,,"There's no singular way to describe  Curtis Harding 's sound, aside from how it always manages to evoke emotion, immediately drawing listeners in. Nearly a decade into his solo career — following early stints backing CeeLo Green and as a member of the Black Lips side project Night Sun — his three albums demonstrate a progression within his sound. With each project, Harding aims to move away from minimalism, implementing new layers and textures into his music.    Third album  If Words Were Flowers  builds off of the multidimensionality of his acclaimed sophomore record, 2017's  Face Your Fear . On this latest effort, the multi-instrumentalist delivers a wide range of eclectic love compositions and opts to focus on the more positive and hopeful side of life. Harding also explores new territories, incorporating elements of jazz into his self-proclaimed ""slop 'n' soul"" mix while also embracing his gospel roots. That soulful foundation that encapsulates his sound remains prominent throughout the album, as the jazz and gospel influences linger throughout the record, creating a mosaic.    Drawing inspiration from an old saying of his mother's that stuck with him,  If Words Were Flowers  alludes to paying respect and appreciating people while they are still here. Throughout the album, Harding emphasizes the need for more love during these difficult times, and aims to look forward in a reflective and cathartic manner instead of dwelling on the negativity.    Lead single ""Hopeful"" sets the tone, with a cathartic feeling that highlights the importance of resilience. Harding illustrates the hardships faced by Black people and the need to move forward while paying homage to those who lost their lives. Instead of dwelling on trauma, Harding takes a positive perspective and conveys the importance of searching for the light within the darkness.    The first half of the record is lively, moving in an orchestral direction, with choral harmonies, horns and strings pairing well with Harding's leading vocals. ""Explore"" is a percussion-driven love ballad that swells near the end thanks to strings and an alluring theremin solo. Meanwhile, the last few songs adopt a melancholic yet reflective tone. The experimentation continues with the addition of the flute in ""So Low,"" a sax solo in ""Forever More"" and the prominent keys in ""It's a Wonder.""     If Words Were Flowers  is Harding's most experimental record to date, touching on a wide range of genres. This radiant record serves as a reminder to look forward and the importance of love during chaotic times.

2021-11-03,Katie Tymochenko,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC",SATE Pushes the Limits of Blues Rock on 'The Fool',,"Named for one of the tarot cards,  SATE 's sophomore studio album,   The Fool , embodies new beginnings and opportunities. When pulled upright, the namesake tarot card represents curiosity, discovery and spontaneity, but if pulled reversed, it could indicate one's hesitations to embark on a new project. Resonating with both definitions, SATE (the daughter of Canadian blues and jazz legend Salome Bey) has publicly discussed the reservations she had throughout the songwriting and recording process. Thankfully, her feelings ultimately subsided, resulting in a thought-provoking rock album steeped in sonic experimentation and exploration.    At its core,  The Fool  is concise and straightforward. While SATE's sound is rooted in the blues, there are hints of electronica, ambient pop and grunge sprinkled throughout the album. Lyrically, ""Howler"" is a fairytale gone wrong (""Dress me up then dress me down / Pose me in the way you like / 'Cause I'm not pretty when I frown / Nod my head 'cause I play nice""), and the arrangement keeps it real with blues-based guitar riffs and grimy licks. The subtle electronics recall St. Vincent, but the similarities stop there — SATE is unequivocally her own being, bringing a powerful sense of cosmic energy into guitar-based rock. Other highlights include punchy, riff-laden electro-rocker ""Famous,"" feisty early number ""Dirty Little Lie,"" and the grand ""Weight on Me.""    SATE's grand scope is furthered with a series of interludes that punctuate the tracklist, including soft-spoken poetry and ambient distortion sounds. Opening track ""0: loofeht"" acts as an overture with samples from each of the album's tracks. By doing this, SATE knowingly prepares the listener for what's to come by planting a sonic seed before the album properly gets going. The gesture is welcoming and allows for a sense of familiarity throughout the listening experience. Possibly the most significant moment comes near the end with ""#sfc,"" a spoken-word piece featuring Ursula Rucker that discusses doubts, fears and ultimate desires for creating art. It's an existential moment on the record that forces listeners to remove themselves from the album and witness the body of work from the artist's point of view.    It's a powerful moment that leads in nicely to the album-closing title track, which pairs emotional vocals with a poppy melody. Recalling '90s pop rather than rock, it showcases SATE's versatility and ends the album on a powerful and experimental note. It shows SATE's musical compass pointing her in ever-changing directions.  The Fool  is significantly less accessible than 2016's  RedBlack&Blue , and in challenging herself to expand her sound and narrative as an artist, SATE has arrived at a place of personal vulnerability and musical thrill.

2021-11-04,Alex Hudson,10,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Radiohead's 'KID A MNESIA' Still Feels Terrifyingly Relevant,,"In hindsight, Y2K paranoia seems absurd — but at the time, it really did feel like the turn of the millennium could reset the world's computer systems, resulting in a cyber-apocalypse that would throw our increasingly digitized world into darkness. It never happened, of course, but it did reflect the mindset of a world that had opened up a Pandora's box of technological possibilities without being quite sure what would come out.    Into this fray marched  Radiohead  with sibling albums  Kid A  (2000) and  Amnesiac  (2001) — LPs that blended rock music's past with a synthetic future, a sense of dread buzzing through a tangle of circuits and wires. The albums weren't about Y2K, exactly, but they foretold of mass alienation and societal collapse — things that, it hindsight, seem prophetic in a broad sort of way. ""Ice age coming, ice age coming,"" frontman  Thom Yorke  chanted over a cold, clanging beat, heralding the onset of a techno-dystopia as frigid and unnatural as the mountain range on  Kid A 's front cover. The words ""everything in its right place"" have never felt less comforting.    These albums — Radiohead's fourth and fifth, now packaged together as the three-disc  KID A MNESIA  — were famously born from a  period of writer's block  and turmoil following the massive success of 1997's  OK Computer . Most of the band hoped to continue with the rock sound they had already established, but frontman Thom Yorke, feeling repulsed by melody and enamoured with IDM artists like Aphex Twin and Autechre, forced the band down a path that avoided traditional songwriting in favour of amorphous abstractions. They nearly broke up, and producer Nigel Godrich quite literally divided them into separate camps while they worked on the material. To this day, Radiohead remain the reference point for rock bands who set aside their guitars and make alienating electronic music. But, 20 years later, what stands out about the sound of  Kid A  and  Amnesiac  isn't how influential they are, but how they resemble little else.     Kid A  in particular is fearlessly experimental but laser-focused, with a blend of styles that's wildly diverse yet seamlessly connected by haunting reverb and creeping anxiety. The album's middle section is breathtaking: a jazz rock freakout (""The National Anthem"") is followed by a dissociative acoustic lament (""How to Disappear Completely""), then by an ambient sketch (""Treefingers""), leading into the closest thing here to a rock anthem (""Optimistic"") and then finally a chilling harbinger of civilization's downfall (""Idioteque""). It's mercilessly bleak in its outlook, and yet the actual sounds — from the purring synthesizer and flittering robo voices of opener ""Everything in Its Right Place"" to the stately harps of closer ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" — offer some comfort amidst despair. It's so consistently masterful that it lends a sense of order to the chaos. If there's an ice age coming, at least we're in good hands.     Amnesiac  offers no such consolation. Although presented as a stand-alone album, it still feels a bit like a grab bag of oddments that didn't quite fit on  Kid A . Some songs are more straightforward than anything on  Kid A  (the  OK Computer -styled rock arpeggios of ""Knives Out""), while others are far more jarring. In particular, the start-stop beats and computerized voices of ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors"" bore themselves harshly into the listener's skull with the delicacy of a pneumatic drill, and half-formed instrumental ""Hunting Bears"" resembles an isolated guitar stem that was included on the album in some sort of error at the pressing plant.    But most importantly,  Amnesiac  has ""Pyramid Song"" — a spine-tingling masterpiece that's a shoo-in for any ""Top Five Radiohead Songs"" list. Its interpretation of a 4/4 rhythm is so complex that, 20 years later,  people are still trying to figure it out , and the lyrics are simultaneously vivid and total nonsense. ""I jumped in the river, what did I see? / Black-eyed angels swam with me / A moon full of stars and astral cars,"" Yorke moans, like a person who has been to the other side of a black hole and lived to tell the tale. It's avant-garde music at its most inviting, sounding freakishly alien and instantly transportive.    If  Amnesiac  is a bit scattershot, the bonus disc  Kid Amnesiae  is even more so. A collection of offcuts, it does what deluxe reissue bonus tracks are supposed to do: offer moments of revelation alongside strange castoffs that, even if they don't necessarily  need  to exist, give devoted fans insight into the creation of the album. The extras here are far less substantial than those from 2017's  OKNOTOK , as  Kid Amnesiae  plays out like a fever dream, with moments of familiarity blending together with scraps of new content, abstract vignettes giving way to more fully realized scenes.    A new version of ""Like Spinning Plates"" is particularly essential, combining the whooshing digital weirdness of the album version with the haunting piano arpeggios of the  beloved live version . It's as if Radiohead mashed up  Moonlight Sonata  with juddering backmasking to beautiful, unsettling effect.    ""Pulk/Pull (True Love Waits Version)"" is another absolute treasure for Radiohead completists: the rumbling beat makes sense of the chopped-up version that appears on  Amnesiac 's ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,"" setting a haunting groove for Yorke to sing a version of the long-elusive ""True Love Waits."" It stops abruptly and feels unfinished (it certainly doesn't supplant the version that appeared on 2016's  A Moon Shaped Pool ), but it offers further proof of how ""True Love Waits"" sounds gorgeous in practically any context.    The recent single  ""If You Say the Word""  is a clear highlight, its acoustic arpeggios and skulking rhythms fitting in nicely with the more straightforward moments of  Amnesiac . It's the only brand-new material here, and certainly the only track that sounds fully realized:  ""Follow Me Around""  is a long-circulated B-side, with strains of folk and blues that wouldn't have fit particularly well in any era of Radiohead; ""Fog (Again Again Version)"" is a peaceful new version of a B-side from the ""Knives Out"" single, its dry vocal treatment not quite gelling with the haunting atmosphere of the album at large. Several ""Untitled"" and ""Strings"" tracks place snippets from the albums in a new context, functioning a bit like a scrapbook for one of most legendary recording sessions in rock history.  Like new Oreo flavours , these bonus tracks aren't trying to replace your old faves — they're just intended to drive you back to the original.    As I listen to these songs, Facebook has just announced that it's rebranding under the parent company Meta Platforms, Inc., a move that comes hot on the heels of the damning Facebook Papers leak and ever-increasing awareness of how social media misinformation harms democracy and worsens a deadly pandemic. Donald Trump is launching his own TRUTH Social network — which, in a stranger-that-fiction twist, appears to have  directly stolen its code from open-source platform Mastodon . The quaint paranoias of Y2K now feel terrifyingly real. And while it would be an exaggeration to say Radiohead predicted this,  KID A MNESIA  carries just as much real-world dread as these albums did 20 years ago. Maybe our current fears will blow over just like Y2K did — but something tells me we won't be quite so lucky this time around.

2021-11-04,Jordan Currie,8,"ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Hana Vu Unpacks Uncertainty on 'Public Storage',,"Hana Vu  has had a brimming career, and she's still only at the beginning of it. The 21-year-old Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter has toured and opened for artists such as Soccer Mommy, Wet and Kilo Kish, collaborated with Willow Smith on the 2018 song ""Queen of High School"" and has been steadily self-releasing a sizeable discography, including the EPs  How Many Times Have You Driven By  (2018) and  Nicole Kidman / Anne Hathaway  (2019). Her DIY bedroom pop rock ranges from danceable synths to delicate, instrumental folk arrangements, where she often dissects the age-old themes of existentialism, failure and the fear of getting older, all of which are ever-present and fully fleshed out on  Public Storage .     Vu's experiences with moving around a lot in Los Angeles as a child and making frequent use of storage units informed the title of the album. "" Self-storage is just a collection of my things that I accumulate over time, and that's what songwriting is to me – notes back to myself of experiences, and stuff I was feeling,"" she shared in an interview with  NME . Moving and feeling unable to settle into one space is a motif on the album, first explored on the opening track ""April Fool,"" where Vu expresses an inability to communicate. The staccato piano chords and soft horns drawn out underneath them invoke the dreamy feeling of tiredly riding the train home after a long day. ""Aubade"" is an infectious dance track with bouncy synths and bass about  disappearing and becoming a new person where your old self can't be reached. Vu's alto voice is big and wide, but possesses a sleepy, languid quality to it — a tone reminiscent of a poppier Lucy Dacus, or Ella Williams of Squirrel Flower.     The chaos of uncertainty in the transitional period from childhood to adulthood brings the longing to believe in something greater or finding a place to belong. Vu has said she isn't a religious person, but on ""Anything Striking,"" she waits for something to guide her, whether it be a real life figure or a spiritual presence; the eerie descending piano and slow beats like the tolling of a bell, leading her down an endless hallway. The pulsating synths on single ""Keeper"" make for the type of cinematic tune that would play at a raging house party, but as the protagonist, Vu isn't interested in what's going on and longs to be elsewhere.      Public Storage  is not all brooding pop, however, and a handful of pleasantly surprising sounds lift it up from that realm. ""Gutter"" is pure grunge with crunching guitar riffs, and the strict, tight string section on ""Heaven"" sounds like it could have come from Empress Of's 2015 album  Me . The title track delves into Vu's contemplations on failure, family and defeat, but has the most classically indie rock sound on the whole record. ""World's Worst"" strikes the perfect balance between childhood innocence and the quiet, casual loneliness of adulthood. Soothing, plucked strings that resemble a music box build and blend into rousing percussion, but lyrically, Vu warns a potential lover of the turbulence of her life: ""Oh honey / I promise I'm the world's worst lover / You can tell all your friends / I wonder if I get much younger than this.""     ""Maker"" closes out the album, a hushed, tender folk ballad accented by the soft twang of a banjo and velvety, warm chorus harmonies that envelope listeners in a comforting hug. ""Can you make me anybody else?"" Vu sings. Though she seemingly poses this question out into the void in search of an answer, it's true that she at least is musically self-assured and fully realized on a debut as layered and meditative as  Public Storage .

2021-11-09,Alex Hudson,6,"ALBUM,REVIEWS,POP AND ROCK,MUSIC","Something Is Missing, Is Missing from Courtney Barnett's 'Things Take Time, Take Time'",,"Courtney Barnett 's best songs twist fleeting moments into profound observations — like the way she turned a real estate hunt into a  heart-wrenching meditation on mortality , or when she paused for an exchange of mutual admiration with a ""clever"" paramedic during a near-death experience.    Those moments, which seemingly used to come so easily for Barnett, are conspicuously missing from  Things Take Time, Take Time . Instead, the social critiques of ""Rae Street"" are pedestrian at best, as Barnett parrots a popular activist talking point when she sings, ""All our candles, hopes and prayers / Though well-meaning, they don't mean a thing / Unless we see some change."" It's a fair point, but hardly outside-the-box thinking if you've spent five minutes on left-wing Twitter. And on ""Write a List of Things to Look Forward To,"" she sings, ""A baby is born as a man lay dying / And so on it goes,"" a bland juxtaposition of life and death seemingly borrowed from Live's ""Lightening Crashes.""    Barnett still has a beautiful singing voice, with a nonchalant delivery that sounds like she's talking with melody. And just as much as ever, her songs hit a sweet spot between classic rock and '90s grunge. Barnett has a newfound interest for drum machines and songs that emphasize groove and atmospheric vibe over storytelling. ""Sunfair Sundown"" is a gorgeous tapestry of jangling arpeggios and steady thwacking electronic beats, and the songwriter drops a quintessential Barnett-ism when she sings, ""Shall we leave? Are you sure? / Let me grab my bag, we can sneak out through the side door.""    For a virtuoso wordsmith like Barnett, it's a bit of a backhanded compliment to say the best thing about  Things Take Time  is the guitar playing, since that's probably not why most listeners are tuning in. But it's certainly true of the deliriously wonky solo that ends the minimalistic bass vamp ""Turning Green,"" or the Real Estate-esque patchwork of chiming riffs on ""Write a List of Things to Look Forward To."" The guitar chops she showcased on the  outstanding tour  behind 2018's  Tell Me How You Really Feel  are on fine display here.     Things Take Time, Take Time  is an exceedingly nice-sounding record — but with almost no quotable zingers, it's hard not to shake the sense that something is missing, is missing.

2021-11-10,Chris Bryson,9,"IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Jon Hopkins' 'Music for Psychedelic Therapy' Is a Trip,,"The Tayos Caves of Ecuador are steeped in myth and history. Its landscape draws many seeking a special connection to its unique, natural wonders.     After his last album,  Jon Hopkins  felt it was time to reset, and find inspiration in another source. The UK producer made the decision to take a different direction with his next record, eschewing the beats and expansive ambient IDM of 2013's  Immunity   and 2018's psychedelic-leaning  Singularity  for something introspective and egoless, with raw, emotional honesty. It was from this that an opportunity arose to fulfill this purpose, bringing Hopkins to the Tayos Caves on a creative expedition that proved life-changing.     The expedition let Hopkins shift from a more abstract approach that sometimes unveiled meaning in time, to creating work inspired by a direct, personal experience. Hopkins wanted to create a narrative that gave the feeling of being in the caves, and, for anyone who hasn't been there, the results sound like he's excelled and then some. Two years passed between the Ecuador trip and writing  Music for Psychedelic Therapy . ""I really believe that there's so much to be said for letting an idea percolate,"" Hopkins has said of its process, and it's clearly had a profound effect.    There's an amazingly dreamlike sense to experiencing the LP in full immersion, enhanced by 7RAYS' woodland surround and multi-dimensional synthesis. Throughout the cave compositions, Hopkins improvised exquisite and processed flourishes over field recordings made by Mendel Kaelen, a neuroscientist and founder and CEO of psychedelic therapy music app  Wavepaths , who was on the expedition with him.     In a tradition used in many spiritual and healing practices, the album's opening ""Welcome"" grows slowly from a struck singing bowl into fluorescent drones and bubbling keys, drifting the listener towards the cave entrance on a chiming, sparkling astral plane. ""Tayos Caves, Ecuador i"" follows, and its massiveness is felt. As if floating through them, the details are vivid and tranquil. A distant lone bird sings dolefully as a sustained hum, created by a crystal ball's natural reverberations, lines the chasm and water falls all around. Further along, a melancholic melody trembles through the abyss like a healing heart, lulling the listener. In ""Tayos Caves, Ecuador ii,"" things have gotten deeper. It's felt in the immenseness of the drone and its deep space aura, recalling some of past collaborator Brian Eno's work, with sound signals being cast off into awe-inducing nothingness.     Part ""iii"" follows with whirring and strings that intensify around a sustained wistful counterpoint before emerging from the cave to a world abuzz with colour and life. Here, violins sing high notes and chirp among birds in their own rhythm, evolving into a softly shimmering orchestra. In their ascent back to the rainforest, Hopkins noticed the different choruses and layers of insects and birds and how they would change notes in unison, by their own internal logic, and attempted to mimic this unknown harmony by imbuing the song's instruments with their own unpredictable unity.     Much of the collection has a trance-inducing effect, like the engulfing and glittering ""Deep in the Glowing Heart"" and ""Ascending, Dawn Sky."" It's an ingenious record of expertly woven environmental music, always in a state of enchanting motion, and as one dedicated to being  Music for Psychedelic Therapy,  it will surely succeed on that front for many. But it also succeeds in being, as it was described pre-release, not quite classical, drone or ambient, but an effort that draws from all three.    Hopkins shapes each element with refined, instinctual care – nothing distracts or lingers for too long – creating comforting spaces for the mind to wander, get lost, or find itself in. There's a feeling of flowing through serene, yet vital space, with each sound possessing its own special place and magic, acting as tiny guides on this spiritual odyssey.     For the first single released from the album, ""Sit Around the Fire,"" Hopkins collaborated with ceremony guide and producer East Forest to score part of a '70s talk by late spiritual and psychedelic luminary Ram Dass. The song, which closes the LP, is the only one to feature words, and feels like the perfect end to this meditative journey.     Music for Psychedelic Therapy  is a magical union of nature and creativity, a space where the mind can open, and do so with transportive beauty. Over pensive keys, Dass speaks to expanding love and celebrating the inner flame – the spirit – within everyone, the need to sustain it, and the need to just be, summing up a part of humanity's shared experience with the album's final lines: ""all we're going to do for eternity, is sit around the fire."" It's a simple, remarkable close to a work of such depth, and one that's also a beginning.

2021-11-10,Stephan Boissonneault,9,"DANCE AND ELECTRONIC,POP AND ROCK,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Technical Kidman's Mathieu Arsenault Soundtracks Self-Discovery on Seulement's 'EX PO',,"EX PO , the debut album from Seulement (aka  Mathieu Arsenault of Montreal's  Technical Kidman ),  is an electronic collection of songs that explores the idiosyncrasies and the frenetic energies of self-perception, and it could not have come at a more unprecedented time. Right now, much of society is rewriting the very fabric of their being, either deciding to continue down the same road they once lived, pre-pandemic, or transform their life into something greater.     This is what  EX PO  is truly about: coming to terms with the fact that you've been molded by constant, simultaneous media, subconsciously or consciously, and determining if it's a right fit. It's looking at yourself in the mirror and dissecting the pieces that make you, you.      Using an array of samples, FM radio feedback, decaying blips and bloops, and his menacingly passionate voice, Arsenault presents these personal themes and then slowly morphs them into something that becomes more and more unrecognizable. At times you hear muted, but tense paranoia (""ENVERS""), sensations of strained memory (""TRANSIT""), and quivering vocal work, bringing an image of Arsenault almost at the point of tears (""PLI"").     His voice is the glue that holds the chaos together and the lyricism — derived from a more phonetic French, stream of consciousness space — puts his listeners in a trance, only broken by a few dramatic pauses between tracks.      "" EXCEPTÉ 1 ,"" begins with a recurring crackling and bouncing, sort of like a game of electronic pong, and then turns inward with the first set of anthemic vocal melodies about bending bodies. It sounds as if Arsenault is leading you up a grand spiral staircase, surrounded by oscillating geometric patterns and shapes, to an unknown, vague reward of your choosing.      The title track ""EX PO"" continues this build, introduced by a flatlining heart monitor and then waves of claustrophobic, distorted static. Again, Arsenault loops and layers his voice to create a choir that guides you through his micro world.      Watching the corresponding visualizers, what Arsenault calls ""artistic collaborations,"" created/directed by Myriam Bleau, Véro Marengère, and Charles-Andre Coderre — all championed visual artists whose work has been presented at MUTEK, ACOUSMA, and others — adds another audiovisual interpretation to  Seulement's  musical frenzy. They're definitely recommended viewings when listening to the tracks for a second or third time.      EX PO  is only eight songs, but has an almost theatrical beginning-to-end programming. It could be called required listening for any experimental electronica fans or anyone remotely interested in the genres surrounding, but has been too shy to dip their feet in. It's just weird enough for the hardcore electronic purists, but Arsenault's voice makes it increasingly accessible.

Blur  hasn't performed since a one-off gig for one of Albarn's Africa Express events in London in 2019, the seemingly pandemic-proof  Gorillaz  are busy celebrating the  20th anniversary of their debut , and  the Good the Bad & the Queen  is a wrap; how about a solo album inspired by 17th century poetry then? Enter  The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows .    Gleaned from a line in the John Clare poem ""Love and Memory,"" the album title is alluded to in its first track, which offers a contemporary adaptation of the first two stanzas in Clare's poem. For Albarn, that mostly means swapping out Clare's formal thous and thees, though he does skip ahead to cut and paste some lines from Clare's seventh stanza (""The year has its winter / As well as its May / The sweetest leave us / And the fairest decay"") before landing on the words that open the third — the same Albarn's album and the first track borrow their titles from.     Clare's poem balances a sense of loss with appreciation for life's gifts; Albarn's subtractive touch denies  his bleak, observational lyrics the sense of closure Clare's glass-half-full reflections do.  Fountain  goes on to rehash old memories like a doomed time traveler trying to right the course of history, Albarn returning to the album's title phrase on ""Royal Morning Blue"" and ""Particles"" as if attempting to return to the poem's lesson or rewrite its ending, his ending, too.    As a meditation on memory,  Fountain  frequently measures memory's transportive quality against the limitations of the physical world. On ""The Cormorant,"" Albarn is imprisoned on an island unable to touch the passage of time, but he can ""drift day dreaming""; on ""Royal Morning Blue,"" the persistence of thought and memory resist the passage of time.     It's a more focused effort than scattered 2014 solo debut  Everyday Robots  and more delicate than the bulk of his back catalogue, but Albarn's still drawing outside the lines. The album began its life as a classically inclined instrumental piece inspired by Iceland's rugged beauty, but when the pandemic hit, he had to pack it up and finish it in Devon, a shire county in South West England, where  Fountain 's sound profile exploded to include synthesizers, drum machines, and all manner of noises.    While ""Royal Morning Blue"" matches a downcast provincialism with the pulsing verve and buoyancy of a Gorillaz track; ""Combustion"" smacks with sax skronk and deflating ambient synth passages; ""Darkness to Light"" swings like a modern doo-wop crooner. ""Esja,"" on the other hand, is a patient orchestral instrumental, mounting strings communicating a ceiling-less expansion. But as the instrumentation progresses higher and higher in the octaves, the intensity feels claustrophobic — distance has a way of freeing you as much as it isolates.

While the Atlanta songwriter's relationship reflections aren't unfamiliar territory, her demonstrated artistic progression is what elevates these themes beyond classic breakup record tropes.    Walker leads off with a Cardi B confessional on ""Bitter,"" and ends  Still Over It  with invocations from another special guest on ""Ciara's Prayer,"" showing her own curatorial skill and substance in having her guest artists reveal authentic life experiences. It's also what leads to inspired features from Omarion (""Screwin"") and SZA (""No Love"") as Walker's lyrics contrast with their honest contributions, while the standout ""Toxic"" features a refreshingly vulnerable verse from Lil Durk.    Of course, Walker's own voice and relatability work to carry the nicely paced 20-song album. The bulk of  Still Over It  spans an emotional spectrum of  breakups, self-doubt and renewed freedom, until the aptly-titled ""Closure"" allows for Walker's voice to shine through controlled pitch changes. In contrast to her debut, she has become more melodically adventurous, while that aforementioned vocal control is imbued with a greater effortlessness.    Walker also shows an improved ear for beat selection:  t hrowback banger ""Dat Right There"" has its upbeat nature supported by the Neptunes, and when the production gets more varied on the afro-tinged ""Unloyal"" with Ari Lennox, the results are spectacular.     While its subject matter isn't anything unexpected to Walker's fanbase,  Still Over It 's  storytelling arc and risqué production choices add depth to make this collection more than a  solid R&B album.

2021-11-12,Nicholas Sokic,8,"REVIEWS,ALBUM,POP AND ROCK,FOLK AND COUNTRY,MUSIC",Cedric Noel Confidently Asks the Tough Questions on 'Hang Time',,"It's difficult for an artist to remain both prolific and good at their craft, but  Cedric Noel 's  Hang Time  — coming a year after his  Patterning  and  Nothing Forever, Everything  releases — assuages all doubt.     The Montreal songwriter's latest album wastes no time enveloping listeners in the sort of ambient folk-pop that is his stock and trade. Opener ""Comuu"" launches immediately into its marching percussion rhythm building fivefold, and all anchored by Noel's vocals. Throughout the record, his voice entrances and commands without overpowering, thanks to his ability to build to a sense of inevitability while remaining soft, even vulnerable.    Take ""Dove,"" a duet between Noel and  Common Holly . It doesn't linger in pretense, with the pair beginning the track singing, ""I tried to care about trivial things like love / to waste away trivial things like love."" The rest of its runtime is spent repeating wordless vocalizations over a simple, reverberating guitar line, but rather than feeling incomplete, the song functions almost like a simple equation for emotional devastation.    Much of the album deals in questions of friendship and allyship. The album was largely written in 2017 and 2018, as Noel contemplated his status as a Black musician in a mostly white indie rock community. This conflict is presented most obviously in  ""Allies,""  in which  Noel plaintively asks ""Are you on my side?"" atop a sample of Malcolm X speech. That the otherwise gentle, probing song ends in a cacophony of noise and a garbled yell keeps in theme with the album's moments of mounting intensity, while also speaking to the discomfort in questioning whether or not these allies are in fact genuine.    Noel's occasionally triumphant choruses, bolstered by drum work from  SUUNS ' Liam O'Neill on seven of 13 tracks, helps to keep the album confident and assured in spite of the difficult questions it asks of love and relationships. Naturally, it often presents as the sort of confidence that can only arise from asking such difficult things.

2021-11-12,Nicholas Sokic,8,"FOLK AND COUNTRY,POP AND ROCK,REVIEWS,ALBUM,MUSIC",Casper Skulls Find Beauty in Childhood Trauma on 'Knows No Kindness',,"Knows No Kindness  finds  Casper Skulls  a long way from the shoegazing rock of previous material, from 2015's  ""King of Gold""  single to 2017 debut LP  Mercy Works . That applies to their personnel change in new drummer Aurora Bangarth, as well as their switch to a dreamier, more expansive — yet still grounded — sound.     The album centres around vocalist Melanie St-Pierre's experiences growing up in Sudbury and Massey, ON, before moving to Toronto. In turn, the experiences range from the soaring to the heartbreaking. The album largely matches the simultaneously icy and inviting atmosphere of a typical northern Ontario community, and many of its tracks evoke a long history, such as  ""The Mouth,""  written about a park St-Pierre went to often as a child.    This is most evident on standout track ""Witness,"" a song based on St-Pierre's experiences testifying after witnessing the murder of her best friend's father. It's chock-full of strong storytelling details, anchored by a steady pacing and unobtrusive guitar, but it's the last thirty-odd seconds of St-Pierre asking with a plaintive bitterness, ""What have you done?"" that best conveys the emotional impact of the traumatic tale.    The band's soft-heavy approach to lyrics and musicality invites comparisons to '90s icons Mazzy Star, in that many of the tracks feel anthemic without becoming overpowering or staid. Others, like ""Rose of Jericho,"" take the folk-rock approach to pondering love in an ever-changing world — fitting for a song named after a resurrection plant.    The album title and self-same track refer to American Modernist painter Georgia O'Keeffe, who was also a frequent collector of bones in the New Mexico desert. Once, she wrote, ""The bones seem to cut sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive on the desert even though it is vast and empty and untouchable – and knows no kindness with all its beauty."" That titular track focuses on St-Pierre's fear of death, as borne from her childhood experiences. But as a whole, Casper Skulls' latest batch of tracks all balance on a similar knife's edge — finding the tender and beautiful in the trauma of one's formative times.

2021-10-21,Tom Beedham,8,"POP AND ROCK,IMPROV & AVANT-GARDE,ALBUM,REVIEWS,MUSIC",Grouper's Latest Brings Every 'Shade' of Liz Harris into Focus,,"Over the past two decades, Liz Harris has embarked on a series of northward moves up the Pacific — Los Angeles, Portland and then further north in Oregon to Astoria — implying a relationship to the coast that is at once deeply identified with it and without roots. Similar purgatorial circumstances haunt the music she makes under the  Grouper  alias, itself an allusion to Harris's childhood growing up in the Group, a commune inspired by the Fourth Way Christian philosophy of George Gurdjieff — to being of a world without belonging to it.    Capturing songs Harris has been working at for 15 years and nearly as long as Grouper has been active,  Shade , Grouper's 12th studio album and Harris's first since her 2019 offering as  Nivhek , feels like a career in focus.    Rich with expansive tape hiss and reverb-affected voice and guitar fog, opening track ""Followed the Ocean"" immediately articulates  Shade  as typical Grouper landscape. Or, landscape as portrait — Harris is a ship without a port, watching the world around her transform, erode, disappear, but she's trying to connect to it; hide from it too. After spending 2014's  Ruins  and 2018's  Grid of Points  exploring works for upright piano and voice, the track feels like a return to the drone buried spells of early albums like  Wide  and  Cover the Windows and the Walls , but then the noise drops out a second into ""Unclean Mind"" and we meet a Grouper we haven't heard, virtually unadorned acoustic guitar and voice, fingertips squeaking on strings as Harris moves up and down the fretboard, clearer than ever before, and then signal becomes noise: ""Tried to hide you from my unclean mind,"" Harris sighs, harmonizing with her own vocal track, ""Put it in a costume / Turning patterns with a perfect line.""    That these are some of the clearest lyrics in Grouper history isn't insignificant. Harris has previously said that her music is ""more honest to the way my mind works when it is blurred and gestural; more meaning comes across,"" and here, her lyricism achieves something similar — that Harris is her most accessible when describing the process of making her inaccessibility inaccessible is itself a blurring. Harris relishes in these paradoxical between zones.     On ""Pale Interior,"" Harris's words lap into each other as she sings of sleepless nights and hiding places erased by nearby lighthouses. On ""The Way Her Hair Falls,"" Harris struggles to make external things recognized internally, fumbling a guitar progression multiple times, adjusting her fingering and reconvening, preserving the track's incompleteness and documenting something between studio and field recording, a decision that diverts attention from the song's lyrical content.    Hiding in plain sight, Harris maintains the purgatorial quality that consistently makes Grouper's most indecipherable performances such comforting places to return to and hard to pin down; there's something so out of reach and unattainable about them, yet the same neglect of an authoritative voice demands listeners bring their own meaning(s) to the songs.    Submerged in reverb, the penultimate ""Basement Mix"" is more typically indecipherable as Harris's breathy sighs accompany ruminative guitar arpeggios and we're left to follow spare clues: a titular reference to somewhere deep, subterranean, foundational — subtextual? Remarking on 2011's  A I A  double album, Harris once claimed ""That album was torturous to produce,"" and that, ""I didn't finish feeling clean. I'd been living in a basement studio by myself for a year trying to finish it, and when it was done I didn't like it.""    Given time to breathe, to live, to coast, with  Shade , Harris has found a new stream to navigate, but with distance, it's clear Grouper doesn't have to commit to one world or another to enjoy their comforts. Maybe we don't need just one Grouper either.
